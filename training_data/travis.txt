Yessir!
They say when you lose don’t lose the lesson
But it’s hard to live in peace when you’re used to stressin'
And I admit
Man, I’m still getting used to blessings
Because these kids in the struggle, that’s youth depression
I guess that’s how you’re supposed to feel when every moment is surreal
And every woman that you’re running to is unaware of your skill
Niggas try to hack you or bring you down like Shaquille
But you know you got that potent shit, you just hope it appeal
Young OG on the field, this is white glove rap
If white people feel that all blacks love rap
They who cut us the deals and the bad contracts
Stil we sign it, cause the cars out there, we wanna be riding
Fly and shit
Toast a champagne with my real niggas
Screamin pain of your shame niggas

Look at this life we built, ain’t it enormous?
Hold up, wasn't one of your niggas informant?
Dropping them name tags, hold up was he mormon?
Man, I’m high as fuck right now
I know my momma ain’t gonna like that, but she know my sacrifices
And I don’t have many vices, always gone just like I’m high
And hard to find like a satisfy, bet you my bday
Always got a new dress, but don’t like how much that she weight
Niggas wanna ride Benz, but they ain’t driving
Niggas be clubbin the LIV but still ain’t living
Yeah, I admit, I am a part of the problem
I go out and get paid, I go hard for the bitches when I used to stay home
Now these bitches in my section get their champagne on
Aye if you wanna get her better and not wait long
Cause she study with jady and Judy and the great stone
Ah fuck it nigga we on
I ain’t lying, put that in a spect between my teeth and I’m sizing
But this bitch in the diamonds, designing
Like who life you aligning, spend the time and do criming
And no way why these bitch niggers chiming
Only can sort importance to gain aportion proportions
And hold a bunch of the corpses, the ugly wives or the gorgeous
We’re the victims, notorized only when it’s a victim
Justifying lies we’re coming to crime acceptum
It’s the sick niggers who only can wish better
And numb feelings, we love em through spent cheddar
My momma always told me don’t fall in love with material
But nothing matched the feeling of finding toys in your cereal
So here we go
Now we’re on our way to zero, zero, zeros
That’s countless for all our mommas
Money, music and marijuana
Now we’re on our way to zeros, zeros, zeros
Money, music and marijuana we owWe leaders of the future, fuck the past
I fucked her head first, and ass last
Before I see that hearse, you trash bags
Might as well call the church, it's a hell alert
She wanna be home before the dust up
I told her "bitch you grown, shut the fuck up"
Made it too far from home, for me to nut up
So it won't be long before I blow up
I'm with Miss America in Bulgaria
She left with dat bear, yeah I might tear ya
She say I'm too mysterior for her caterier

Lit late night on this side
This side, this side
I made a lot of money on this side
Lost a lot of money on this side
Had my first kiss on this side
Learned a lot of shit about this side
Lately I been thinking 'bout this side
Tryna get back on this side
Tryna get back what's been mine
Really miss the feeling of the late nights
Shit we used to do around midnight
Hangin' on the corner, had shit tight
Doin' all the drugs, had to get right
If I could bring my partner back it would be nice
He would shoot the one, wouldn't think twice
He was too involved with the street life
Only way to live on this side
On this side
Bitch better have my
Yay-yay-yay-ya
Yay-yay-yay-yay-ya
Yay-yay-yay
Yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-ya
Yay-ya
My albums called Birds in The Trap Sing McKnight
And I'mma keep it short for this explanation
But, its basically its you know
Anybody creative thats kind of like been stuck and had a problem getting the idea out, it took me 8 months just to get the "90210" video out, with Hype Williams
It took me six months just to get the action figure out
It shouldn't take no one, no artist that long, you know
Just to you know get something idea out
Especially something thats going to culturally shift
You know, the world musically
Now the music's more towards the independent artists
I feel like in a couple years
We all be able to fly around and do what we want
Cause, I wanted Andre 3000 with the whole album
I had this play idea, Act I, Act II, Act III
And then later on I was like
With the visuals I can make it more of a play
But theres no way I can make a album out of a play
I'm too much of a rager for this shit to be like (sorry, stuff)
For Stuff, for stuff to be to that you know
I didn't want people to overthink it
I didn't want it to look too much so I feel like the
Only thing that needed to be complicated was my title
People to understand it, and the music straight forward
And thats exactly what it is you could have a party to this album and just let the whole album play
I want to start with "the ends" thats my favorite song even if you skippin' around you gotta start there
Travis Scotts taking over the show
It's Travis Scott in the morning
It's Travis Scott its HOT 97 in the morning
Wait why do you get to talk
It's Travis Scott in the morning, let him say it
Hot 97, Ebro, Rosenberg, Laura Styles lets get it
Ebro I don't know if you realize this
Theres probably a pretty good chance, knowing Hot 97
It will be Travis Scott in here at some point and I'll still be sitting in the same seat, its a pretty good chance
I think what happens is they bump you out and keep me, in a order thats the order of operation
Wait, Travis out of all the young artists, you are on what, your third project now, you were one of the artists I gravitated to first just cause I can understand what you're saying
I'm just figuring out Young Thug, like I was late to it, but the style of music that you're creating who, who were you inspirations, who did you pattern yourself after, you're 24 now?
I looked up to M.I.A. and Kid Cudi man he's really one of the main dudes I kinda looked at and listened to all the time
He saved my life
He saved me from doing random bad things to myself
Kept me focused like..
Just through his music or personal relationship
Just through his music because I didn't meet him 'til
The first time I met Kanye was the first time I ever met him
But I didn't really meet no Cudi until like earlier like
Late late late last year when he came by the studio one time just to like talk to me
What was it about Cudi's music that spoke to you so much?
I feel like he really dialed in on like, the youth and really dialed in on like, inspiration, how to inspire you
His words were very selected, on like what to do
I feel like he always made the soundtrack to my life
Or anybody's life who was like going through the same thing
If you a big Cudi fan you know exactly what I'm sayin' like, he says the exact same things you growing up with
But makes it sound way cooler
I went through this, I went through that
My mom didn't have this, we had to go through this
You know we had to go through Christmas to do this
But the beats and everything just sounded like
You know, the Nutcracker
Do you think, do you think
And you were saying off the air too
Do you think he gets credit for being a cultural influence?
Nah not at all cause I think, you know
Cudi should be like a top tier artist up there man alongside
With these other artists who like, are number one, you know
I think he fathered a lot of, a lot of the music
A lot of style of music
Well, we know what he did for Kanye for sure, like
Everybody talks about that
He's a good influence and you know, a good help
His writing and his mind
He makes beats I don't think people know that
He made "Sky Might Fall" you know, he made mad beats
He made some beats on 808s and heartbreak, he's super dope he can write
Speaking of which, who did the beats on this album, on your record
Vinylz, I always work with Wondagurl on every album
Can't do a album without her
TM, this kid named dax, Murda, Cardo
Its weird though, I only have 4 producers or something like that 4-5 producers
You wrote with and worked with Rihanna
You wrote with and worked with Kanye West on several things
Some other artists, I don't want to run through the whole thing But what else are you doing besides writing your verses
Well when I first came into the game I made beats
Thats what I did, I had to give people my own beats
As a artist I lost a lot of lot of lot of time to make beats
I wanted to focus on raps because I felt like when I came up here I wasn't the best rapper, I had the best beats
I was doing Cruel Summer, I worked on Yeezus
With those albums, like by the I got to Jay Z albums
I was already having ill songs, so it just turned into me just giving people my songs, you know
On 'Ye album or her album, so on
I sat and worked with them on the whole album
Whether it was for two or three months, picking mad beats
Whether its different people beats or, taking out the drums
Putting my drums
How do you know how to like craft something for someone else
I always see it, I'ma tell ya'll something about myself
I was always making music
Mimicking other artists, when I was 13-14 years old
Making beats and making music just to get the sound, right
And so like, I think every producer, any young producer
So like when they make like their favorite rapper
Made that beat, make the same rap just to understand okay this how they did it
Just to understand it completely, okay the breakdown
So when I grew up, I was like you gotta translate it to your own songs, so that kinda grew me up like welded me
I'm a big fan of people man, a lotta people feel themselves
Thats so important that you say that because
Not a lot of people come out and say yo I'm a true fan and I love
Who are you the biggest stan of you've worked with so far, musically
Kid Cudi but
But I'mma say, I'mma say, I've been in the studio with Jay-Z dawg
And at first I was not that a big of a Jay-Z fan bro
But bro, bro, bro bro
I don't even know how old this guy is (no one knows)
This dude, I've never seen him pick up a pen
I seen him do the Magna Carter
This dude's freestylin' the whole album, with facts though
You know, him and Andre 3000 too though
Lotta people be talkin' bout Andre
Like why he not dropping music
Man that man has information man
He know how to play the piano man like
Frank Sinatra style, Beethoven style
I tried to get it out
It's Travis Scott takeover, let me bail him out
We don't want this to get crazy we want this to go right
What's your favorite
Of the songs you've been involved in for other people, whats the one you're most proud of? The one they hear it on the radio
They're like man thats a great record, I'm glad I did that
You know what, the most I'm proud of is uhh
The one thats not out yet man, the one thats not out yet
Hopefully come
I know that
So its Birds In The Trap, there's song you didn't put on it?
No you mean a song with someone else, a collab, collab
Like you worked on a record
You worked on a Kanye song or a Rihanna song
When you hear it you're like yes I love that
Oh I thought you said a album I thought you're sayin' a collab
Oh yeah thats what I'm saying the song thats not out yet
Yeah its with Kid Cudi. Facts
He says that based on Facts
Ebro
Well lets get into another record from Birds in The Trap Sing McKnight, what do you want to play man
You gotta prep em "sweet sweet" then "goosebumps"
Shoutout K Dot
Thank you Punch bro, I love you, you the man
Were you surprised like did you know you would get that done
Or were you surprised when it got done
I'mma keep it all the way 100 man
A lot of these features on the album
I was surprised every time someone was like, Yo I'mma at least try
I'mma at least try, when I hit up Brock shoutout Brock
I need this K-dot verse
I seen he had a show
I seen they were singing "Antidote" and was doing it with them
Like I'm on Kendrick radar
That was the second time I was him, I met him at the VMA's before like
He walked up to me like yo man my names kendrick da da da
Yo, your music is very inspirational, I love it, its like super dope
I love your last album, I was like what?
You be barring, bro you be barring N's out like
You be R.I.Ping N's on the track man like
You just walked up to me and was just like yo
I'm Travis, when I be rappin', I be really listening to your music
Like this dude just said a lot of bars man
These raps I got be lookin' like this spaced out man
I'm like man
Were you in the studio with Kendrick when you recorded
Nah cause he was dropping that album
I think he dropped the Untitled album
So as soon as that album came out
He sent me, Brock sent me the verse
Like "yo he hit you with the verse"
I listened to the whole song I always thought the song was so good
Yo when that dude hit the high note
I was like yo man this dude is on some other shit
I think he really go in the booth and make moments when he's 'bout to kill peoples tracks
I think they make R.I.P. tees when he bout to go in
They press em up like
We bout to do this Control verse
We bout to do this Travis verse
We bout' to RIP everybody, like for the year
We gon' line up everybody grave sites
Like, boom we got Travis right here
I think he purposely..
I be wanting to call him man, like who you mad at bro
You be blacking out on these things like
But thats the mental man
And thats why he the greatest artist man cause he got that focus man
Cause I don't care if its a feature, I'm treating it like its my song
You know what I'm saying, and as a artist, thats how I treat the beats when ya'll see me get on a feature like the "No Limit" Usher joint I had to redo the whole drums on the whole thing
I ain't like the drums, I wanted the drums to be harder
And You could tell someone like Usher like nah I don't like this the way it is
Yeah, Usher came to me like if you wanna do the drums man take it over, and I was like, Thank You
But thats gotta be a crazy honor coming from someone like Usher
But thats what I'm sayin' like
I be in the studio with these guys and like
They be like yo man, please man just like
Take the drums, take whatever
Take this out, you know what I'm sayin'
And I just be like yo ,this dude know how to turn this up
This dude know how to do this, he know how to do this
I can do this, I can get us all in a room
And this is whats gonna happen, know what I'm saying
A few years ago, everybody was talking about you
I think it was the freshman show
You come through, and there's T.I involved
Theres Kanye involved, theres nine different labels involved
And the conversation in the industry
Theres a thousand chefs in the kitchen
Is it ever gonna come out
Is the Travis Scott thing ever gonna
Are you super satisfied you are out there you are fully a entity
Yeah yeah its just so weird
People think these dudes are with me all the time
Thats just not the case at all
I probably talk to these guys 3, 4, 5, 15 times a year
You start at three and went to fifteen
I might talk to T.I. three times a day in one setting
Right it just depends
Who total do you work with besides those big names?
It was a third one too?
It was Kanye, T.I. and someone
Travis: I talk to 'Ye every single day
Both of us I can't say one of us is more crazier than the other
Are there ever times he's going off giving ideas and you're like
"damn Kanye you goin' in right now"
And there are times he looks at you like
"damn Travis you really got ideas man"
Yeah we really be looking at each other like damn we just really be like
I have audio of travis and Kanye talking
This is what is sounds like
Bro, Bro, Bro, Bro, for 90 minutes
At least minimum
And I got a special verse coming for that in a couple days
And we gotta talk about these new projects you said you were gonna tell us about
And this is okay to tell us about
You're not gonna mess anything up
No we got gonna mess nothin' up, I got you
I keep secrets, don't believe the hype man
Hold on, you can't leave without telling us about the G.O.OD. Music release
Cruel Winter, I'm executive producing that album
Its coming very soon, I wanna say like the top of next year
I'm putting the pressure on everybody, I'm saying February
How many songs done right now for Cruel Winter
I would say we have a lot of songs done
How many songs picked, I wanna say a handful
We got a lot of songs done
We just gotta sit down and lock in all on a wave
Everybody's involved, Desiigner on there too?
Kanye West, every G.O.O.D. music artist involved
Every G.O.O.D. music artist involved
Its like amazing, and you know
We got like our illest friends
And its going to be one of the illest projects
But one thing I can say about this project is
Its going to be very youthful, straight to the point
Like the illest ever man, just like the best album
What does that mean? youthful
That means the kids that are not on the radio all the time
Who really got the clubs going ridiculous
Really have the fields going crazy thats what this album is for
Real quick speaking of Kanye what has Kanye told you about your album, what does he think?
Man you know honestly he called me like "Yo"
I just finished the album on the Saint Pablo tour right
He called me like "Yo man I didn't know it was this crazy
I heard you when you were mixing it but just yo
It sounds way crazier listening to it 1-14"
That's what got everybody so excited for Cruel Winter
How I just finished that album like the last couple of weeks

“My vision was being ahead of what’s going on—like two, three years ahead.”
Scott’s childhood home in Houston, where his mother worked at AT&T as an Apple liason and his dad ran his own advertising business, soon became a revolving door for friends and randoms from school who wanted to record. “I was always in a group,” he says, speaking of his early projects. “I feel like my shit was tainted because either somebody’s voice wasn’t right or I was sounding corny as fuck,” he says. “I was in a group with another rapper. This nigga was like my best friend. I had a vision and he had a reality. Those are two different things. My vision was being ahead of what’s going on—like two, three years ahead. He was living in the reality, hanging out with niggas he would think was his friend. It was the downfall of everything. You gotta learn how to completely not fuck with people. That’s a hard thing to do. Just keep walking. Trusting your own vision.” Some of those projects, including TravisxJason, a duo he was part of with a rapper named O.G. Chess until they had a falling out in 2011, can still be found with some creative googling. Their full-length, Cruis’n USA, is promising, largely inoffensive and miles away from the darker terrain Scott would soon inhabit with Owl Pharaoh, his biggest artistic statement to date.
That mixtape, released last spring, is a joyfully dark collection of maximalist, wheezing tracks that lumber under their own weight, gears grinding to push out laconic future music hatched from Houston’s long lineage of screwed-down songs that evoke codeine and candy paint and drowsy psychedelia, but imbued with Texas’ lonely flatland and Scott’s husky, often deadpan voice. Scott’s been on a Robert Rodriguez kick lately. At one point, mid-sentence, he pauses to look at the TV, where a trailer for the director’s Machete Kills comes on. Scott points at the screen. “That’s why I gotta work with this guy,” he says, as the actor Danny Trejo, stone-faced, stalks across a burnt yellow desert landscape in slow motion.
Scott’s sound is ambitious, but it isn’t exactly experimental. Instead, he’s working in the anything-goes mold already supplied by numerous artists before him: West’s towering artistic statements, T.I.’s elastic voice, the Neptunes’ digital experimentation. Like any kid that grew up in the internet era, Scott has absorbed everything around him, blended it together and come out with a style that is a product of all music everywhere existing on the same plane. Nothing is off-limits when you have access to everything. And with that access, Scott is dead-set on mastering every art form he takes on. “I was always about doing both,” he says of rapping and producing. “I wanted to learn. I wanted to know how to do it. That was my biggest thing about everything. I wanted to know how to use everything. That’s why I do videos. I know how to work a camera, edit a video. I just want to know. I don’t like someone knowing more than me.” His music is an appropriately cinematic reflection of his open mind and keen ear, blending iconic phrases from other people’s radio hits with a production style that evokes every regional rap trope, from New York’s claustrophobically heavy drums to LA’s slow-rolling funk, without sounding like much of an imitation of any of them.
The first time you hear his voice on “Uptown,” a highlight from Owl Pharaoh, he sounds pretty much like how you’d imagine the devil to sound. Over grating, hyper-compressed strings, his multi-layered voice grunts, I’m riding up uptown/ WHOO! I’m a motherfucking monster/ WHOO! One hand on the wheel one hand on my dick. Then his words start speeding up, finally colliding into each other in a manic fit: At the green light I’m speeding/ Fourth wheel on, I’m weaving/ I got red eyes...swag seizures. The motherfucking monster line is a callback to West’s “Monster,” but here Scott sounds like he’s living up to the impossible claim. He sounds inhuman.
Even in his day-to-day life, Scott has the energy of a hyperactive teenager. He works constantly—often in hotel rooms or random studios scattered all over the world—but he’s rarely alone, and, if he’s not making music, he’s always in motion. He climbs on things, wrestles his friends, knocks over lukewarm water into a pile of Swisher shards, tosses his shoes into corners and then kicks them into other corners. He wanders New York with the familiarity and complicated emotions of a former resident. At one point, he scores a pair of green BAPE sandals that are basically modified Birkenstocks, and he wears them everywhere the very next day. Later, at the boutique clothing store Surface to Air, he tries on a sweatshirt, but his friends deem it too small, so he sits down on a bench, hits his G-Pen and puts one of them in a headlock.
- “Travi$ is not here to make number one rap songs. Those people get high off of making number one songs. I’m into making number one fucking albums.” -
It’s this surplus of nervous energy that makes Scott such a compelling performer. Live, he makes every stage seem like it’s actually a trampoline. He is never not jumping, flailing, pacing, climbing rafters, screaming his voice raw. There’s a video of a performance at New York’s club S.O.B.’s last summer where, just over three minutes into his set, he already has his shirt off, the room is pitch black, the crowd is chanting along with him and it looks more like a hardcore show than a typically discerning, not-impressed-by-anything, dead-eyed New York rap crowd. In interviews, though, Scott is all over the place, half-finishing thoughts, going on hilarious tangents that take him miles from his original point. But his enthusiasm skews these moments as charming, not embarrassing. When he talks about his long-delayed first meeting with West at the Jungle City recording studios in Manhattan in 2012, while working on Cruel Summer, his story is a mess of clipped sentences that dead-end even as they get more enthusiastic:
Scott is clearly working in the shadow of West, not only in the tone and cadence of his rapping, but also in his disinterest in participating in a traditional path to fame. Success for Scott doesn’t mean being the most visible, or making the most hits. It means having a clear vision of what he wants to do. “I feel like I’m the opposite of the system—I’m the opposite of what Mike WiLL is,” he says. “You will not be able to compare me to a Mike WiLL or to a Young Chop or any of these niggas that make number one rap songs. Travi$ is not here to make number one rap songs. Those people get high off of making number one songs. I’m into making number one fucking albums. Extended long projects that are consistent. That system is the A&R calls you, like, Oh I need a beat for this nigga’s album, for so-and-so’s album, like a Mariah Carey.”
Scott’s belief in the emotional power of the album format isn’t just willful ignorance of the music industry he’s part of, though. He saw a disconnect between what labels wanted and what he was looking for, and decided to follow his own instincts so that he wouldn’t be manipulated by an out-of-touch industry. “Niggas was going mad platinum because they couldn’t download music for free,” he says. “That’s what labels gotta realize. It wasn’t just because you was the best motherfucker alive, because y’all the best label. It’s just because niggas couldn’t access the internet fast enough. Now niggas is smarter than you. It’s like the fat white man sitting in the chair, like, Ah, yes, we got these motherfuckers, they can’t get this shit for free. This is the only way you can buy it. You cannot be commercial no more. You must be real.”
Apparently, realness is synonymous with fearlessness for Scott, because during the numerous photo shoots he participates in for this story, he inexplicably finds himself in insanely high places. At one point, he’s crouched precariously on the corner of the roof of a photography studio in the Flatiron District, a coat hanging from his body like a high-fashion version of Batman’s cape. His face is partially obscured by the fabric, Phantom of the Opera-style, but his grill—which he is currently stretching his mouth wide to show off—is glinting in the remnants of the evening sun.
Not 24 hours later, he’s on the top floor of a very tall construction site. The building is still unfinished, so everyone is wearing hard hats and ugly neon vests. The floor is littered with construction equipment and massive metal girders. Scott’s surrounded by exposed concrete foundation that’ll eventually be covered up. Right now though, people are taking pleasure in writing their names and the date all over the wall, anxious to be an invisible part of the city’s history. Scott wants to do this too, so, Sharpie in hand, he scoots himself up some wiggly plywood that’s angled against the wall and writes his name in blocky letters on the grey surface, shading in parts of the T after he’s done writing it all out as big as he possibly can. The marker is thin, so it’s not really visible unless you get up close, but he works meticulously anyway. A couple times Scott slips back down the plywood, but he wedges his feet, grips the pen and gets back to work. Pretty soon, all this will be covered. Probably no one except some construction workers will see his name here, but he’s leaving his mark anyway, exactly how he wants itI ain't playin' with, I ain't playing with these niggas (Straight up)

You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the...
Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju… okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin'; I'm beast

They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when you get to shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it

BlaqNmilD, you a genius, you diggin' me?
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city…
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone

Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that Oliver, 40, Niko shit man
15 Fort York shit, y'know?
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
(Yeah!)
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and whoa
Yeah, and you know how that should go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that should go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
And you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my
I was running through the 6 with my woes
And you know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S
"I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem."
"Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?"
"Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry."
"Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?"
"Enough with all this talkin'."
"Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Yeah, straight up to my face, tryna play it safe
Vibe switch like night and day
I can see it, like, right away
I came up, you changed up
I caught that whole play
Since, things never been the same
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)
I don't trust a word you say (I don't trust a word)
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
(That's just what I heard)
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me

Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Skrrt
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bills shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA

Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO

Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, "Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes

Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
Cause we—
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here

No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame

Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are
Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg
Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "Goddamn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all (Damn)

But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad

Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up

And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
You're not gonna come?

This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Momma is a saint, yes, she raised me real good

How many girls have slept in this bed?
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass

I keep buyin' shit, just make sure you keep track of it all
I got bitches askin' me about the code for the Wi-Fi
So they can talk about they Timeline
And show me pictures of they friends
Just to tell me they ain't really friends
Ex-girl, she the female version of me
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I hear everybody talkin' 'bout what they gon' be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see
I got money in the courts 'til all my niggas are free
'Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me
Well, run up when you see me, then, and we gon' see

Got a lot of people tryna drain me of this energy
They tryna take the wave from a nigga

(I'm off this)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah
These days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix (Six)
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before
Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to
These days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason you love me
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my
She said you're my everything
I love you through everything, I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk, are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?
Yeah, these days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
All I gotta do is put my mind to this shit (Goddamn)
Cancel out my ex, I put a line through that bitch
I like all my S's with two lines through them shits
Everybody tryna fuck you but I'm fine with that shit
I never mind, girl, that's just you
I know you work hard for your shit
You know they gon' hate
Just don't play no part in that shit
They should call me James
Cause I'm goin' hard in this bitch
We're just so much smarter than them
Maybe I just needed you around me
Drank a lot tonight, I know
She can drive your car and you can roll
Take you where you wanna go
First off, I'ma start by sayin' this
Goddamn, goddamn
I think I killed e'rybody
In the game last year, man, fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams
At the strip club, mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah, it's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right
Three in the morning, still going down
Worst...
Mothafucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit...
Niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'...
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see am I finished
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior
Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money
When I come for that shit like O.D.B
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior
Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior
Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place
Or how it's decorated
This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now
Yeah
All she talkin' bout is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
All she hit me with is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me"
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking

To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones

Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can’t pull

You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here

I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six, soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade

Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about it, talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (Woo)
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Look, look
I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum
I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Yeah
Wheezy outta here
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then
Yeah, uh
Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more

He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year

Places that I should've been

Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus

She think I’m the realest out and I say, "Damn, that makes two of us"
Aww, that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm, go ask them who just killed the shit

Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)
A shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)
A shot for me
Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says "I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place; not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misin-terpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)
A shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-whoa, oh, whoa)
A shot for me
Yeah

Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And heaven accept you

LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a "Are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit
Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in, ha!
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours
Yeah, I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last two-hundred twenty-three thousand hours
And it's 'cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
I got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na-na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat-flat
And your ass on "What's that?"
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl, not right now
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in her— man
I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to—
Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl, you throw it back like one love
Even let me slash on the tour bus
Yeah, I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood, I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet?
I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to—
Would you fuck me for free?
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know
They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah!
I be yellin' out, "Money over everything! Money on my mind!"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, "They miss the old Drake", girl don't tempt me
"If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do"
I'm like, "Why I gotta be all that?"
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know
I be yelling out "Money over everything!"
"Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!"
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah…
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush
Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say some
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh
Bitch, this is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her shit, it is what it is (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb shit
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush
Dedicate, I dedicate the world
Yeah, oh
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate, oh yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate to you
They throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna ride, fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back and never on the side, uh
(Yeah)
You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it
Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me? I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (Don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
'Cause we never decided, tell me how you feel inside
You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it
Yeah-yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say, "A guarantee"
I mean, you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive
But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song's for you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my voice
This song's for you
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall

I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)
We live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)
Yeah
I'm working on dying
I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool
I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check
You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (Ayy, ayy)
Every month
She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?
I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know (That I know)
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know
Yeah, views, views, views
Yeah, yeah, alright
Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop
I’m building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man, woo!
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure (yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!"
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place. All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together, and the times I used to look after you. And I still have wonderful feelings about that. So God bless you, and I hope I'll see you...
M-M-Murda
Yeah, yeah, never been no fraud
Why do niggas that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do niggas claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Weezy F and Nick
All come and spoke about your shit in '15
Man, I know you niggas saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like grrrrrr
But they don't pay in cash
Niggas see me like, "What up, Killa?"
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, "Man, why him?"
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw Nick the other day
And she keeps getting finer over time
I just know
It bothers me when the gods get to actin' like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don't be duckin' like you never wanted nothin'
It's feelin' like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from D.C., that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million-dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North, that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty Ms
Kobe my nigga, I hate it had to be him
Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym
(Huh! Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said "fuck it," I'm tearin' holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix, and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em, "Butterfly it, she'll love it."
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin' my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fuckin' finish line; we can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker gettin' mine off rap, with my niggas (Huh!)
Maybach Music
I'm about bein' single, seein' double, makin' triple (Right)
I hope you pussy niggas hatin' never make a nickel (Right)
It's good to make it better when your people make it with you
Money comin', money goin', ain't like you could take it with you (Alright)
It's about to be a hit right now, fuck back then we the shit right now
Dropped Take Care, bought a mothafuckin' crib
And I'm pickin' up the keys to the bitch right now
OVO that's major shit, Toronto with me that's mayor shit
Gettin cheddar packs like K.D., OKC that's player shit
We don't dress alike, we don't rap alike
I shine different, I rhyme different
Only thing you got is some years on me
Man fuck you and your time difference
I'm Young Papi, Champagne
They know the face and they know the name
Got one watch that could prolly pay for like all your chains
And you'd owe me change, ah!
Greystone, 20 bottles that's all me
On the couch, wildin' out yelling free my niggas 'til they all free
One of my closest dawgs got three kids and they all three
But we always been that type of crew that been good without a plan B, so
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah
Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind so
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life
It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah
Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said "no strings attached" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you; instead, they say:
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Dom Rosé toast
Hidden Hills where I post

Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, "Poor me"
Where you at? I never see you
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It’s bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lot of niggas goin' bad on me
Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me pay it no mind
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Hidden Hills where I post, yeah

Far as troublemakin' goes, yeah
House party up the road, yeah

This kid doesn't play about the flow, yeah
Y'all keep playin' with your nose, yeah
You get high and do the most, yeah
How you let the kid fightin'
Ghost-writin' rumors turn you to a ghost?
Oh, you niggas got jokes
Free smoke, free smoke
Yeah
We got London on da Track
This is all God's doin', man, you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details, then I'm Satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinkin' like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitchin' underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talkin', I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only twenty-nine, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga (Yeah)
Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she know that we at war, yuh
Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'

Put me in a fucked-up position (21)

And I'm sellin' out arenas but you puttin' on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
'Cause if I don't share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow?
Mom's stressed, there's a lot of things we need
Chain smokin' in the house, it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my Ts with Febreze
Jordan pull up in the TL, now I'm cheese
I'ma turn this TSX into a Benz soon
I'ma see a lot of blessin's for my friends soon
Hunnid-fifty-inch screen in my bedroom
6'1", man, a nigga need some leg room
Shit ain't been the same like before
They ain't even wanna look up at the score
FaceTime with my shawty on tour

Niggas keep reachin' and dissin'
Put me in a fucked-up position
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, don't
Isn't it amazing?
How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different"
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends, if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', baby
Yeah, swanging
She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say: "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was
And never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
I'll be here, just swanging
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin'
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good, girl, like you're famous
I know I'm late, it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl
Yeah
We had the type of nights where mornin' comes too soon
And nothin' was the same
Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Yeah, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?
Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been? You deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay
So if you rebuke me for workin' with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's makin' your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours then let him repeat
Now you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheets
Tired of sittin' quiet and helpin' my enemies eat
Keep gettin' temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You're not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle
And hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to they higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger workin' double time
Y'all actin' like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly makin' me hits
But then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it
My spirit did it, I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playin' with my name
And I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby, "I'ma done him for you"
Tell 'Ye we got a invoice comin' to you
Considerin' that we just sold another 20 for you
To be honest
Duppy
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Another one
Yeah, I stay down with my day-one niggas
And we in the club, screamin'
No new friends, no new friends
No new friends, no, no new (DJ Khaled)

Sweet like Pearland, sweet like Peachtree (Like that)
I can tell you crazy, but shit kind of intrigue me (No, yeah, I like that)
(I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
Seen it on the 'gram, I'm tryna see that shit in 3D, mami
I know I get around 'cause I like to move freely
(I don't, I don't)
But you could lock it down, I could tell by how you treat me

You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business (Get it)

Rolling swishers, hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it (Naw)

You too worried 'bout the bitches (What you worried 'bout?)
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it (Try a ting)
She'll admit it, she'll admit it (Try a ting)

You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain

I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this, I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
Yeah, so I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now
Yeah
(Wheezy outta here)
Jeez, jeez
Back home, smokin' legal (Legal)
I got more slaps than The Beatles (Beatles)
Foreign shit runnin' on diesel, dawg
Playin' with my name, that shit is lethal, dawg (Who you say you was?)
Don Corleone
Trust me, at the top it isn't lonely (Strapped)
Everybody actin' like they know me, dawg
Don't just say you're down, you gotta show me (What you gotta do?)
Bring the clip back empty (It's empty)
You asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg (Sent me, dawg)
I just broke her off with a 10-piece, dawg (10-piece, dawg)
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day
Yeah, lot of Murakami in the hallway (What?)
Got a sticky and I keep it at my dawg's place
Girl, I left your love at Magic, now it's all shade
Still goin' bad on you anyway
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day
Yeah, alright, yeah
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em)
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us
Stop, stop, stop…
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so and so’s that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky leggin'
Trust me this information is vital
I’m tryin' to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s somethin' that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We goin' live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killin' people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up!
(Stop, stop, stop, stop…)
Have you seen me?
I’m doing so good
Every time we meet:
"Oh, I’m so sorry."
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)
"You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long
Industry people… regular people…
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak."
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will
But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
And you're like oh well
You're like, "Fuck it. Oh well"
My past behind me like a pony tail
But you my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will
Okay I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things you can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more Henny and you're past the limit
You told me 'bout the picture, now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will
Dirt and grime and filth inside
The story of my lifetime
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are
G-G-G-Good work, Charlie
(Perfect!)
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(You!)
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man, you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man, they would have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man, they would have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk, they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', now y'all get the message?!
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (You!)
Ten-thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (You!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (You!)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Sonic boom!)
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury
I give 'em Grey Poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!
If you ain't poppin' shit then why you rap for, huh?
Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
(We did)
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (You!)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (You!)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah, ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are
(Perfect!)
Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though
Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?
Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeah
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace
I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace
I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone 'til November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house takin' no calls
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wri
I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what? I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky, I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me, someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to
But we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin'
On some "why-you-love-these-strippers?" shit
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit, oh!
Oh, me, I don't deserve it (at least you fuckin' know it)
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man, I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer
Hit me when you're done your shift, yeah
I need some company, I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is "Leave me alone"
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, "Why let the story run if it's false?"
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then
Yeah
Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys-forever, hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga
Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like, "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a walkie-talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch, check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge" song
"I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-you-thought-it-was" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga
Ayy, I gotta stay in my zone
Say that we been beefin' dog, but you on your own
First night, she gon' let me fuck 'cause we grown
I hit her, gave her back to the city, she home
(She at home now!) That was that, so
I can't be beefin' with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you livin' in a mansion in all your raps, though
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though
We been brothers since Versace bando, whoa
Name ringin' like a Migo trap phone, whoa
Used to be with Vashtie at Santo's
That's on Tommy Campos, we live like Sopranos and I—
People around you
Should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact
That you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends
That you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you
That you do the right thing, ooh
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down
But I gotta say
Oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her
Already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before
This can't be your first time
We musta been here before
It's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit
That somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before
This can't be your first time
They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice
Then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too
We're perfect for each other
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down
But I gotta say
Oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her
Already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before
This can't be your first time
We musta been here before
It's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit
That somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before
This can't be your first time
You musta done this before
This can't be your first time
We musta been here before
It's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit
That somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before
This can't be your first time
You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)

Uhh, ah yeah
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money, yeah, yeah
You know who you are
I got you
Yeah, why you keep askin' me about... (Why?)
She's not here right now, she's not here right now
Why am I the one you wanna get into it with for the drama?
I've got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now
Spendin' all my days on the east side, oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now
Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up
I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
You can be the one to take control, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me
Why you keep askin' me about... (Why?)
Couple other things I'd rather do than talk about that right now
Told you 'bout givin' him chances on chances on chances
He's not holdin' you down, he's holdin' you back right now
Spendin' all my days on the east side, oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
Love it when your ass speak the truth to me, oh
Tryna wake up and have you with me, oh
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up
I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
You can be the one to take control, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me
Yeah, ayy
Yeah
I I threw my hands in the air and said show me somethin', yeah
Ayy
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house
She made tea for me
We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, "When that shit is real, you just know"
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me
That my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' 'bout, "You gotta leave already?"
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said "You're mine" I was yours already
22, had the Bentley four-door already
Even as a boy, I was the boy already
So you know that that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for Third Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time 'cause I lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime say you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy
You would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy
You would prolly kill another man for the boy
You would prolly...
You would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy, yeah
(Why? Fring)
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was "what's the hold up?"
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders
Champagne
Bitch, who do you love?
I got a shorty name Texas Syn
She got a buddy named Young JB and now you know the deal
We turnt up in the studio late night
That's why the songs that you hear are comin' real tight
OVO crew, nigga, thought I told you
If you a player in the game, this should hold you
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did the motto, took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big
Young Money shit, me and Lil Wayne too big
I'ma crush that ass even if it ain't too big
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big
Wassup
Nigga we straight and we hood
Ain't nobody ever gave us shit
When you see us shinin' it's because we steady grindin'
We stay paper chasin'
Separatin' the real from the fake
The fake from the real
We livin' to die and dyin' to live!
Nigga, that's why we got so many women
I'm tryna go deep, hit them asscheeks
Bust them guts, make her cum
Bitch, you know the game!
Ain't a motherfuckin' thing change!
Bitch! Who do you love!?
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, oh, gone on them)
She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me (Close)
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself, I need to take it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Railiza, you need a... money and visa
And you get what you want, always from me
I can't say "No" when you say "Please," I can't say "No"
Howisha, you need a... baby with me, uh
And I'm takin' my time, just wait, don't leave
I can't say "No" when you say "Please," I can't say "No"
You wanna drink like Bajan and dance like Trini, yeah
You want a supermodel pose like mi real friend Winnie (Like mi real friend)
Yeah, vacation is done but I'm not finished, no
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, gone on them, gone on them)
She tryna take it all off for me (Close)
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself, I need to take it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
I stay to myself, I'll explain myself, I can't play myself
Oh, first night, holy night, five in the morning, yeah-yeah (Yeah)
And it feels like you're mine, signs of the times, oh, what a time
Playin' it right, playin' it perfect
Laughin' it off, but I know you're hurtin'
Signs of the times, I say all the time
Taking my time, just gets harder to find it
But you're playin' it right, you're playin' me perfect
She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself, I need to take it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
She says, "Kiss me like you miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
And when you’re fuckin' someone else
Just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic, don’t I? I get it poppin’, don’t I?
I’ll end up stoppin', won’t I? And by the time I end up stoppin'
You’ll be rockin' one of the rings that you pointed out
While shoppin' with a nigga, don’t lie
She’s losin' it right now
'Cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now
But instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now
But this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me, then she says she done with me
You say that you over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes: don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo' shit, I put you back in your place
She tells me, "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with too?
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make
I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn, I guess I'm proving it right now
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone
Oh, oh-oh
She is here and we're so gone
Oh
Oh, oh, oh
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

From you when I get home (Yeah)

Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty
Haven't even heard from you (Yeah)
How can you live with yourself?
I haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself? (Uh)
Ungrateful
Ungrateful (Hmm)
Your mom'd be ashamed of you
I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you
Ungrateful (Hah)

You should go back to him, perfect match for you, unstable (Hah)
Doing me dirty (Dirty, dirty)
You're making me nervous

Girl, them late nights ain't good for you
Really starting to show on you
Don't hit me up when it's good for you
Ungrateful
Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am....
Unruly, unruly, maddas

I don't know what's wrong with me, I can't stop, woah, yeah
Won't stop, woah, yeah, never stop
Got so many opps, I be mistakin' opps for other opps
Got so many people that I love out of troubled spots
Other than the family I got, it's either you or me
That's just how I think, it's either you or me
This life got too deep for you, baby
Two or three of us about to creep where they stayin'
Black leather glove, no sequins

Then I hit a spin 'cause we spun their block a couple times
If it's not the right time, there'll always be another time
I'm not even trippin', we'll just see 'em in the summertime, woah, yeah
Can't describe the pressure I be puttin' on myself, yeah
Really, I just can't afford to lose nobody else, yeah

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one
Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid

All I ever asked is one
Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it
Demon just got out the can (Yeah)
I gave my bro an advance (Yeah)
Love is just not in my plans
Not even takin' a chance
Studio right in my yaad
I'm doin' ten in a week
How long I been on this streak?
Dream about work in my sleep (Oof)
Okay, I got a lock on the streets
Shoutout to T, he did three
And he brought it in 'cause of me
You don't know nothin' 'bout me
Life for my bruddas is deep
Long as they all on they feet
Long as they pockets is greaze (Greaze!)
I'm in the penthouse but still, nothin' is sweet (Yeah)
Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep (Mmm!)
Taller in person, you'll see when we meet
I heard your new shit and I'm kissin' my teeth
Jheeze!
October Firm
Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife
But I do know one thing though
Women they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way
Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunnin' for the title
Lot of people tryna take us viral
I'm just tryin' to have a nice night though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, "Babe, I think there was a typo"
Nah, girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watchin'
But I do know one thing though
Women they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday, Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way
Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah
Uhh, I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like "what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?"
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "Fuck it, I’m on one"
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "fuck it, I’m on one"
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said "I’m on one", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said "fuck it, I’m on one"
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
Yeah
You would think it's all mine the way I took it (Yeah)
You would think it broke down the way I push it (Yeah)
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't? (Yeah)
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just tryna be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
You hit me like "I know you’re there with someone else" (Yeah)
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio, so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text (Yeah)
I want to get straight to the climax (Straight, straight to the)
Yeah, have you coming all summer like a season pass (Yeah)
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back (Yeah)
'Cause you talk like you got what I need (Yeah)
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze (Yeah)
Talk like you bet it all on me (Yeah)
And you can't take no Ls off me
I know you been
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just tryna somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
Yeah, I get it
I get it, yeah
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (think about me)
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah
Say to you—but eighty percent of it wasn't true, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough, and then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven
Yeah
I know
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare, myself, myself
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh

Thinkin' what if that happened to me too

Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Ayy, hospital band a hundred bands, fuck a watch
Hundred grand'll make your best friends turn to opps
I hear y'all bringin' my name up a lot
Guess I just turned the clout game up a notch
See, y'all really shocked, but I'm really not
You know how many girls I took to the titty shop?
If she get the ass with it, that's a 50 pop
I still bring the bad bitches in the city out
Uh, just a different type of leader
We could be in North Korea, I could smoke with Wiz Khalifa, uh
Told my wife I've never seen her
After I hit it, bye Felicia, that's the way that I'ma leave it up
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
See, this is why all the bitches fuck with Ye!
Fuck what they talk about!
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
They take me on meds, off meds, ask yourself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Ask your homegirl right now, "Look, you had a shot at Ye?"
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
You'd drop everything!
Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2C-B, huh
This is why your bitches fuck with me, huh
Smash, she gon' end up on TV, huh
Last thing that you ever wanna see, huh
I can feel the spirits all around me
I think Prince and Mike was tryna warn me
They know I got demons all on me
Devil been tryna make an army
They been strategizin' to harm me
They don't know they dealin' with a zombie
Niggas been tryna test my Gandhi
Just because I'm dressed like Abercrombie
You see? You see?
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!
That's why I fuck with Ye!
See, that's my third per-
That's my bipolar shit, nigga, what?
That's my superpower, nigga, ain't no disability
I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero!
Agghhh!
Wrote this shit, January 21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person
First thing they say is, "I know you need a break."
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—

AXL (AXL), AXL (AXL), AXL (AXL)
Woi-oi
Ayy
I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name
Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train
Ayy
Yeah
AXL (AXL), AXL (AXL), AXL (AXL)
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah

Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now

She will
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas

Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Porque todos te quieren probar (Ah)
Lo que no saben es que no te dejas llevar de cualquiera
Y todos te quieren probar (Nah)
Lo que no saben es que hoy yo te voy a buscar (Yeh-yeh)
Dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabe' que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías
Cuando yo te lo hacía (Yeh)

I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
Yeah
Yeah
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to "R.I.P." about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it
Yeah, gotta love it
*Laughs*
Yeah
Yeah
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight
Uh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot but I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, "Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah"
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)
Sometimes I need that romance
Sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper
That's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall, yeah, I need that
Making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)
Haha, damn
Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, "Where the check though?"
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left, ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though, voicemail say she ready though (Yeah)
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'Cedes Benz pedal
Doin' ninety on the bridge like, "Nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin up the angles, now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four, five chains, man the gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "The first mill' gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it, then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work, ayy
Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)
Yeah
I remember I had went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East 'cause them boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out, the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah
They did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, man
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man
Hear what?
Yo hear what, take time
(Ha, ha, ha) Ahh, no shit
Yo hear what?
Wa gwan fry skull
Him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van
You know Drizzy
Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah
Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ayy)
I do better with the rider in my system
Ooh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy, peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't
I been had these visions of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we--
Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, yeah, my niggas really need the whole thing, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ayy)
Yeah
I know we just signed a deal, but
I need my advance on the next one too, they know I'ma be around
Yeah

You and yours vs. me and mine
Oh, we talkin' teams? Oh, we talkin' teams?
Oh, you switchin' sides? Wanna come with me?
Look at the smile on me, look at the owl on me
I do not chase girls, but they run a mile for me
Say she gon' ride for me, I'll buy the tires for you
This game is different, you only get one shot when niggas go foul on you
Man, fuck 'em all, man, we want it all
Don't get too involved, we gon' knock ya off
And to top it off, I'm with all the dawgs
It's a new season and we still breathin'
And I got a really big team
And they need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin' with no strings

Standin' over coffin with a hammer and a nail (Two)

Whatever you did (Ayy), it is what it is
And I'm so tired (Tired)
I fuck with the mob and I got ties (Lotta ties, lotta ties)

Boomin out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will

I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like MacGyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Yeah) Work the night shift
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Work, work the night shift)
Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with nigga's souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Yeah) Work the night shift
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Work, work the night shift)
(Lou)
If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me
Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you 'round, I need you, oh
I wake up on a daily basis
I count the money, man, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with the dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
Wake up and pray every morning
Demons, they callin' my soul (Hold up)
I said fuck all of you hoes (Hold up)
I'm ballin' outta control (I'm ballin')
I'm ballin' outta control (Let's ball out)
I'm ballin' outta control (I'm ballin')
I'm ballin' outta control (Let's—)
I need acknowledgement (Need it)
If I got it, then tell me I got it then (Tell me)
I'm ballin' outta control (Ballin')
Keep on receiving the scholarships (Woo)
Mayor comin' to the house (Woo)
Nigga, please, watch your mouth (Watch it)
I'm the one without a doubt (Watch it), yeah
And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Drafted, I'm gettin' choosed by these hoes
Usually, they just leave when we done
I don't wan' share no room with these hoes
Metro gon' make it boom on these hoes
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes
We got that purple rain for the pain
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't change, yeah
Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "What scent that is, boy?"
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house "the embassy"
The studio "the chapel", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, "Where does the day go?"
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira
I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, I
These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is
If you get hit, you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again
I don't let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again and again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I'm Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might could fit you in on Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that's making triple what I'm making, what an entrance
That's when you know it's a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out, it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas to just make the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on they neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, your shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin, they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I
Drop down, drop-drop (Shit is real out here)

Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
They don't work hard as you, damn that's so crazy
At the end of the night when you count, numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money, girl you just did it
I get it I get it, man fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit
12 months on the lease, that's a come up baby don't you ever forget it
Connections are heavy, every real nigga they fuck with you
Nails chipped out in diamonds, you sparkle but fuck man
The spark ain't enough for you
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Tonight was your night, go get you some lobsters and shrimp
You smart and you know it, I get it I get it, you outdo these pimps
I hope you don't fall, that's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story, I get it, you did it you did it
Got a link on the champagne, your best friend is bar-tending
Your parents saying this another phase in your life
They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit
I get it I get it, I'm working too hard let's get into some fun shit
281 to my city, heard you had trouble at customs
Your girl got a DUI, I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, "Girl get your paperwork right"
I get it I get it, what's up for the night?
Get it, get it, get it, drop down, drop drop down
Get it, get it, get it, drop down, drop drop down
Your momma used to live at the church on Sunday
You just go to LIV after church on Sunday
Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore
We're not in Kansas anymore
One of dem ones—right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, "What are those?"
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right, yeah
Still in Miami, most of these girls are too messy
I gotta do some reflecting
I gotta find me one out here that's good at taking direction
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrrrr!
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type, yeah
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight, yeah
PND ain't with the ray tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here going way way way way way way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in they feelings these days
All in they feelings these days
But hearing a scripture with that many 6s, you should be afraid
Word on road is the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on the low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean

Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies

She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all tires
Girl, they love me like I'm Prince, like the new king with the crown
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)
Ooh finally got you right here
Tonight I’ll ease your mind
That’s why I’m calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
It’s hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you

Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say, "Okay, if you say so"
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I could never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go?
Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action

Niggas like "You took the summer off? We couldn't tell"
Dawg, just bought a island, gotta sail to it

I go huntin', put heads on my fireplace, oh my
Take time, ain't no tellin'
Oh my, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, more, yeah
More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linen'd out
More blessings for Sandi and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a "not guilty"
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still, they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos

You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is, me, I don't judge
I'm just going off what the math is, numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, "What have you done for me lately?"
"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest."
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces

I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink

Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, woah, woah, woah

CC bag look nice, but the Birkin bag look way more heavy
That's just a big gyal ting, man, you get me?
Raemi just turned mommy, and that's my sis, so I just turned abti
Fan mail came to the crib from a yute that loves me, I swear that touched me
I never even drive no whips I own, so they all look way too dusty
If me and Gallest go St. Michael, the gyal come way too fussy, crushy
Man said they would do this and that, but the man wasn't really that wassi, was he?
Nah, nah, nah, the man wasn't really that what?
One-nine-four-two hits my system, man get way too frosty, buzzy
Girls from the past that lost me love me

Slow stroking 'cause the bamski way too big, my gyal don't rush me
Woi
Don't make me have to rise my rifle
Man try send some young boys for me, don't make me have to ride by high school

Nuff times he tried to hide behind you
Amnesia but when I remind you

Sickos, ah man

You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
Y'all don't understand, I'm the one they want to hear from
Y'all don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yeah, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that, woo!
Dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we 'bout to land I can call to tell the woes I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while

Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (Lifestyle)
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (Do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum (They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl, let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me
They still out to get me, I don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
Give a real nigga the number one
Even though I got like twenty-one
Cannot be me I'm a one-of-one
Schooling your ass like 101
They been out here tryna slide on me
They been out here telling lies on me
Everybody looking out for themself
But they still got they eyes on me
See me putting in the hard work now, ayy
Momma doesn't have to call work now, ayy
I decide when I start work now, ayy
Problems hit the gym, they all work out
MVP, MVP, oh-nine all the way to sixteen
Even next season looking like a breeze
Lot of y'all ain't built for the league, yeah
Trade you off the team while you in your sleep, yeah
Y'all showed me that nothing's guaranteed
And you don't know what you started
My friend's chain so big that he look like the artist
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (Lifestyle)
Yeah, yeah
Envy is a sign of admiration
Hate: It’s the epitome of destruction
Celo sus besos sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera así de mí y te quiero aquí
Odio ese hombre porque está a tu lado
Perdí tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada, nada
Uh, you were the one
You've been the one from the moment I seen you
Sometimes I question if this is all real
Then I grab on that ass and I firmly believe it
And you look like you drawn by an artist
No you, you look like Bernice and Yaris
But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home
If you saw 'em you'd get it
Look don't worry about it, keep speakin' Spanish
I'll get it translated, you know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby
Don't stay with this new guy, I really go crazy
I really go crazy
Every lost girl I know is over 26
Every lost girl I know is just too afraid to admit it
You give your body to me, I'll body that like a savage
Give and take, you give it to 'em
They take that shit for granted, yeah
Different than it was before
People 'round you want it more
BFF, oh yeah, for sure
Wonder what they in it for
Take your last relationship
Look how good you treated him
You could birth like four of him
Girl, you never needed him
But they still need you
They still fuck with you
Anything you do
Anything you do
Everything's for you
Drama is for you
Take that L, you lose
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real (Woo!)
Places they say they've been, we actually going for real (Woo!)
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping (Woo!)
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy (Woo!)
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things (Huh!)
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real
I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, "Shake'n Bake" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her
Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin' (Stressin' over somethin')
You, you, you, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
Yeah, yeah
Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (A lifestyle)
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (Do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum

And I like to finish what you think you started
Man, you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him

Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me
Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (Lifestyle)
Ayy, yeah
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Yeah
Leaving me (leavin' me)
Dippin' out on me (on me)
Already got what you needed, I guess
Quickly (Quickly) learned yourself through me (Through me)
Already gave you what you needed, I guess (Ooh yeah)
I guess (Yeah) yeah
That's why I'm not with nobody (Ooh yeah)
Cause I don't wanna hurt nobody (Ooh yeah)
Did it over text, didn't call me (Ooh yeah)
Still got love for you, mami
I know you wanna be somebody
Even if you gotta leave somebody (Body) yeah
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (Jaded)
Most of these things I don't wanna say (Jaded)
I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (Dangerous, oh)
You got somethin' real, not basic (Ooh yeah)
You wanna get with me, stop
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (Jaded)
Most of these things, I don't wanna say (Say)
I wanna be around while you chasin'
(Wanna be around, wanna be around)
You wanna hit me up when you make it (Ooh, yeah)
You'll try and come back when you famous
(Back around, back around)
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (Dangerous)
You got somethin' real, not basic
You wanna get with me, stop (Flakin')
Yeah, dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Ayy, told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink in, you're gettin' under my skin
Pretty little young thing (Young thing)
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (Ooh yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (Jaded)
Most of these things I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
(Back around, back around, dangerous, oh, ooh yeah)
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
You wanna get with me, stop (Flakin')
Zaytoven
Lambo come alive, man, I'm used to this
No one looks surprised cause we used to this
I'ma make sure that we get used to this
Treat my brother's kids like they one of my kids
Never looking back on it, we did what we did
Could never find the time for the people I miss
Thought they had my back against the wall
Tell me that I don't deserve to ball
Well, then tell me who deserve it
Eyes getting low but I'm still observing, I see you lurking
Never see me out in person, I'm always working
Money on your head if you make a nigga nervous
Never made a move out here unless I was certain
Tatted on me, but this shit is deeper than the surface
I'm with everyone that I was here with in the first place
Making sure that they all good before they close the curtain
Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becomin the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life puttin on, you spend your whole life puttin up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'ma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for
I said, "Tell me what's really goin' on"
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone
Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when I’m gone
Miss me a little when I’m gone, gone, gone
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
Yeah
All you self-promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fuckin' game thankless
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha
No way out 'cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since "No Scrubs" and "No Pigeons"
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike"
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down
Especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that
No love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Y'all don't hear no songs
They hit my phone like, "You did that"
They even hit my line like, "Where you been at?"
It's always on some shit like
"When can I get a favor?" or, "Where my bitch at?"
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari
Look, now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist
Always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?"
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this
Yeah, I make you dance to this
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder
Sun shinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake
For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greezy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line
I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV
'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind
Yeah, and we can't stop
Make you dance to this, uh
I'ma make you One Dance to this
A-ha-ha-ha, ha
Bad breed, bad bwoy
Uh-huh, yeah
That's right, yeah
Yeah
Never thought I'd be talkin' from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I'll say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together (6)
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin' over Chattanooga, out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google, yeah
Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle, then take a girl to the movies
They been droppin' out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghostride
The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just makin' moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin'
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin'
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready case we need to retire your jersey, yeah
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championship celebrations durin' regular season
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Aw, nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to "Closer to My Dreams"
Wide-eyed and uneducated at nineteen
I can't rap like that, all young and naïve
Not after all the shit I seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
Four thousand square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I don't wanna see you end up with nothin'
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'
They knees give out and they passin' to you all of the sudden
Now you the one gettin' buckets
They put they arm around you, now you becomin' the crutches
Kids got on your number 'cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you
Or convince you that they care and see where it goes from there, but
These ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The hate is just bringin' me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie, then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep the shit to ourself
Papi champú, young Pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I
Was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I.
And Young Dro was poppin' off with "Ain't I"
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doin' macarena
But, who am I to complain now? I'm still around, they know
Yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Summer's mine
I swear I said it about a hundred times, I'ma need it back
Wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl, I needed that from you
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spendin' time just taking care of me right now
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
'Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long
But don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long
Pump, pump, pump it up (Skrrt)
She got a good head on her, but I pump it up (Skrrt)
I'm not a one hit wonder, they know all my stuff (Haan)
You let me turn into the nigga that you almost was
I done seen a lot of shit and I done been in things (Haan)
And I never started nothin', I just finish things
And I'm sell off like the man that brought me in this thing (Woo)
How you out here celebratin' like the winnin' team?
No, calm down, calm down
Shit ain't how you think it is, take a look around (Skrrt)
I'm supposed to be on a vacation right now
But I'm home wildin', word to DJ Khaled
Back with another one
I'm steady droppin' bombs on your head top (Haan)
Been that way since I could make your bed rock (Haan)
I'm on Bloor where you can't shop (Skrrt)
Bitch, I just rapped and it went pop
Next move better than my last move (Haan)
Your next move can't erase your past moves
Took her out once she got attached to him
Ring, ring, click, I'll get back to 'em (Woo)
You don't really want the views
You don't want a snapshot of things goin' on with the crew
You don't wanna hear Not Nice did thirteen
And did another two for some other shit he didn't do (Woo)
Last week, boy dem runnin' in the room (Haan)
This week sold one-point-two (Haan)
Yeah, it's a Boucheron, baby boy
Yeah, and I know Taraji like I'm baby boy (Haan)
And I fuck with Weezy and I'm Baby, boy (Haan)
Yeah, we the Army, better yet the Navy, boy (Haan)
Uh, baby, you wintertime cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women 'cause my aunt she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm jokin', I mean that thing is pokin'
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provokin'
I got bath water that you can soak in, things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, when lights comin' through the drapes and we both yawnin'
I roll over and ask if I can hit it in the mornin'
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, can I hit it in the mornin'?
Yeah, the Sun risin' while you moanin', baby
Can I hit it in the mornin', uh?
Can I hit it in the mornin', yeah?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
Rider shit
Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who"
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who," yeah
And she like, "Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life
Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' 'bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we're living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from, yeah
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma, yeah
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life
(Louder)
I got the game in a squeeze
Who disagree? I wanna see one of y'all run up a B
Yeah, two open seats, we flyin' at seven and packed for the beach
Yeah, keepin' it G, I told her, "Don't wear no 350s 'round me"
Iced out, no stylist
No Chanel, Nike track, doin' road with some waps
And that's Capo in the back, and that's swole in the back
Don't need Gucci on my back, TVGucci got my back
Don't know where y'all niggas at, I've been here, I've been back
In Delilah, word to Zack, I need action, that's a fact
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you—
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are
And I know all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
And I know all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are

(Might just have to go in on that)
Never fallin', why you makin' problems?
I've been silent, why you makin' problems?
I'm a problem, bein' rich is not my fault
You decide who you think the shit reside with
I been quiet, hard to miss me when I'm flyin'
Gone out to Caicos, she can stay in my room
She can stay in my room, and it ain't my
I was tryna play it right
I was tryna treat you nice
Funny how I had to stop
See me when I'm outside
We ain't have a problem
Then you went and found one
How you gonna get a bag?
She can't help but get attached
See me when you're outside
See me on the Southside
I could tell you're sick inside
'Cause she just wanna love me
She don't wanna leave me
She just wanna love me
She don't wanna leave me
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure (man, man)
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again (Six-six-six!)
Soon as you get in
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel
And don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care
Don't over-prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way
But, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
Doin' well, dog
Yeah, me and all my
Yeah, me—yeah
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog
How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you where you're from, where yo bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do know
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog
Oh, and I'm back, dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hitting like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Six-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it, then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the door's open, and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still—
Wow, all praise to the most high up...
It's over, it's over, yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I can't stay here no more, and I can't sleep on the floor
Man, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah, I'm leaving, yeah, I'm leaving, yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm gone, had to knock down the wall
Yeah, I swear to God that I'm gone, I'm leaving, I'm leaving
No looking back when I'm gone, no looking back when I'm gone
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more
It's over, it's over, yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I've been doing this wrong, I've been here for too long
I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid that I'ma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'ma be alone, I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road, I just gotta know the road
I just gotta hit the road, I just gotta know the road
I just gotta know the road
Something to say, then say that then
I just been out and bad from way back when
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
You got something to say, then say that then
I just been out and bad from way back when
I gotta get on the road, I gotta get on the road
I ain't looking back no more, no, no, no
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more
I gotta go out and get it, want you to know what I did
Want you to know how it went
That's why I keep telling you over and over again
Just let me go
Just let me go, let me bring it home to you
Just let me go, let me bring it home to you
Now and forever, I'll bring it home to you
Just let me go, let me bring it home
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home
Now and forever, I'll bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Now and forever, I'll bring it home
Now and forever, I'll bring it home
Uh, uh
Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either"
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Kane is in the building
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it and here I am
In the Presidential -- do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street, got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib, goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here, the drink here
The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no (say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine
We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Used to make us proud -- we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man
You keep talking that, "You was this and you had this"
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said, "you're such a dog", I said, "you're such a bone."
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, "show me some"
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no (say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Girl I know you wanna, you know I wanna
Yeah, she keep giving me looks
Hotter than the 6 in the summer, deadass, girl I wanna
Girl I know you wanna
You know I wanna
Yeah, she keep giving me looks
Yeah, girl I know you wanna
She's a spice, ride pipe like bike, like Yokohama
She heard the ting bend like banana
So she wanna give me the adunana-ne, ohh
She say I'm a sweeterman
But she say that she don't need a man
I say why don't we make an agreement then
We can just fuck while we're being friends
Girl, I know you wanna
You know I wanna
Girl, I know you wanna
You know I wanna
Shawty too fly though, that's all I know
She don't sing songs, but if I go strong she gon' hit this high note
She know she working with the nana
And she wanna give me the adunana-ne, ohh
She say I'm a sweeterman
But she say that she don't need a man
What if we make an agreement then
We can just fuck while we're being friends
Girl, I know you wanna
I know you wanna
Girl, I know you wanna
I know you want to girl
Ride the pipe like a bike, oh
Do the things you know I like, oh
I'm the man in my ends, oh
You're the one, let's not pretend
'Cause the pussy too good, drink too strong
Yiy too change, I'm too sprung, I, I, I
The pussy too good, drink too strong
Yiy too change, I'm so gone, I, I, I
Girl, I know you wanna

Girl, I know you wanna
I know you want to girl
Girl, I know you wanna

Girl, I know you wanna, I, I, I
Yeah
She keep giving me looks (oh-oh-oh)
She keep giving me looks (oh-oh-oh)
She keep giving me looks
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I need you right here beside me
If you oblige me, I'll hang it up, and I'll never come out of retirement
You should just sleep on it, you shouldn't doubt me
It would be different without me
What is it without me
Don't go do nothing without me
This is a blessing, mashallah, wallahi
I swear my life stories better than stories they tellin' 'bout me
They got it twisted
Ride the pipe like a bike, make sure you're going the distance
And if he wasn't with it, then why were you with him?
Maybe you just had to realize
That knowing the difference can make all the difference
She wanna run me that adanunana
Yeah she keep giving me looks
You don't really call on me like you should
Link up, I'll roll through the hood
Problems, but everything's all good, my love
Your nigga doesn't want smoke with me, nah, no way
Trust me, it's all okay, trust me, it's all
You just need some, someone that's calm and patient
Submission, domination
Arched back, deep stroke
White wine, weed smoke
That's my best combination
You just need some dick with no complications
You just need some, you just need some
Late night attention, uncondition
All that you're missing, my babe
Fucked up, shouldn't even have to justify
I get it, I'm on your side, guys get their way all the time
Besides, pleasure not meant for one side
You should just do what's best for your mind
How 'bout I just take my time?
You call up my line, I fall up inside you
Girls need love, too, I know
Look, I want you to myself
But I know you just left someone else, I know you did
He did a number on you (I know, brrrt)
That must be why you move so... icy
Icy like 1017
Icy like there's nobody you’d ever need
Better not give that up to anyone but me (yeah)
Patient as can be, but
I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything, somehow
I wanna see you do more in this life if we takin' it there (takin' it)
I want to see you do 911, fuck a Panamera (in a 911)
See you when I see the real thing, gettin' realer and realer (real)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But you icy like 1017 (icy)
Icy like there's nobody you'd ever need (icy, icy)
Better not give that up (better not give that up)
I'm here patient as can be, man
I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything somehow
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
OVO I ride, OMO I ride
Reps Up, them my niggas from the Scarborough side
Don’t fuck with them, or hollow tips will fly
I don’t have to lie
Lot of people say it in a song just to say it
Man, I’m not that type of guy, hit me on the cell
I just might bring you to the city
Send you home with stories you can never tell
I’m tryna break you out of your shell (And what?)
You just turned 21 like Adele, that’s good with me
I put my business on hold
Let me turn off the phone, let’s explore the unknown
If you not drinking with me, you force me to turn up alone
No peer pressure, I just know you like to get in your zone
You say that you’d rather smoke, well, let me call up OB’s room
And tell ‘em roll up a cone
I know he probably got that extra special (yup)
I never second guess it
How's Villanova? What classes you taking next semester?
Man, she like, "Fuck the small talk
I’m not here to discuss extra credits or my professors"
No time for funny stories
It’s funny how she shows up late, but always comes before me
We both young and misguided, but that’s another story, yeah
More rest and sex is all a nigga needs
In a lifetime of stress tryna put my mind at ease
I'm not lookin' at the phone, too much shit been goin' on
But while we got this moment of peace alone, girl
We should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
Girl, we should just get
Drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk and fuck, drunk
I hate when, I hate when people say they feel me man
I hate that shit
It’ll be a long time before y'all feel me, if ever
For real
You won’t feel me 'till everybody
Say they love you, but it’s not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fucking hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend's ass keep getting thicker than a plot does
And when you forget it, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit's right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It’s feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down, they just keep on
Saying that they feel you, nigga
You won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you’re in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503: some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
It start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga
I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
I’m driving right up to it now
Make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young niggas popping M’s and sipping dirty jones
Problem children that all be repping October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
I’m bout to fuck and I’m just praying that it feels good
I really don’t know much but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money more problems, my nigga don’t believe it
I mean, sure, there’s some bills and taxes I’m still evading
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches
Still scorching as if I didn’t notice
You niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda
I’m out here messing over the lives of these niggas
That couldn’t fuck with my freshman floater (flow ta)
Look at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it
My juniors and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga
(Wheel it!)
Yeah (Six!)
Yeah
Murda on tha beat so it's not nice
That’s Baka, he's a no-long-talker
Quick to let the motherfuckin' TEC slam
We don’t need to hear about a next man
Yutes talk down, then they get ran
Left them, get dipped from the whole ends
If Gilla call shots, no questions
G-Way til I'm restin'
But we still got love for the West End
If it's a chit-chat ting, better talk nice
Murda on the beat so it's not nice
Skull gets hot, then I'm not nice
You tryna date her and she been let me wop twice
Now you man are on a diss ting
Just know man like Chubbs
He's a fixer if I ever gotta fix tings
Just know man like Fif, he's a sickaz
You get tanned, he don’t miss things
Just know man like me, I’m a Sixer
And I oversee the whole thing
Yeah, I pree the whole thing (SN1)
Yeah, I pree the whole thing
Preme got the err tucked, can't see the whole thing
Niggas wanna talk splits, now we need the whole thing
Ha, yeah
They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, "Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?"
They said, "Fucking right, they were the first to go"
It's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With "I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you"
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, "Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?"
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say "What up, though?"
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
Uh, I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: "Nobody's workin' as hard as you"
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin' hard in his yellow goose - yeah!
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
Yeah, and I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Ay Guru tell, tell homegirl to open that Ace right there...)
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go
Too rich for who? Y'all just got rich again
Who grips the mic and likes to kill they friends?
I've never been the type to make amends
If shit was at a eight, we like to, we like to, we like to—
Yeah, if shit was at a eight, we like to make it ten
1da sent this in, I'm goin' up all the way
I don't like to talk when there's nothin' else left to say (True)
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your sister is pressin' play, your trainer is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— (True)
I gotta breathe real deep when I catch an attitude
I got a whole 'nother level that I can tap into
Max said they only blessed when they attached to you
The only deadbeats is whatever beats I been rappin' to (True)
And the product is still the best though
It's only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the estate man, I had to Copperfield like presto
Voilà, tada (True)
Never a matter of "could I?" or "should I?"
Kiss my son on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—
Miss makin' 'em pay
Helipad from Will Smith crib straight to the stage
Three Forum shows but I played Staples today
The neighborhood is smokey, y'all stay safe in this place (True)
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your niggas is pressin' play, your nanny is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— (True)
Had to go and hit reset, now we here
I been on top for three sets of three years
I can't be around the niggas you minglin' with
I can't fly if I could sit on the wing of that shit (True)
I try to pay it less mind
They been keepin' tabs on me like I'm payin' next time
I think I sense a little fear from the other side
White vans parked across the street, real subtle guys (True)
Yeah, never a matter of "could I?" or "should I?"
Kiss my mom on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—
Woah, woah
Yeah
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby

Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby

Me and my friends, me and my friends, we got money to spend
Yeah, woo
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time gets to tickin' and it takes a toll
Told you I couldn't really draw the line
Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things
Things that you could've kept inside
Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time, it done left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin' my business and you show up
Up to no good, I should've seen the signs
Signin' me up to do your dirty work
Workin' to try and get you off my mind
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya
Ayy, elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
(Yeah, yeah)
If you need me, you can call me, I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind, all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (Bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (Wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne (Haan) when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes
When I was with Ms. Creighton, that lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favourites, it feels amazin' (Yeah)
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid we can never separate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me, I begin to write the thesis
Franny got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marineland, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer, I'ma be tweakin'
Yeah, Link Up TV, Behind Barz
Big up man like Rashid, Joey, Tadas, yeah
Shoutout Giggs for settin' the ting
SN1, OVO
Mm-hmm, yeah, look
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
Staying in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get rushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust
Yeah, yeah
Big Scorpion, out now
Yeah, look
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
Think you know me? That's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck about jeans and crep
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like goin' tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that
Yeah, Link Up TV
Drizzy Drake
Maddas, jheeze!

On my plate, lookin' up
Outer space, Pearly Gates
I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change up
Reporting live from the gutter
I will buy this motherfucker, it's not even a discussion, woo
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah
She gon' end up dippin' with me, yeah, yeah

Pillow talking, dishing out on all y'all, yeah
In one ear and out the other

Live from the gutter, dawg, yeah, yeah
She don't want pets, but I'm a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it, dawg, yeah, yeah
And she love it, dawg, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit
Soon as night fall, that's when we lock in
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dawgs that go Karrueche with the chopsticks, woo
And we gon' miss you
They don't want no smoke, they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta live through
But these the times we gotta live through, and I'm
Yeah
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake dawg, this the shit you need God for
How long do you think it's gon' take for y'all to fall
That's a serious question because I seriously question all of y'all
Been touring the world man, I've done spent racks in all the malls
And they know my story, flaws and all
I still got plaques hanging wall to wall dawg
She just offered a strip tease, but she don't look like Demi Moore
Hips all on 45, waist all on 24
And it's all love in the city, still scream XO, when that Henny pour
But I'm that boy, not just any boy, what the fuck you think that I'm in it for
Roll up in that thing, got hoes like Prince, but they know I'm king
Chubbs might hold that thing, if he get caught, he'll be home by spring
Things I shouldn't share, I mean for the sake of my career
I'm not tryna stunt, I'm just tellin' you the truth, I swear
This the shit that I live for with the people I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake dawg, this the shit you need God for
This that shit we really gotta talk about in person
There's some shit I need to work on, but I know you see me working
Nigga, champagne...
Uh, yeah
I heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah, you know word of mouth
The square root of 69 is 8 somethin', right?
'Cause I've been tryna work it out, oh
Uh, good weed, white wine
Uh, I come alive in the night time, yeah
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio
Let it play
Say you gotta leave, but I know you wanna stay
You just waitin' on the traffic jam to finish girl
The things that we could do in twenty minutes girl
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
It's gettin' hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go the text that I write is gon' say
DJ Paul
TWhy
Ayy, ayy
Lot of 6's in here tonight
Yeah, yeah, ayy
(Dopeman!)
Ten of us, we movin' as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (Yeah)
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that
If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent
I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old
I promise I'm bridgin' the gap
Woo! You know what I'm sayin'?
Woo! Ayy, ayy
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Gyeah, gyeah, gyeah, gyeah!)
Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'

Can't afford no mistakes
Everything just in case
Billboard where I play
They welcome me, I overstay
I'm a huncho, I'm the boss
My set takin' off
Polo used to be Lacoste
Water used to be the tap, nigga, not the Voss
Damn, things changed (Changed)
I'm so awake (Woke)
You take the bait (Bait)
You get replaced
You do the math, nigga
On 88 dates (Cash)
The take-home was crazy
I take home your baby, yeah!
At 23 I bought it all, just to make sure, yeah, yeah!
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)
I been waitin' on this
Yeah
All of this disorder, no addressin'
The crown is broken in pieces, but there's more in my possession
There's a whole lot in my possession
Who do you really love? Well, that's sure to be in question
My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a—
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the GOAT and talked about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it
Niggas gamblin' with they life for some content
That's the type of lottery that could get your top picked
I am a cream-of-the-crop nigga
You niggas pop mollies, my 'Malis pop niggas
House on both coasts, but I live on the charts
I have tea with the stars and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked, there's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to— Man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
RIP my niggas that they caught without it
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
I ain't even have to cut the tie, it severed itself
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
Yeah, she said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007, I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!" (Go off)
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin' (Go off)
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
I'ma just hand her a business card and say "Nigga we made it!"
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"
Yeah, if they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it
If I said it, I meant it, there's no way around it
OVO, Reps Up, and P. Reign is next up, watch Gway go crazy
When Baka came home for the holidays, I was like "Nigga we made it!"
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it (Go off)
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience (Go off)
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it
I would just look at you dead in yo' face and say "Nigga we made it!"
I swear that we made it, selloff that ting, I'm the king in Jamaica
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell ya, I don't need no favors (Go off)
(Damn, Soulja Boy stunt on them haters)
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'
I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like "Nigga we made it!"
Uh, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's The Boy but I'm still the man, come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands, then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17
Want a lot, can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything
Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn
Can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything
Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
That's when the phone starts ringin' like, "Are we straight?"
Two-faced niggas back around with the three face
Damn, ol' triple double, Russ face, watch with the bust face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up is scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Ayy
UberX to Hidden Hills
Give me somethin' I can feel
If they come to Hidden Hills
Then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road
You could hit it with a stone
I be out here on my own
I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town
'Til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate
Gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Yeah, yeah
Back and forth to Italy
My comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate
Y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys, we crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm– I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel
I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin' what they say
Especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke
Here we go, yeah
Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like "Billie Jean", but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time
And all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothin' like the new times
Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines
Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breakin' my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry 'bout whose house you live at
Or who loves you more or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Nah, look, I'm too proud
To let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know
I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time he's a stand up
And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony's sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more
Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin' each other down
God willin', I got a good feelin'
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this my G
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man

Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from

My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele

I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves
Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese, you don't want drama, capisc'?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlamagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me, it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

I was like, "Nah, nigga, let's get it"

Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me

Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical

My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass

We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah

And fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Aw, yeah
I think you're changing your mind
Starting to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise
And now, I'd rather know ahead of time
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done
Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see
You liking someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusin' me
Don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl
Summer just started, and we're already done
I kept it decent
I kept you sane, I kept it peaceful, don't lie

Even the secrets, kept it between you and I
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea

You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl
Summer just started, and we're already done
Uh, you getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you're the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together, uh
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands (Yeah)
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
(Come on) Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
(Come on) Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my LA girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
(Come on) Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my TO girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends (Yeah)
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done, hair done—nails done, hair done
Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Showtime)
Go, go, go, go, go (As we proceed)
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it
Yeah
Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
"Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?"
(June, you're a genius)
I said, "I respect it, no problem"
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real
Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you mad at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
There when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, "Damn, coach, put him in"
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when
Yeah
For real
Facts, you know what I'm sayin'?
Hahaha, yeah
K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Ayy, yeah
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
(Run that back, Turbo)
Yeah, ayy, look
I bring up money, they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
She gave me her number, now I gotta block it
I'm mixin' the dirty bills in with the profit
Clean that shit up and I give it right back to him
If I don't fuck with him, then I can't rap with him
I wanna be there when somebody catches him
I want a witness to see that shit
Man, these folks, these folks gotta goddamn hear this shit, no cap
I bring up hits and they change up the topic
I got a 19 and it fold in my pocket
One hell of a year and a nigga still droppin'
They wanted to stop it, but they couldn't stop it
You told a story like shorty was feelin' you
She told a story like she split the bill with you
Look at my story, man, no one could write it
Now I see a million, I don't get excited
I might just YSL my shit, the Thugger way
Ain't no real sense in me goin' the other way
Cannot be seen in that shit from the other day
Virgil just chef'd me a whole different colorway
Please don't be stupid, it's Baby and Gunna
And Baby, he wanted her, so I just swung her
Next time I'm in Dallas, I'll look for another
You niggas fell off and you'll never recover
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Tay Keith, this too hard
Ring, ring, ring, we drip too hard, ayy
(Run that back, Turbo)
You seen the overseas drip?
D. Hill (D. Hill)
Ayy
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you (Ayy)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know
'Cause you got desires
Ayy
Self-control has never been your thing
Don't think it'll help if there's a ring with a rock in it
Where I'm from, they serve the soda clean (Clean, clean)
You come from a city where there's lean with the rocks in it
How the fuck you keep so many secrets?
How you goin' vegan, but still beefin' with me again?
How the fuck you've seen so many beaches?
Tickets to them places don't come cheap, and
I see you back in Turks
Remember who took you there first and don't you forget it
Got you a whip, but then you got back on your shit
I had to tell Eric go get it
I'm always movin' too fast, the feeling don't last
I feel like you take me for granted
Probably my fault for the way that I handle it
I should've put you somewhere where no one could find you (Ayy)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires
Ooh, shawty, you tried it
Voice gettin' filled with entitlement
Why would you tell me those lies? And
Why would you make it so bold to my face?
Why are your stories all over the place?
Whole lotta secrets friends don't keep safe
Where did your friends all go? (Woo)
I can't solve your problems
You say your problems never needed solvin'
I was too good to you, should've stayed solid
Nice guys always finish off where they started
Déjà vu, you wanted things and you got 'em
Déjà vu, I wanted smoke and I got it
Déjà vu, déjà
Déjà
Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
They ain't even got on the road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here tellin' everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing
Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came -
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it

You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back
Bitches callin' my phone like I'm locked up, nonstop

That shit platinum just like all of my releases, my girl
Niggas come for me, I tear them all to pieces, my girl

I'm a popstar, not a doctor, watch her
Say she rep a whole different block, so I blocked her
Busy at the crib, cookin' salmon with the lobster
If we talkin' joints, it's just me and David Foster
Bodyguards don't look like Kevin Costner, you tweakin'
Just pulled up to Whitney Houston, Texas for the evenin'
They tell the same story so much, they start to believe it
The ones that start like, "Drizzy's shit was cool, but we even"
Man, how the fuck?
Two, four, six, eight watches, factory, so they appreciate
Crown in my hand and I'm really playin' keep-away

26 on my third GQ cover
Your new shit sound like you do covers
Of all of my old shit, oh shit
I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they winning
On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three-month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga
Your money is just a little Barney’s Co-Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best MC
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
I Comedy Central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both, nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
That five star in your city, they know where we at
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga
You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend
Six months since I've been back in the Six
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been, babe
If anybody know
I know
Yeah
Get a plastic bag

Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
Aw yeah, Magic City on a Monday
Esco treat that shit like church on Sunday
Niggas look at us like, "Maybe one day"
Maybe one day, maybe one day
But for now, a nigga got the ones with me
I be in the club with the bands like I got the keyboard and the drums with me
Maybe one day, maybe one day
You'll understand how I get it, though
Man, it's everything I ever said it is
Mixin' liquor cups with the sedatives
I roll up with the bands on me
This a good night to dance on me
This a good night to dance on me
This a good night to dance on me, yeah
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it

You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying
God knows it
Pure mind and pure soul I possess, He knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get broken
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying
People change, I'm not surprised
Devil's working overtime
Voodoo spells put on my life
It won't work, they all have tried
I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time
I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying
You put food on the table for me, aye?
Alright, fam, soft. I see you, aye?
You pay my bills, right?
It's light
You're a wasteman
Top story
Wah?
Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I-I-I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying "you should quit", cars saying "fuck your life"
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches (yeah)
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I just take the dreams I've been sold
And sell 'em for more, you already know
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I still have my guard up
Blame this thing I'm part of
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin' the time to clear my mind
'Cause soon as I'm able to let that go
Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like, fo real
This life shit is everywhere, you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
You, you, you
Make me wanna take you down through there
Make me wanna take you down through there
I'll take it there
Why you never come to where I stay?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl, you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it?—this isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things
That don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time
And sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man
Me and you are playing house
Start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on you now
Maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home
I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women
'Cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home
I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6
And you don't ever come to where I stay at
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man
Hunnid 4 times how it go down
Slaps on deck for the Oaktown
On mamas, man I did it with my own sound
And I got my own city that I hold down
Just admit it already
You got plans to do it, but we did it already
Got a couple DMs I done slid in already
Gotta ask YG if he hit it already, yeah
I'm a star like Moesha's nigga
Runnin' up the numbers like Ayesha's nigga
Yeah, I be slidin', I be creepin', nigga
Girls these days, they just don't know how to keep a nigga
But I got it all handled
They try to box me in, I got my own angles, yeah
I'ma spend the summer gettin' to the cake
And I'ma wish a nigga would on every candle
I'm like...
Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is "Where the rest of my commas?"
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, "How Does It Feel?"
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?
Yeah, they try to send for me
Envy and jealousy is everything I wish upon my enemies
All that for them, right back at them
What my mind keeps telling me
Mind keeps telling me
I hear everything, I don't ask if it's all there cause it better be
Trust me it better be, no long talking or settling
Jizzzle never won no wrestling
But he's on a big bell metal ting
Streets unruly
More life for my brother's tryna better things, cause...
Free shmoke
Anybody want it, they can get it, no joke
Call up Landlord, nigga that's bro
I only link with the real ones, lord knows
On fo'
I love to see a fake nigga go broke
I don't run to Twitter with the things I know
I fall back just to see how it unfolds
Yeah, like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Like whoa
Years ago, they didn't wanna know
But now I'm seeing dough
Catties they be calling up my phone
Trying to get tickets to a show
Yeah, I got U.K. tings on the WhatsApp now
Like +44 on the code
Yeah
I'm home now, it's over now, so...
Yeah
She got a thing for Chanel vintage that dropped before she could speak English
Do you love me or love seekin' attention, I mean which one is it?
You keep callin' me ya twin, but twins ain't this different
Mentally I'm already on next year, that's some 20/20 clear vision
You sayin' let you finish, I ain't tryna hear it
I'm all for spiritual liftin', but I don't fly Spirit
I'm all for findin' happiness, but down to die serious
All smiles, Kevin Durant trials
Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli'
I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles
I know they love to rock a check, but who gon' do it really? Really?
My depositions never surface
Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, it's gettin' purchased
Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses
Paid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase
Trust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on
Tales about me are like corridos in Culiacán
Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star
Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards
Vision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours
Still a part of shorty even if we've been livin' apart
Roxx'll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod
Meanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God
Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed
The one that's rebuildin' schools and feedin' the homeless
Hang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it
'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed
Goals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world
"I gotta get the most of everything" is the axis on which it sit and twirls
Point blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, it's too late
This different right here, yo
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Jheeze, yeah
Right, look, look
Tell me how you really feel
Tell me how you really feel
I would ask you what's the deal
But y'all don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Couldn't make a greatest hits
Y'all a whole lot of things
But you still ain't this
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard you never claimed the hood
Heard the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Oh well, ship sailed
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big
That they try to hit me with boat fines
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin', yeah
Just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lotta sides on the same side
OVO, we a gold mine
But I'm goin' gold, no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city goin' crazy
Whole city goin' crazy
Top five, no debatin'
Top five, top five, top five
And the whole city rate me
And I'm back inside The Matrix
And I said that we would make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no met-along-the-way shit
We done really put some days in
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
Uh, say baby, I had to mention
That if you were a star, you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like they're in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Tryna take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to, put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures
Shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on youKi-Killa, Killa
And together, we shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice (They'd know)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
They know we'd shut it down
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
Every time we come around (Aye) round (Aye) round (Aye)
(And they're on it) And they'd notice (They'd know) they'd notice
They'd know you shut it down
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets (Yes indeed)
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl, who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—
The way I’m feeling, the things I say
All just happen, when you pass my way
What can I do, to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl, I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not tryna say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed, and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take them fucking heels off, it’s worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me
Lay you down, down, down
I’m tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
They'd notice, they'd notice
Let me lay you down, down, down
Tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it
Drizzy
Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2"
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the:
Alright well, um, alright. We... we'll fuckin' figure it out. You know what you—you know what you're doin' with it, you know, makin' it to the top. All the way to the top. Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin'?
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin' water, steady tryna swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me "Shoppin' Bag Drizzy"
Or call me Mr. "Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?"
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy
I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want is the...
Yeah, it's like I, it's like I know what I gotta say
I just don't know... how to say it... to you
Me and my niggas bucking head first
You supposed to be there when my head hurt
Used to be going out hardly, now we wanna party
Celebration on me, well what's up
Pay homage, I roll through the city like young Sheikh Mohammed
It can't be that hard to find us
Go to Jungle, pick up my Ethiopian goddess
That's when words spread, a Bugatti is in the projects
The boy home, used to take the bus to the block
Now summertime whips come through and bust up the block
I remember seeing Nikk's having to bust up a block
And sell the work right to hush, y'all niggas must have forgot
But I was there Nas don shit, a couple things sit on my conscience
With that said, look at all we accomplished
Yea, sure this ain't Compton but this ain't a fairytale land neither
We all lost mad people, the city wild
They gave the task to a purposeful child
Verses start to get a little more personal now
But that’s cause everybody else sound is so played out though
Oliver North in the cut Dolce'd out though
A thousand dollar bottle it get poured straight out though
I'm screaming OVO on the whole way out though
I'm back boy for real, I'm that boy for real
I got hits nigga, you just a batboy for real
Backwoods get peeled, I smoke away all the tears
Nothing was the same man, including y'all careers
The new Cash Money, the new Roc-A-Fella
Bunch of young rich niggas, turn around if you jealous
Would've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know, oh-oh-oh
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, what's up with ya?
I hate calling the women "bitches," but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember?
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back, I
Would've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back
One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch
Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it
And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'ma sip this drank until that muhfucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on
I don't give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight, I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow
But I do it to her
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end
Ayy, yeah
I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation, you know
I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 PM and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like, like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone
Treat you like princess
Rest in heaven, Diana
Piquing my interest
She got peak like Montana
England breeds proper girls
Where are all your good manners?
Reply with pleasantries
Honestly, I can't stand ya
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
What you thought of me?
Never had me missin' a beat
That's just a view from a cheap seat
They don't want problems with me
Talk used to be cheap; nowadays, it's free
People are only as tough as their phone allows them to be
Girl, that could never be me
I found my peace, I'm about to say my piece
You might not agree with me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, you gon' make me turn up on you
Go outside, big time forward, heh
Starboy dey here suh
Too mix up in drama to go outside
Too mix up in drama to free my mind
Jealous people around me, I need to change my life
I just turn colder every time I try
What would I do without you, my chargie?
I don't feel that way with anybody
Tell me your secrets, I'm not messy
Steady it for me, girl, hold steady
I wanna put you in my life
Your hair smell like the tropics, your body look nice
One fuck cyaan hold me, we gotta go twice
I'm here for you, just tell me what you like
I wanna put you in my life
Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I-I- I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty here I go
Should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget? My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
"It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!"
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"
Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on
I don't really want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit "redial", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just having the time of our lives right now
What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I started treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over
All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
What are we even doing?
Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
'Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "You don't how good it is to be you 'cause you're him"
And I say "Well, goddamn"
Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
In the whip solo
No one's gotta know (After dark)
Knockin' at your door
I don't gotta work anymore (After dark)
You can
Put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands (After dark)
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark
Late night like Left Eye, I'm creepin'
Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changin'
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way (After dark)
In the whip solo, no one's gotta know
(No one's gotta know) after dark
Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore
(I don't gotta work no more) after dark
You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah) after dark
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark
In the whip solo, no one's gotta know
(No one's gotta know) after dark
Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore
(I don't gotta work no more) after dark
You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah) after dark
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark
Reps Up, OVO, you already
All my niggas so hungry, man they just eat what they kill
I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills
I might tell the whole crew come through
My squad gotta roll through come through
Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'
Because they sure do come true
Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit, this that fuckin' player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit
And like you just got traded, girl you don't know who you're playin' with
Aw yeah, aw yeah, and my sound is what up right now
I've been down but I'm up right now
Nigga been backstrokin' and breaststrokin'
Through that lane that you left open, man I don't give a fuck right now
Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low
'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla at me
Yeah, I got two tings comin' through
And they do whatever I want 'em to
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin' up for real
I used to drive the Acura to school
Now I don't touch the wheel unless it's new
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin up for real
No Money Manziel, the game is at a stand still
How am I the man still? How am I the man still?
I, I might, I might call up Pam still
Tell em bring a can still, brrt brrt brrt!
Still, tell them bring the rider, get my roll on
Big Tymer ting, go get your roll on
Tell them basic bitches they can hold on
I'm at the Hazey in the lobby with my robe on
Bring you to Habibiz, get your smoke on
I been going Hamilton for so long, yeah
This ain't a joke ting, I want the whole thing
I want my new ting, to meet my old ting
Let them get well acquainted, let them get hella faded
I'm halfway through the race and I'm already celebrating
I'm on that Y shit, I'm back on my shit
I ran the game so long I should be wearing Dri-FIT
Oh yeah I'm poppin' again
And it kills me to yell out free Baka again
But free Baka again, and free Greezy one time
Shout out Sammy and Peezy one time, you know what it is
She's like "TOPSZN, is that a bad thing?"
I'm like "I don't know, are you a bad ting?"
Yeah, I got two tings comin' through
And they do whatever I want 'em to
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin' up for real
I used to drive the Acura to school
Now I don't touch the wheel unless it's new
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin up for real
Yeah, I got two tings comin' through
And they do whatever I want 'em to
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin' up for real
I used to drive the Acura to school
Now I don't touch the wheel unless it's new
Yeah, we call that schemin' up
We call that schemin' up, we call that schemin up for real
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
We call that schemin' up for real
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
We call that schemin' up for real
Yeah, I never really
Talk about dick that I wanna give you or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, hair grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like, like Evil Angel, like Vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kai's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hittin' (Kshh!)
Soothin', keep it right there, no movin'
Make my way around the bases-es
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (Hi)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willin' and ready for the takin'
Earth-shatterin', groundbreakin'
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now, we’re one now
Did somebody…
Who'd they say that baby look like?
Drake!
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixin' potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it (Woo woo, woo woo)
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it (Woo woo, woo woo)
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixin' potion
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it, yeah
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Yeah
I got a new vision for all my shit (for all my)
I don’t know what to call that shit (don’t know what to call it)
I know, I’m selling all of my cars
I’m selling all of my watches
I’m selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don’t need that shit (don’t need it)
I’m a different breed with this shit (yeah)
I’m tryna turn M’s to B’s in this bitch (yeah)
And I ain’t ever pay to be with no bitch (woo!)
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed
Fifty mill' in one room (huh?)
You, you could ask anyone out here who running the game?
And they’ll tell you the truth, man, they tell you (and they tell you)
Oh look, they fuck with me now (hey)
I think they’re hearin' me now (yeah)
Someone said, "Nigga, they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like, "I think they just might be scared of me now" (might be scared of me now)
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day (every day), niggas wrong every day (true)
Gone, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe (nope)
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka, that’s grindin'
Twap, twap!
Twap, twap!
In the new house, we got the twap
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, "I guess it does" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah
Uh, yeah, this what yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money
ATF
Thank me later in this bitch wasssup
Free Weezy in this bitch wasup
June 15th in this bitch wasup
Noel That’s it Ahhhhhh
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me
Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah
Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way
Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who don't have your heart in your rap shit
And got too fuckin' comfy
'Cause we still fuckin' hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin' faded, aw yeah I'm fuckin' faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aw yeah, I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin' all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out
I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Jodeci "Cry For You"
Do things when you want me to
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla
Yeah, okay, you like it
When I get, aggressive, tell you to
Go slower, go faster
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla
And I’m never on a waste ting shorty
I do it how you say you want it
Them girls, they just wanna take my money
They don't want me to give you nothing
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'
They don't wanna see me
Smiling back when they pree
Knowing I'd lie for you
Thinking I'd die for you
Jodeci "Cry For You"
Do things when you want me too
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla
I think I'd lie for you
Thinking I'd die for you
Jodeci "Cry For You"
Do things when you want me too
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla
I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Jodeci "Cry For You"
Do things when you want me too
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controlla
Yeah, I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Still with the dawgs that I grew beside
All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
I'm outside in an AMG, yeah
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
I just caught a shawty off a finsta
Just threw on a hoodie, it's a Crenshaw
Way that I been livin' unconventional
I'm just tryna make it to the end, ya know
Certain things just started gettin' tenser
Think we need to have us an adventure
I could be your man but maybe down the road
Right now I would rather see my heart turn to chrome
Rather see my heart turn crystal
I can't even front like I don't miss ya
Right now I'm just stuck inside the crib on my own
Soon as I free up, I'm 'bout to pop up on your phone like
I'm outside in an AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah
Who am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
Yeah
Heart's still on javelin, baby
Too turnt, baby girl, you know me
I was pullin' off 'fore they knew me
Sometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me
When it was you and me
I felt like I love you too much to change you
You believe in angles more than angels
Feel like I've been going through too much to explain to you
But I'm still the same way I was when I came to you
Everything I have, what I had to exchange for you
Everything I've been through, I can't even complain to you
Wish it stayed the same for you, sorry
I'm sorry
And-and-and-and—
I'm outside in a—
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm— (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—)
I'm outside in a—
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm— (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—)
I'm outside in a—
And-and-and-and I'm outside in a—
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm— (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—)
I'm outside in a—
Woi-oi, woi-oi-woi-oi-woi-oi-woi-oi-woi-oi
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who would have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up this scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
That's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
Shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up
Soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full
But you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game
In which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position
You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now
Fuck y'all niggas on, man?
Duffle bag forever
Just left V Live
Atlanta could never die as long as Tit alive
Yeah
Look, I got a big amount
I think I'm the biggest out
Got hits and I ain't even put 'em out
Lit and you can't even put it out
Got the Billboard melodies
Rap is somethin' I do on the side
Crossed over to the other side
And I didn't even have to die
Got the money and I never show it
Let a nigga try to play heroic
Michael Jackson talkin' to me in my dreams
And he say, "You bad and you know it"
Better shamone with my check then
I'm a J. Prince investment
Niggas love to talk reckless
Then see me like best friends
Got the sand-colored FN
And I've never seen the inside of a Marriott or a Westin
Five stars, nothin' less than
Fuck niggas on your payroll
And you let 'em know the safe code
And you knew him for a month though
But you call them niggas big bro
You could move in the Hidden Hills
And we still don't live by the same code
I'm respected everywhere I go
Nigga, long live Bankroll
Skip the rainbow, funny style shit
And it's straight to the pot of gold
Somebody, everybody know
6 God with the god flow
Yeah, yeah
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, "Damn, Drake fly"
And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em"
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, "'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill"
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they ain't never real
Yeah, that's all I can say
Tell a bad bitch "Girl, let's go hang"
You know me, Rolex, gold chain
Fuck with my young niggas, XO Gang
Get so drunk you forget your name
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches
Voodoo Child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back so I'm all in with these new flows
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows and Screw flows, my shit is sounding like grey tapes
Now, let me gon' hit that cup, one time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast, so give me anything to make shit go slow
Yeah, money in my safe but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change but I don't really see no change in us, oh, no
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up in some old shit to drivers opening doors
This is my town, if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I just give everybody a piece of this and make do with what's left
Yeah, I do this shit to the death, yeah, I do this shit til I'm gone
Yeah, I told you it's our world, you foolish thinking I'm wrong, ooh
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let these niggas know it's real
What's up?
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?
It's your fuckin' birthday (Oh, birthday, I need more liquor)
It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh oh
It's your birthday, baby, it's your birthday
Yeah, who's gonna love you on your worst day?
You talk so tough
I know you're soft like buttercups
Reese's, Reese's, don't be ridiculous
Just say your piece and peace up like Ibiza
Cool your headtop, you hotter than Anitta
Bakin', baby, tell me where I need to–
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday
It's your brrrrrrr–
It's your fuckin' birthday (Oh, birthday, I need more liquor)
It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control (Oh oh)
It's a celebration, oh oh
They tried it, they went for it
All year and you're still here, just ignore it
If it ain't the real thing, you don't want it
GG, CC's all on ya
It's your month and you know it (And you know it)
And you know it's real, don't gotta say it for you
And you know somebody home prayin' for you
You say, "Play this shit," they better play it (Ayy, play it)
For you (For you), on time
And I miss the days that you was all mine
Haven't been official in a long time
So tell me where I need to–
To be, to feel, and fill that emptiness inside you
Petty bullshit shouldn't excite you
On your birthday
It's your brrrrrrr–
It's your fuckin' birthday (Oh, birthday, I need more liquor)
It's a fuckin' celebration (Oh oh)
Tonight we celebrate
Seems like time's out of our control
It's a celebration, oh oh
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody actin' like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke, "I'm out in Miami, too"
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fuckin' with her, I don't really need her, aw
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Yeah, Dedication 6, of course
Shout out Guru for sendin' me the beat, too
Young Angel, Young Lion
More Life, no dyin'
Yeah, alright, I got it, yeah
Super Bowl goals, I'm at the crib with Puff
He got Kaepernick on the phone, he in a whole different mode
Angel hair at 2AM for Bey and Hov
Just to show 'em how I treat the city like my humble abode
Ayy, tell me if TD Bank is approvin' loans
I'm thinkin' of payin' Wayne what Universal owes
My nigga spent a lifetime goin' platinum and gold
He should own half of the label, shit outta control
Somebody get Larry Jackson on the phone
I need some ownership if we pressin' go
'Cause business is boomin' on behalf of me
I need a bite outta the Apple like Adam and Eve
We gon' have to break the billi' curse
I need my paper long like "A Milli" verse
Or too long like a sentence from a Philly judge
Fuck is the point in all the beefin' when we really blood?
Nobody wins when the family feuds, nigga
Everybody gotta eat, we can't exclude niggas
I make the crib, expandin' pools and expandin' rooms
Addin' Hammam Spas with tannin' booths, nigga
That's truth, no boost, nigga
But this isn't all about callin' truce
I'm still dishin' out verbal abuse
That shit could get re-introduced
If somebody got somethin' they urgin' to prove, nigga
Inspirin' to the youth
New Years Eve, lookin' like a royal flush
Wait, we all in the same suit
I'm Hall of Fame in the booth, nigga
My karma makin' the news, nigga
This pudding taste like the proof, nigga
If I ever see Trump, he better salute niggas
Much as we do, nigga, for real
This is why I do this shit
I think they call this "venting"
Look, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'ma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles 'cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everything
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
Camo shorts and Bubba Kush
We can talk she'd rather fuss
This and that 'bout such and such
Damn, where is the fucking trust
I'm tired of the hoop and hollering
I'm 'bout to take the coupe to Collins
Then take a female to the Island
Then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah, now she hear I'm with them other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fucking business
Shit she probably out here fucking niggas
I'm fucking her friends
Now her friends ain't even fucking with her
Damn, she text me all day and night
So pissed off she ain't even spelling shit right
I text her back, and tell her it's life
Now somebody tell them hoes, I'm single for the night
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight
Dreads braided to the back
I'm chilling but my swag on full attack
And my girl acting like a brat
So when she call, I don't answer, I just write her back
She hate it when I do that shit
And when I get home she go through my shit
She call numbers back to see who that is
Man I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, Polo drawers
Now make me take this Polo off
Girl you can get broken off
Yeah, I fuck you for an hour then I smoke it off
Swimming trunks and bathing suits
Then go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight
Man somebody tell them hoes I'm single for the night
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight
Now she got on her fuck 'em dress
And I got on my double-breast
And he been fussing all day with her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be Weezy F Baby-sitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up
She say she just playing
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's about to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard, both times
We both say we single, and we both lying
We both wrong, but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight
If you're single, put your hands up
If you're single, put your hands up
If you're single, put your-
If you're single tonight
If you're single, put your hands up
If you're single, put your hands up
If you're single
If you're single tonight
I'm more than just an option (Hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (Hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart (Hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it taking over
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I'm more than just a number (Hey, hey, hey)
I doubt you'll find another (Hey, hey, hey)
So every single summer (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll be the one that you'll remember and—
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
It's more than just a mission (Hey, hey, hey)
You hear, but you don't listen (Hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention (Hey, hey, hey)
And get what you've been missing
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
Tha Biz—Tha Bizness
She be jumpin' up and down, tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they wanna talk about is partying and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashing 'em all
Young Money, man, this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please, bring your finest
And what are all your names again? We drunk, remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like I am? Les-be-honest!
She wants me, she wants me
'Cause I got it all, shawty, tell me what you don't see
I will fuck with all y'all, all of y'all are beautiful
I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosing hoes
And Wayne say, "Pussy, pussy, pussy"
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all, damn
And every time I think of staying with her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider
And then...
Went from my nigga serving it by the tele to venues in Manchester
Just swerving with Balotelli the fuck are you trying to tell me?
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shit's embarrassing
They even bring up these niggas make a comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas got to be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became something
Girls that becoming ladies, and my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city, this shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This is shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know
Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin' on a star when I was that
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in
Burnin' incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?
I'll be better off without you, and we know that
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back
You put me on the road without a roadmap
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
You got some liquor at the house?
Yeah
Go get a shot, let's do a shot together
I don't see it
Okay, hahaha
Ayy
Being here wasn't in the plans
I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam
I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am
Even when being real is out of fashion
Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like it's home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
It could've went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why
It was always you and I without the T-Y
This is not one of them stories that got three sides
This is not one of them stories you could rewind
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts
Yes, sir
(Baby)
Hold on, hold on
(Let me tell you something about me)
(I really do know, I know who I wanna be)
Woo
Lord, I already passed on all that (Woo)
You go 'head on, haha
J–j–j–just in my zone, I close my figures up
All your hoes chose me, nigga, calm down
Louis pouch across my body, this is not for fashion
This is not a playground – ain't no fist fight, bitch, I'm blastin'
Niggas say they lookin' for me like I'm not right here, man
If I tatted tears, I'd be cryin' to my beard, man
Bitch, I'm tryna fuck, I've been inside for thirteen years now
I've been on so many flights, it's like my record's clear now
A.K.A. the man, A.K.A. I never ran
Don't make me turn this red light on your head like you Roxanne
Only talk to bosses, not the second-in-command
Niggas bringin' talks to me, you better have a plan
'Cause they don't have a cure for all my pain
A.K.A. it's Not Nice and I live up to my name
Gyah, gyah! Diss The Boy? Are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way, when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim
A.K.A. it's Not Nice and it's not a fuckin' game
Gyah, gyah! You and I, we're not the same
Posted like Ibaka, got your wifey runnin' brains
She was there with boydem, kicked my front door off the frame
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Trap, trap, trappin' in the rain
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Just know I'm a shooter first and rap is not my thing
A.k.a. it's Not Nice and I live up to my—
Hidin' in the racks
I don't pay tax, twelve on my back
Might drive the Caddy around but I never lack
Baka not with the shit? So yeah, who tellin' you that?
I went to jail the day they released Men in Black
When I came out, Timberlake was bringin' Sexy Back
Facts, nigga! Facts!
I fell in love with my strap
Named my son Milli 'cause I want a milli' to stack
Gyah, gyah! Go run and tell that
You niggas move like the cops, don't make me pepper your block
Out the window while the whip's movin', that's a hell of a shot
Fuck all my opps, I'll put you niggas on FOX
Gyah, gyah! Diss The Boy? Are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way, when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim
A.K.A. it's Not Nice and I live up to my—
Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, "Drake is just a younger you"
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on
Hunnit racks bustin' out the wrapper
All y'all niggas don't matter
I hit threes off-balance
I switch hands like Allen
I'm just blessed, full of talent
For the whole 6, I'm wildin'
You think she your baby girl
She text us like Dallas
Oh, shit, guess it don't matter
Talk down on me, I'm flattered
Whole Freebandz on Xanax
Y'all can't do no damage
Wrong cup, guess it don't matter
This one tastes like candy
This one must be Hendrix
Fuck y'all boys, y'all finished
You're dead!
I don't talk to hoes about business
Diamond in my tooth from the dentist
Put a nigga name in the Guinness
'Member when my phone was on minutes
I ain't dead yet like I'm Bruce Willis
I ain't really worried 'bout a image
Y'all still treat it like a scrimmage
Uhh, yeah
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever, I haven’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
So I’m single, thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m lookin' forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same
I'm just
Issa 21 (Young savage), issa Jeff (Issa Jeffery)
Issa profit, dawg (Big racks), issa net (Got it on score)
I watched you go sell four million, issa stretch (Issa, issa)
You gave somethin' to the cops, issa sketch (Issa picture)
Issa drawin' (It's Picasso), issa foreign (Foreign, skrrrrt)
This look fun (this looks fun), that looks borin' (That looks dumb)
Girl, stop textin' me so much, issa 'nnoying (Bitch, stop texting me)
Issa bloody LaFerrari, issa fortune (Skrrt skrrrrrt)
Issa 40 (Forty, shorty), issa 30 (Thirty, thirty)

I get it how I live it
I live it how I get it, y'all don't really get it
I pull up in a lemon, blocks get to spinnin'
Money 3D printin'
Never had a limit, never been religious
I just always had opinions
My daddy told me, "Listen
You better get some money and not die and go to prison"
So you see
Yeah, I got rich and stayed free
Free the dawgs doin' B.I.Ds
I know everybody not like me
Ayy, got the nerve to want a Bentley for her birthday
I said, "Maybe I could rent it for your birthday
Matter of fact I need a favor for the remix
Maybe I can get some 50s for your birthday"
Ayy, get to sneakin' for you, bae
Say we talk but we ain't speakin' every day
And I know you know what P about to say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, news from back home
This when it hurts to be gone
Two more young names to be carved out of stone
One summer day that went horribly wrong
Got my dawg on the phone
Cryin' and sayin' to leave him alone, but I'm not leavin' his side
I know that somebody died, somebody's child
Some people ducked down and some people hide
Some people just cannot react in time
Bullets do not choose a victim
It is the shooter that picks 'em
They just can't wait to get you in the system
The district attorney could use a conviction
Told you no guns and then you didn't listen
Life is so heavy with that on your soul
Dedicate this to Shyanne and Josh
And pour sumthin' out for the lives that they stole
416
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply inside
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply
Trust
Trust who?
Watchin' my back even when I'm in the booth
Oh, trust who?
Doin' my thing, but I'm down to come clean, not like you
I wanna make you feel the weight's off your shoulders too
I'll take it
Just tell me it can't be that crazy
And even if it is that crazy, baby
I'll take it
I want you, I know you're not an angel
Not you
Oh, just save it
Don't waste your time
'Cause I'm wavy and I'm sayin' things
That I don't mean, but I do mean
And I don't want you to miss me
'Cause there's no way that you're sorry
And you're crying and you're sayin' things
That I do believe, but I don't even
Want you to get in my mind
I'm supposed to be in your mind (Oh woah)
For the first time in a long time
For the first time in a long
For the first time in the longest time
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply inside
First time in a long time
Hurtin' deeply
Yeah (Now, oh, baby)
Ayy
Hurtin' deeply inside
Trust
Trust
Trust
Trust who?
Trust me and I can set you free
Left your man, came straight to me
You the real MVP, my love
Ride dirty like Pimp C
You a real ten-speed freak, shawty
You was everything a nigga need
You was everything to me, my love
Why you keep that little shit from me?
Left me down on bended knee
When I scooped you in the Maybach
The only time a nigga ever made you take a backseat
Why you do that little shit to me, shawty?
When you know that we was meant to be
Why'd you keep those things from me, my love? (Love)
I've given you enough time
Hurtin' deeply inside
Trust
Trust
Hurtin' deeply, deeply
Thought I knew the real, then they flipped
How many times did I ask about this, on God?
Why you let me find out like this, on God?
Houston, we got a problem, my dawg
All my niggas love you, got us all involved
Ain't no goin' back to how we started off
No, no, no, no
Yeah
It's Drizzy, baby
You already know what it is
It's the first time—I'm high, it's the first time I smoked in like 3 months
I'm sorry, Mama, I had to do it to 'em
40 I see you
O, I see you, homie
I stayed late tonight, right?
You know what happen when I stay late, haha
Yeah
Boi-1da!
I swear, it's like this every single time
Toronto, I got you
I got us
Yeah
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, well, I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to, the artists I put on with
Don't ever ask for nothing 'cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth full of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it "playing checkers"
I'm never doing verses, I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money, I'll be happy to connect you
Life is better than it's ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the president
Someone cut the lights on, where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryna zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers all liars and they women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last-Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me, Just write every single thing you need down"
And he got it for me, and I'm as happy can be now
'Bout to start balling like I'm coming off a rebound
Yeah, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because a nigga spit crack—bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryna get their swagger right
'Cause I done came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you, pussy-ass hater, you should do you
You ain't heard of me, then you should go and get a Blue's Clue
Oops! I mean a red clue; Wayne's here, suu whoop
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging, I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF, but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake, I hate to see 'em so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burning like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And know the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me, but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth? Then pull the zipper down and see
(No homo, though)
Took niggas out the hood like I'm from there
So you know it's all good when I come there
I hear you talk about your city like you run that
And I brought my tour to your city, you my son there, nigga
But I had to come through for the remix
On my haven’t-done-a-verse-in-eight-weeks shit
And if a nigga say my name, he the hot shit
But if I say the nigga name, he still the hot shit
Fucked up, lucky I don't feed into the gossip
Niggas act like they don't know, but they should know
Yeah, I just think it's funny how they dangling the bait
But I'm the one that's killing niggas on the hooks, though
And niggas ain't got a grill, still ice-grill hating
I know y'all already know Mike Will Made It
Just looking at the numbers, nigga, I feel amazing
I'll call Michael Jordan up and Mike will make it
I'm the young rap nigga with the 'Melo deal
You need to come to OVO for a better deal
Just know a million ain't shit once you get a mil'
And niggas say it’s all good
That’s how you better feel, nigga, nah!
Fuck that, this year I'm talking big stuff
Rolling through the city like a young nigga bricked up
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That's why we never gave a fuck
When a fuck nigga switched up, damn!
True, you're a star in my head (It's the truth)
You nuh need fi raise war with my friends, no, no
True, you're so bad, we don't need to pretend
But I don't want war with you, or my friends
You're my best friend
You're my best friend
Because, true, when we can party again
You'll see you, you're my best friend
Please don't let this go
We spent the last three summers on the road
You're my best friend
You're my best
I just don't want any war
No one at home
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
I talk gray, I don't keep it white and black
Only say "I love you" just so I can hear it back
Sometimes, other times I'd love to have you back
Can't think of a night that we ain't turn up to the max
To the max, no
Like the album just went platinum, yeah
Turnt up to the max
If they pop somebody's chain, then we gotta get it back
No discussion to be had, we ain't goin' out like that
Man, we lit
Got it on the dresser, I've been under pressure
They wanna see me laid out on a stretcher
Gotta keep my head up
(Get 'em right, get 'em right
What you finna do, Gus?)
Now all of a sudden, people say we cousins
I keep hearin' all this "You my brother" talk, I can't relate to nothin'
My broski down to ride
Made a knot in the line
You can never break ties
We don't really rate those yutes there
That's a whole other side
That's a whole 'nother vibe
They ain't really on shit, yeah
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Yeah, uhh
How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate it when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could
It's in our nature—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
This verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let 'em all go
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can’t afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple "I think that we’re ready"s
Couple "I think that we should we wait"s
Are we actin' like a couple ?I’m just tryna get it straight
Cause I’m over here convinced that it’s too early for mistakes
And then
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night, every night was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accident
I’m confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed chivalry? They need to get their sentencin'
Meanwhile we arguing and I can’t get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end
See it's funny cause I never thought this would end
But then the season changed
You were my, you were my, you were my girl
Shoulda made, shoulda made you my world
Shoulda done everything to make you happy, baby
Oh yeah
Can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and fly
And I’m too fly for this shit
Oh-a wooh
I am Japanese if you please
Ugh, Tez keeps tellin' me he just turned 30
Havin' dreams of bein' single forever, he's gettin' worried
And I'm scared too, 'cause I'm in the same boat
Good women are rare too, none of them have came close
Me I haven't changed much, you know how I play it
Better safe than sorry
'Stead of searchin' for substance at every single party
Baby, bein' part of this life
I feel like I'm bound to end up with somebody that's been with everybody
I need you to rescue me from my destiny
I'm tryna live right and give you whatever's left of me (yeah)
'Cause you know life is what we make it
And a chance is like a picture, it'd be nice if you just take it
Or let me take it for you, I'm just down to ride
Or we can roll around the city 'til you finally decide
I've got more than a thing for you, tattoo and an ink for you
Right over my heart, girl, I'll do the unthinkable
(EarlOnTheBeat)
Back home on a presi', I'm Obama, ayy, I condone the drama, ayy
I tongued down Madonna, ayy, do you need pajamas? Yeah
Stayin' the night, girl, you promised it
I hide in the cave like Osama did
I'm blowin' a bag in the Diamond District
You need me like dollars that are owed to you, yeah
Money and me are the same, but I just don't fold for you, yeah
Run me a body, I'll put a Range on the road for you
I don't know what you were told, but I ain't mad at you, baby
I have been up three days
Adderall and redbull
This call is a mistake
There’s something strong in this water bottle
I hear you got a new chick
A dancing little Barbie doll
I feel so pathetic
But you still haven’t heard it all
Fuck that new girl that you like so bad
She’s not crazy like me I bet you like that
I said fuck that new girl that’s been in your bed
And when you’re in her I know I’m in your head
I’m just saying you can do better
Always turned you out every time we were together
Once you had the best you can’t do better
Baby I’m the best so you can’t do better
I ran into your homeboys
They’re all fucking idiots
You’re not even my boyfriend
But they're tripping because I’m in the club
Yeah that’s right I’m dancing
And something cool is in my cup
I’ma send a sexy picture
To remind you what you’ve given up
Fuck that new girl that you like so bad
She’s not crazy like me I bet you like that
I said fuck that new girl that’s been in your bed
And when you’re in her I know I’m in your head
I mean, I’m just saying you can do better
Always turned you out every time we were together
Once you had the best boy, you can’t do better
Baby I’m the best so you can’t do better
Go to Palm Springs for a daytrip
Freeband, October's Own, it's the same shit
Shawty keep on knockin' back the shots, better pace this
Woah, woah, banknotes, presidential faces
Woah, woah, Bankhead, started seein' spaceships, woah
We just started fuckin', she impatient
Now she want a butt lift, now she want some LASIK
Just to see the bag clearer, that way she can chase it
Ayy, ayy
I remember grade six, I was up in Payless tryna get some Asics
Now I'm Nike'd down in a motherfuckin' snake pit
Now I'm type of nigga give it out and I don't take shit (808 my crew)
Like what?
(Who made this?) Yeah, yeah
(JB made this, hahahaha)
Six, six, six, six, six, six
Baow
Yeah
Fivi, Sosa, viral, movie
I'm in this bitch with the Wooski
Ball in the summer like Drew League
Champagne got me loopy
Glizzy Bop lookin' groovy
All the demons lookin' moody (What?)
All the demons lookin' moody
Skrrt 'round there in your ends, whole southside on ten
Not like them, make men lean out Benz
That's how a man get blem, you and your friends
This Hermés from runway, this ain't Ralph Lauren
Tell them again, loved her way back when
Drunk so I type "Je t'aime" but don't hit send
Send some bread to the pen
All my G's are blessed, we check in for them
Whole lotta charges laid to this day
No confessions for them
Man really feel no ways, these man waste
No progression for them
Think you're bad, just wait, food get ate
And that's just lessons for them
Sosa (Sosa), Fivi (Fivi), lookin' like KD and Kyrie (I am)
My TD Bank is on what? (What?)
My TD Bank is on Kylie (Ayy, ayy)
Tribeca in the lobby, all these niggas gettin' dodgy (Baow)
When we see 'em, it's a body (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Fivi (Fivi), Sosa (Sosa), viral (Viral), movie (Movie)
I'm in this bitch with the Wooski (I am)
Ball in the summer like Drew League
Champagne got me loopy (Baow)
Glizzy Bop lookin' groovy (Baow)
All the demons lookin' moody
(All the demons lookin' moody)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Fivi (Fivi), Sosa (Sosa), viral (Viral), movie (Movie)
I'm in this bitch with the Wooski (I am)
Ball in the summer like Drew League
Champagne got me loopy
Glizzy Bop lookin' groovy (Ayy, what? What?)
All the demons lookin' moody (Ayy, look)
Ayy, ayy
Fivi, Sosa, viral, movie
I'm in this bitch with the Wooski
Ball in the summer like Drew League
Champagne got me loopy
Glizzy Bop lookin' groovy
All the demons lookin' moody (What?)
All the demons lookin' moody
Ayy, ayy
Hands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinkin' of
But how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me
'Cause you don't know who I was before you
And basically, to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, but you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, but maybe in time in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, we could do it
It was you and I and only I, mmm
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably a
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you, oh
Oh, oh
Hey there, pretty girl
You know exactly what you got
And I don't blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the light's so bright
And the money's so right
And it's comin' in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas
And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
And it go, "Hey now, now, watch her go down"
Oh, oh, oh
She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life
And she's scared of ending up alone
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
''Cause the ones you throw will get her out of
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas
And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
And it go, "Hey now, now, watch her go down"
Oh, oh
We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin', all-star weekend
One hotel room that all y'all sleep in
Housekeeper knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin' right all season
But you always with me on the night y'all leavin'
Ask Lo, ask Lo, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight, it's prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh, because I never had you, although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think that I'm going crazy
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas
And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
And it go, "Hey now, now, watch her go down"
Oh, oh, oh
I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
Even when you sleep in my bed
I know you're not mine officially
And all the things I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a "hold on"
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show 'em off and shine 'em up, and line 'em up, oh
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me, or line me up, no
You got your trophies
I know how you like to show 'em off and shine 'em up, and line 'em up, oh
I'm not your trophy, baby
I won't let you show me off or shine me up, or line me up, no
Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me
(Check it out, check it out)
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet
Promise that I won't forget
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, oh, yes, I'll be there, oh
About to board a flight, sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you but I'm so far away (I'm so)
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh
Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me
(Check it out, check it out)
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me, fly
Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on?
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause
You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me "Heartbreak Drake", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah
Uh
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Swear I’m putting on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on, like
Man
Yeah, look
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
Stay in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
Think you know me? That's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck 'bout jeans and crep
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like goin' tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that
Drank in my cup holder, hope this shit don't spill
Pull up in the new edition and that's word to Johnny Gill
How I come up with this shit and all these verses that I kill?
I have no imagination, everything I do for real
Bitch I'm camouflaged, down put your camera phone down
If she got a ass and the girl a fan, it's going down
I'ma fuck you like I've been waiting a century for it
Give the pussy up and I'll trade you the memory for it
In the bedroom forever, that's what her roommate will tell you
Man I just hear this shit and think about what Tunechi will tell you
He might call up Patricia, she 'bout to call up Melissa
Tell 'em come to the cribbo and do them both, double dribble
I'm colder than a hospital, she love the dick that I give her
Hit her from the front, back, side, twist her like cigarillos
I put the gun to the pillow, I don't want blood on my clothes
Gotta keep that Trukfit fresh, shoutout to all of my hoes
(Tunechi) That's just how my OG would sum it up
I been working all winter just to fuck the summer up
It's just me and 2 Chainz, but the chain's never tucked though
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga fuck y'all
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me, I'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop
Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We should've did this already
Said I got a email today
Kind of thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't wanna come on strong
'Cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I get lonely too
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
I get lonely
I get lonely
Just like you

24 seconds, yeah, you better not stop
You got 24 seconds, can you beat the shot clock?

Wondering why, why, why (Oh why)
Know you ain't shy, shy, shy (Oh why)

Better let go of your pride (Do-do)

Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down
You got 24 seconds and it's starting right now
Shot clock

Shot clock

Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, my nigga)
Five years of dating, tired of being patient
What the fuck you're waiting for? Oh, yeah
It's a lot of niggas hating and I don't entertain 'em
But damn, you gotta give me more
(Shhh, I know, I know and I'm really trying, but...)
Oh-ohh, if you don't want it like me
I could think about a hundred things I could be doing right now
Than wasting my time with you, oh (Do-do)
Okay, okay, since you gotta have it your way (Do-do)
I'm have to start that clock on you (Do-do)
We gon' see what's up

Shot clock
L, Love
Add "-rs" and that's surely what we are
Flip it 'round, add "-ve" and let's see if this goes far
Full of chuckles and cuddles and sometimes, eye puddles
Compose love like we're Mozart
You must remember wakin' up in Paris with the blunt
You must remember fuckin' me like anytime you want
What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?
Now we back in California, we don't even speak
That's a no no
Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do, that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you, where Jen and Melissa
(Say Hi, M)
Tell the squad I said what up girl
Look at me, look at me, look at I
Ballin' out, swear I use to be shy
Young nigga
Back when I, was tryna' make a, MI
My nigga, when can I
How is this shit goin' how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives
I hope that they remember me, for everything I did
It's some views from the 6
Just some views from the 6
Young champagne checkin' in, man, Tity Boi shit ringin' off
'Member I was on pre-paid, I would act like my shit was ringin' off
'Member shorty told me she thought the raps good but the singing's off
Watch on Young Dro now, man, boi-oing shit blingin' off
Where the racks at? (racks)
All I know is they keep comin' to me like a flashback, nigga, what? (what?)
Half a million out in Vegas, it ain't no blackjack, nigga, naw (naw)
Quavo Sinatra, but we could never be the Rat Pack, nigga, naw
Yeah, okay, we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erykah
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, "Money ain't a thang!"
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game
They know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rack
Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at
Straight like that
Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm riding, Weezy with me
I just stepped out of the strip club, made 5000 look like 50
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay
I made $2 million since last Wednesday
And I hate y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Saying I ain't drop shit, everything gon be fine
Worrying about your old girl, trying to see if she's mine
Nigga she's with me when she tells you she needs some "me time"
It's our time, so fuck y'all!
I'm really about to go Spring Break now
And start taking shots in this muthafucka
And you didn't have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in this muthafucka?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muthafucka
You thought niggas going pop in this muthafucka?
Young Money, power, respect in this bitch
You would think we got the LOX in this muthafucka
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacing me
Take Care and Carter IV it won't be long 'til they can see the lights
And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy nigga, I'm not one, so call it a night, call it a night
And I run this, and y'all know that
I take the purple and pour that, all in the Sprite, all in the Sprite
Just got back from Turks and Caicos, hoes all at the villa
Only nigga making albums with no fucking filler
New deal on the table, look like 'bout like ten milla
Shout my lawyer, man, he a contract killer
You know 305, Ricky, that's my fucking nigga
Did this shit right here for Baka, Preme, Styles, and Gilla
Did this shit right here for Reese, Sosa, Fredo, Durk
You let Drizzy get a verse, you gon' get this work
Yeah, at the top it's just us, nigga
Yeah, that's why I don't really trust niggas
See, my family and the money is a must, nigga
All the fame and all the pussy's just a plus, nigga
Yeah
Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go
For my nigga Hush
Yeah, look
Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin' on crushed leaves
They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meech like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies
I need plenty
Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down, break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin'
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
I had to find a way to get someone's attention
Then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Riding round the city, plastic cup of Henny
Find a nigga like me, truth be told, I don’t know many
I say shout my driver Lauren, that 62 with curtains
Can't see shit, I don’t know where the fuck I’m at for certain
When it boils down, I’m just a T.O. nigga
But bitches tell me that I look just like a creole nigga
New Orleans know it’s love, everytime I’m in town
Shout out my nigga Tez, that's my brother my round
Spending tomorrows money, I call it mañana
Off the rack just ain't my style, I call it designer
One of my baddest women ever, I call her Rihanna
... But that's cause her name is Rihanna!
I’m in the condo just posting watching Miami kill
I might just walk to the arena and watch it for real
Ashes to ashes, me, Rozay and Khaled
Smoking bull riders, shit moving slow as a ballad
Tattoo on your ass, it’d be nice if you show me

Pushin' five Cadillacs like a politician

And if I gotta land, I'ma—
Stick that motherfucker at the Clearport and park that
Uh
I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time, whoa
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever, and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go, whoa
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you'll tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
The girl or the world? You see, someone gotta lose
I thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose?
What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time?
And what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind?
Night's fallin', lights glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please don't move on
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
Sent a message to my Instagram

Ring-a-ding, ding

Out here with your Brampton tings
Fucking all your Pickering tings
She said she wanna come to Toronto
She wanna come to the 6 side
She know that's the best side
Caribana, soca dancer, Machel Montano
Black red bandana, oh, a trip planner
She know who to check when she come around
She know who to check whenever she comes in town
She knows what I have to calm her down
She knows it's not something to run from now
Don't run, don't
Listen, all I wanna do is smoke with you
Sit down, have dinner with the folks with you
Touch road, hit Fring’s then Bloke with you
Don't par with a broke boy, I'll do the most
Would you tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Since when are you all grown up
Since when do you know Mona
Since when do you not come home
I heard you got too much on your shoulders
Your mother just called my phone up
Sounds like your party is over
Girl, you know I heard a lot of things, don't joke with me
Girl, you know I
And I know you're down, I know you're still down
Ring-a-ding, ding
Let me know if it's a ting
Out here with your Brampton ting
Fucking all your Pickering tings
She said she wanna come to Toronto
She wanna come to the 6 side
She know that's the best side
Caribana, calypso dancer, Bajan accent
Blue yellow bandana, oh, trip planner
She know who to check when she come around
She know who to check whenever she comes in town
She knows what I have to calm her down
She knows it's not something to run from now
Don't run
Pace yourself, pace yourself, don't run baby
Don't run, baby
I know you're scared
Inception is everything you're wanting
Just trust me
I'll take it easy on you, babe
Just trust me, just trust me
Just trust me, just trust me
I'll make it easy
Just trust me, girl
I'll take it easy
Say you'll be mine, say we'll be fine, say we'll be together
Selfish of me to ask, since I be the reason we don't last forever
Wished that you knew all that I do to make this thing go right
Promise to be all that you need
I won't leave you, baby
No, cause I just wanna love you
I will never ever put nobody else up above you
I just wanna kiss you, baby
I just wanna hug you 'til the end, baby, 'til the end
And I say, good girl's got her mind right
She been raised right, being patient I know you waiting
Waiting on the good things when the time's right
You should let me get to know you, baby
But I just wanna put it on you, if you want to
Baby, tell me what you gon' do, girl
I can make you feel perfect, girl, you're worth it
I just need to see you work it, girl
I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I can’t believe we’re finished
My life is movin’ fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I can’t put this behind me
I thought you would’ve called by now, by now
You could’ve had my all by now, by now
It’s been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, It's not that I'm surprised, It's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I can't go to bed
I'm thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go?
Why am I in bed alone?
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?
Do you even live there?
Or did you take a U-Haul?
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?
We were on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, It's not that I'm surprised, It's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
Okay, this just in girl the paper so long
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long
So long 'til you get off from work, but listen
I got some better positions for you to take in for so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Then do my touchdown dance in it no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
You're Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya, girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know, I’ll keep a secret for ya
I'm tryna ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in
Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, or it's mine
You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start
Keep this whole stripper thing secret in a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watching our every single move like casinos
These days these new girls, they got me nervous
(Put a bib on me)
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
(Put a bib on me)
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
(Rock me real slowly)
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good? (Put a bib on me)
Are we still good? Are we still good?
(Just like a baby, drooling over you)
I am on a 24-hour champagne diet
Spilling while I'm sipping, I encourage you to try it
I'm probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it
The club owner supply it, boy, I'm on that fly shit
I am what everybody in my past don't want me to be
Guess what? I made it!
I'm the motherfuckin' man, I just want you to see
Come take a look, get a load of this nigga
Quit fronting on me, don't come around
And try and gas me up, I like running on E
I, I-I-I'm on my Disney shit - Goofy flow
On records I'm Captain Hook, and my new car is "Rufio"
Damn, where my roof just go?
I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shakin' somethin' cause that's what Drumma produced it for
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for
Like leaving girls that love me, and constantly seducing hoes
I'm losing my thoughts, I said "Damn, where my roof just go?"
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl
They can't help it and I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous, but bitch, I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow
They can't help it and I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous, but bitch, I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow
They can't help it and I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous, but bitch, I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow
Don’t it seem like
Like I’m always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time
A terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working
Made me an addict
There's way more people that want it
Than people that have it
I don't get it, I would hate to think I tricked ‘em
They fall victim to my system
Guess I sure know how to pick em
And I’m always her regret
Yeah, I’m always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever’s coming next
It goes up and down, it’s just up and down
She’s crying now but she’ll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
And expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she’s not the type to hold grudges
I’m wrong..
This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with
That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
New, new, new, new, new
Or is everything I'm doing too late?
Late, late, late, late
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, am I too late?
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Show me if this is brand new (Brand new)
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
New, new, new (Brand new), oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
On the hood you see the Stallion, passenger a stallion
Niggas gettin' nervous, I'm passin' out the Valium
I suggest you pop it, but please don't get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerkin' up in 400 West Peachtree
Bet you those same hoes'll see me, be like that's how you feelin'?
Used to stay up at The Twelve, now you're worth like 12 million
Boy, you did it, boy, you did it, you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected, I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fuckin' women that knew Biggie, so it really ain't no biggie
It's just OVO and XO, and Freebandz the committee
And shout out to Toronto, bitch, I'm Tony in my city, huh
Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say "My baby's famous and I knew it" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And "Hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest"
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home
Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man
(Yeah man)
I got money that I saved then I'm back on road
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes the same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone
Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back
I got money that I saved then I'm back on road
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes the same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone
Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back
I got money that I saved then I'm back on road
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes the same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone
Then bitch don't expect no love when I'm back
I'm tryna do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryna shoot down my flight before it lands, before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me, then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin' rich s'posed to solve that
And these days, women make offers
And who the hell am I to say (No, no, no)?
My ex sendin' late night texts
'Cause she don't know how to let (Go, go, go)
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models
Standin' in the cold, ah, yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink and I'm all in they ear
Sayin' she should be the one I see every time that I'm here
But when am I really even here?
Black Suburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old handprints on it
But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux, I don't really give a fuck
And we only gettin' older
So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past
It's funny when you comin' in first, but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her, oh-oh
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up
Are you feeling good tonight?
This thing got me thanking God for life
I just can't explain
I can't explain, no, no, yeah
Look, it's gon' be a long long time 'fore we stop
Boy better know, they better know who make the scene pop
All I ever needed was a chance to get the team hot
Only thing I fear is a headshot or a screenshot
Pree me, dem a pree me
You know they only call me when they need me
I never go anywhere, they never see me
I'm the type to take it easy, take it easy
I took girls in the very first text I sent
I don't beg no lovers, I don't beg no friends
If you wanna link, we can link right now
Skeppy Wiz and Drake, it's a ting right now
Are you feeling good tonight
I feel good
Got some time off, Girl it's been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause I'mma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
I feel good
Got some time off, girl, it's been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause I'mma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this
I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still…
I feel good
Got some time off, girl, it's been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause I'mma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this
I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still…
You finally start to care
I show up so unprepared
You're ready for something new
I'm still where I was last year
Meanwhile we're talking it out
You keep leaving things at my house
Seems like you're wanting to stay
But you need to know..
I'm on a wave, I'm on a ride
I'm everywhere, I'm hard to find
You want a man, I'm just a guy
Busy as fuck, you know what's up
Now got a life, back where I stay
Still pay a car note for this girl, around my way
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa
I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa
Yeah, I don't play no games boy, I'm at your head (At your head)
All about the family, niggas took the pledge (Took that shit)
Now you gotta own up to that shit you said
You can't push us to the edge, Trouble from the edge
Hit the gas and we outta there
Do it for the six, because we started there (Started)
I got a girl that used to ride around with 'Pac an' them ('Pac)
I gotta get it, you came from my lil' partner then (Fuck)
Yeah, Richard Mille, heavy on the watch (Bitch)
Extra million just to see the Maybach drop (Drop, drop)
Crest white smile on my face
Once I get to snappin' ain't nobody safe (Nobody)
Reality gon' hit ya or we gon' hit ya
Either way if they was with ya, they goin' with ya
Mike WiLL Made-It (Mike WiLL)

Responsible for everything you listen to
While mediocre talent proceeds to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to;
Started poppin' bottles cuz it's ATL tradtion to
Celebrate at Bymark, fuck 'em at the SoHo
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin' and these bitches want a snow blow
And they just give me head while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ shoulda won that
Nelissa and Wristpect, Man the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Niko, party with Azuka
Shout goes out to 1da, shout goes out to future
Shout goes out to Getty, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch just can't seem to hold it steady
Cuz I see the flame flickerin', ex-girls bickerin'
Got these women jockin' me from Heart Lake Road to Pickerin
Tried to send my nigga short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'd take a minute if you're listenin'
Please start doin' you, I been doin' me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody even if you're suin' me
My brother P-Reign knows, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hoppin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just holla if you got me and fuck you if you had me
Shout out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver and 40, man you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to P-Plus

Good evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with?
Do it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl
This song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree in 10 years
Who's paying for all that therapy? Umm, nigga not me, yeah
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I’m done with bad bitches, know I’m coming straight to you good girl
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon’ really love us

We don’t talk for like some months
I ended up fucking with her friend
I ain't never satisfied, I ain't never satisfied

Ikebe, pressing on me heavy
Pressing up against me real close
Bakasi, moving on me wassy
Time is moving real slow
Sound like my mic is right
I am spending much more than I’m making
On these cars and these vacations, is that too much information?
I just bought a Lamborghini, I'm not even into racing
With a windshield full of tickets cause I live right by the station
I am tryna figure out why you so mad at me
Yes, I’m with Young Money, tell the magazine stop asking me
I be with the dread with the tattoos on his head
And a flag the color red like a fucking low battery

Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of styrofoam
Big cheese big bread call that shit a calzone

Got some things on the wrist, Cartier with the diamonds
If this was 10 years ago nigga would've went diamond

I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'

Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in

Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say "Get it off your chest"
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention
Freebandz, movie
Even though I used to act, man, this shit is not a act, nigga

"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song (Migo!)

She coulda paid tuition five times, still stripping
I just throw a couple bills, and she'll have a pair of heels
Oh no, there I go, magic tricking on your ass
Throwing every president except for Nixon on your ass
Make you rich, I feel like I should make commission on your ass
Wonder what you would ever do if I went missing on your ass
Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight, who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say, you should say it right now
(You should say it right now)
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
I know you said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?
If we gonna do something about it, we should do it right now
(We should do it right now)
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it
I was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
Yeah, yeah
Sayin'
Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (Fly away)
I can't say, I can't compare
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?
I was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)

For real, I mean I want you in the worst way
And I know one day doesn’t mean the first day

Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
Till I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high

Yeah, live from the Waldorf in Berlin
Coming at you once again
With stories of truth and stories of sin
Yeah
Yeah, the ball is in your court
No defense, nobody's keeping score
No offense but I've played this before
Maybe you can and you just don't care anymore
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
Yeah
And I’m right back here when I said I wouldn't
You were never a good girl but you're a better woman now
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving, evolving
Look, you remind me of Jane Birkin, your body insane in person
Wanna do special things for you, you deserve it
But you're too famous to buy you purses
That barely scratches the surface
This time is different, you give me purpose
Tell me you taking it serious, I gotta ask how serious?
'Cause your serious has just been not that serious
Got me on tour acting like I'm not that curious
Ignoring all the pussy that's thrown at me
Been thinking 'bout home actually
Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley and Niks has Ezee
And I, I don’t even know what I have anymore
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
E...
Wisdom tooth, got Perc' in my system
I've been buyin' Birkins in rhythm
Save 'em for my wife when I get her
Right now, not the season for givin'
Bossin' up the city, that's a big mood
Niggas we don't even fuck with gettin' Ms too
But just know we could cut that off again too
Sparkle up the wrist, now that's a big mood
Ayy, things going my way, big mood
Exotic up the driveway, big mood
Double up the contract, big mood
If we don't have no contact, then we ain't cool
Had to hit up Jimmy, hit up Mike and tell 'em double
Triple, double, Chubbs is hoodied up, I feel like Russell
Baka, he a star, but still around to burst a bubble
Bitch, you crazy, don't pull up at 3 AM to cuddle
'Member when I used to go to clubs and pay the cover
Bitch, this not Fugazi, but my neck still changin' color
You haven't found another 'cause there ain't another
I break down a hunnid bag and give it to my cousin, ayy
Cashville, I got bands still like a boss
All they do is PR double-E me like I'm Dolph
They say "holy" when they see the chain, that's not a cross
Put the owl on it, you can never take it off
Ayy, things going my way, big mood
Exotic up the driveway, big mood
Double up the contract, big mood
If we don't have no contact, then we ain't cool
Had to hit up Jimmy, hit up Mike and tell 'em double
Triple, double, Chubbs is hoodied up, I feel like Russell
Baka, he a star, but still around to burst a bubble
Bitch, you crazy, don't pull up at 3 AM to cuddle
'Member when I used to go to clubs and pay the cover
Bitch, this not Fugazi, but my neck still changin' color
You haven't found another 'cause there ain't another
I break down a hunnid bag and give it to my cousin, ayy
Can I, can I save you from you?
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you've been sippin's not supposed to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, yeah
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making a mistake I never learned from
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you
Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours

Girl, quit playing you just drunk. You just saying shit
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait... No, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson
It's feeling like the second chance and its the first impression
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in
Making all the same mistakes and I'm just trying to correct it
And I fall...
I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type

The clock that you’ve been watching has been stopping
He makes you wait
What kind of man does that to a girl he wants
If you just give tonight to me
I promise my hands will say
They'll say
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don’t show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I need’s an address and I’m on my way
Don’t fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it’s worth waiting for
Because I’m on my way
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don’t show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I need’s an address and I’m on my way
Don’t fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it’s worth waiting for
Because I’m on my way
I love all my bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
A two dollar bill is still a couple dollars
And if any one of them niggas got a fuckin' problem
I'mma milk all of 'em cause they fuckin' cowards
I love red bitches, there's just something 'bout 'em
But I'm gettin' better pussy from a brown one
Been schoolin' y'all niggas, I'm your alma mater
I'm the shit, where the fly swatter
I know you dykin' who you eatin' on
Make me think about all them nights we got a threesome on
Make me think about how you suck it like your teeth are gone
If your friends hatin' on you, fuck 'em to each his own, yessir
I do my drugs then I sleep 'em off
Like it just be callin' me, I need to turn my ringer off
Ain't a fuckin' singalong unless you brought the weed along
That kush, okay I got it, that kush
Cop pounds and put my people on
We can take the stairs up to the stars that's where we belong
Fuck that shit you talk, I beat that pussy like production
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian, or like Jordan, beat the buzzer
Nigga, gimme what you've got, take that money like an usher
One man band, all you hear is repercussion
Told a bitch, too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction
She looked me in my eyes and said
Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin', I said shorty, you a beast
I love bad bitches, okay, what's the problem
If she thinks she gonna come up then I'mma fuckin' drown her
I'm wilder than public schools and public housing
Can't afford failure, I'm just browsing
I was 15 with $100,000
And if you talk trash I'mma fuckin' possum
And nigga, if your bitch got eye problem
You know what it is, armed robbery
Tunechi
I heard 'em tell me "Go get 'em, young"
I haven't seen a movie since I started livin' one
I be in a room full of bitches gettin' drunk
Smokin' like a point guard, no look, passin' blunts
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Euro, this and that
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And niggas schemin' on what I had, but
We gon' put money in the bag or a body in the bag (You choose)
And all these new bitches old news
Throwin' stacks at 'em like "That's prolly gon' bruise"
And every dream girl that I fucked came true
Now every night feels like deja vu
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you
I tell a baby, "Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes"
And I murder that pussy, and I ain't leave a clue
Cause I put her on her knees and made her swallow all the proof
That sick shit, I'm ill, yeah, I'm a fuckin' problem
I'm fine wit' it, though, bitches like fuckin' problems
And I can't solve shit if I'm the fuckin' problem
Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a fuckin' problem
Out the city, but you can't take the city out 'em
I know these hoes well, see the water spittin' out 'em?
Long story short, money always colorblind
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms
(Euro)
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
Had a few ugly bitches but I had to hide em
Can't live with em, Can't live without em
Can't trust them hoes poking holes up in condoms
Put a S on her breast, she a supermodel
If you swallow these kids, does that make you childish
Now she say I got a fuckin problem
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her
Her hair blown out like the 80s
I drive these bitches crazy, mental asylum should pay me
I ain't looking for a lady, call Will Smith to get you hitched
I ain't looking for a wife, I need a one night trick
That can ride it like that, suck it like this
Hit it from the back in the back of the whip
I'm a mac, I'm a pimp girl
You don't need make up, put this mac on your lips
She drive a X5, beefin' with her ex man
Baby Ima dog and a DMX fan
Told myself I wouldn't mess with my ex again
Popped a lil x then i tried explain
I keep it too real to ever be a lame
Too many girls in this world, you all be lame
She all on my dick cause I got street fame
Told that thirsty ass bitch don't speak my name
Kidd Kidd, a nut from the 9
Tell em don't worry bout me I'm just fine
Girl if you comin' with me then let's ride
I know you want money so don't waste my time
Uh, wear that ass out fuck her till we pass out
Fuck a hotel, we goin' to my mans house
Scratch that your baby mama was an Amtrak
We treat that pussy like some good weed and pass that
Yeah, to my niggas, she fuck my niggas
Bought some bitches, and she was wit' it
With you she wasn't, but she did it
She let you lick it, but never stick it
You be trippin, you say you fallin
Nigga you slippin, stupid ass nigga tryna' fall in love

You asking questions, bout what she was

She moved out of state, and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan and start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her momma is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin' down
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix
Shawty is goin' legit, shawty is goin' legit
Me, I'm supportin' this shit, this is a story
Came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit
I'ma just give it to you direct, instead of me throwin' this shit
You know you important and shit
You know I'm supportin' this shit
We used to do pornos when you would come over but now you got morals and shit
I got like four on the wrist and an adorable kid
I got the drac' in the studio and I don't just mean that I'm in this bitch
Please make the most of this shit
Don't just come close to some shit
I give you this bread, you run me some head
And then you go glow up a bit
She moved out of state, and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan and start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her momma is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to sli-
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix
Shawty is goin' legit, shawty is goin' legit
Me, I'm supportin' this shit, this is a story
Came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit
Her daddy is not around, momma is definitely not around
She got a business plan, but she just ain't had time to write it down
Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You popped a 325, you feelin' too good to worry tonight
She moved out of state, and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan and start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her momma is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to sli-
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix
Shawty is goin' legit, shawty is goin' legit
Me, I'm supportin' this shit, this is a story
Came for my life and I'm just recordin' this shit
All night I've, been staring, can you tell I want you?
Can't be too, wide open, there's nothing, I won't do
Oh, just thought you should know
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious
I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I believe in people like you
Uh, yeah, uh, look
Dress hangin' off your shoulder, barely sober
Tellin' me how you movin' away and startin' over
Girl quit playin' you just drunk, you just sayin' shit
And oh you dance? Dance like how? Like ballet and shit?
Oh, wait, no I get it girl, I'm wit it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like ya second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothin' new except for someone new
But how you s'posed to find the one when anyone'll come with you?
Talkin' to myself but I never listened
Cause man it's been a while and I swear that this one's different
That's why I'ma take you anyway you wanna go, let you meet my friends
So they can lecture me again about how reckless I have been
And I'm slowly runnin' out of all the time that I invested
Makin' all the same mistakes and I'm just tryin' to correct it
And I fall
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I believe in people like you
You know, you know
You know, you know
Uh, you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in ’02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin' like I'm bein' scouted 'til I'm out it
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know
You know, you know
You know, you know
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don’t get held up at the border
Yeah, so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that ’62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin' to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin' that that isn’t what your motive is
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know
You know, you know
You know, you know
Uh, when did you get like this?
Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, "This just ain't my style"
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile for me, no
When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before?
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store
Look, leave me, leave me, I can't fucking stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we 'posed to be together 'til the world end
But I don't really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all your sweaters and your heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call, you just tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that? Do that, do that, yeah
True, you're a star in my head (It's the truth)
You nuh need fi raise war with my friends, no, no
True, you're so bad, we don't need to pretend
But I don't want war with you, or my friends
You're my best friend
You're my best friend
Because, true, when we can party again
You'll see you, you're my best friend
Please don't let this go
We spent the last three summers on the road
You're my best friend
You're my best
I just don't want any war
No one at home
Que contigo los voy a gastar
Que pa' ti siempre voy a estar
Ahora Jimmy Choo, yo no más Superstar
Por ahí vienen los muchacho', me vienen a buscar
Hoy vamo' pa' la calle, no venga' a molestar
Ando en modo leyenda, en modo rockstar (Huh)
Pero yo soy tuyo y nadie lo va a cambiar
I am, I am
You know what I like
Oh yea, oh yea

Yeah, oh no, I'm ready

And you know the new shit sound so tough
So and so just walked in... so what?
I don't really vibe with alot of these niggas
I ain't really into giving more than one chance girl
I already tried with alot of these niggas, fuck that
That team don't know real, what's that? That can't be from here
That can't be what they believing is the best shit of the year
That's that fake shit, that's that fake shit
That's that top row of veneers
Just when they getting impatient is when I make a world premiere
Uh, damn, word?
Award shows coming? Make sure you spell that shit right
Make sure to give me all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff still in that Sprite
They watch us make the shit into the song
You ain't livin' that boy, stop stealin' that life
Anything can happen when I do see ya
Guess it all depend how I feel on that night
Live my life in hotels, bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend, bitch better have my tomb right
Ah, this is perfect for the women that I loved before
I love em all, I just love me more
Go outside
Big time forward...
Yeah
Wha'?!
Too mix up in drama to go outside
Too mix up in drama to free my mind
Jealous people around me, I need to change my life
Woii yoii...

These days lookin' like a dream since I've been on the road
Seein' shit that I ain't seen before and still there's no place like home
Spendin' all my days on the west side oh
It don't feel the same on the other side no
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryin' to put tomorrow in my own hands right now
I ain't like these other bitches ya'll just don't really know
Tryin to box me in that FM Stereo
Where the fuck was you when I was broke and I needed help
Ain't nobody put me on, did that shit myself

Why's it so hard to believe that a good... good
And a real one
Really be so on the shit that all these niggas tryin' to hit ya
Shall we need one

The double standards that we have break my heart
Why's it so hard to believe that she love to
Be selective
And somehow magically could still control her pussy
And be happy bout it cause she gets it
Yeah it's so hard
And all the stigmas that we have break my heart
But you're not ready
To open up your mind and be mature already
You focused on the shit you seen before already
Never laid no visions till they pure already
I'm bored already
Of all the judgement they so insecure already
I was makin' my own music in my home already
You know I'm due for mixtape number 4 already

Spending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone, I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there
Come right in, set your bag down
Took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh

And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown

Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground
Yeah, all hail Mr. Lyrical
Spades or the Opus, baby, what you got a feeling for?
I can show you new things, have you feeling spiritual
Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes - miwacles

Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you
If I came to your crib, would you open the door?
I don't wanna go down that road, no more
Said you wanted it bad, but girl I wanted it more
You're the only one I wanna be with, yeah, yeah yeah
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you
Let me show you what it is
I was birthed up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
If you lookin' for the good then we got 'em in the trap like, ooh wee
Took 'em from white sneaks to Louis
This metaphor might sound a little confusin' but
Y'all don't really know me if you know me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I done come all way from the Days Inn
And all the hotels that I stayed in
And I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good
And now I say it's sittin' at amazin'
Girls tryna SoHo lobby us
Hear 'em all screamin' then it's probably us
But I can't blame females
Females can't really ignore somethin' this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town?
Two or three days, I shut you down
Chilin' with the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince, he rep two up, two down
Anyone I know get used to me
I'm far from the man that I used to be
And I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providin' that
Understand that I'm worldwide, you get it how you want it wherever you be residin' at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK and from Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans, but, yo, this hook is for my exes
With the other dudes she get picked for some take out
Until they slip up and then they break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm leaned back, scopin'
Lookin' for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipatin' us livin' the good life
We go LA, VA, NY, TO
Sunshine and that heatstroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
Since Jay and Kellz ain't doin' they thing no more
Guess me and the boy Songz the replacement
Look I let the beat bang I don't claim colors
Honestly the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter but when it's winter time
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi coast
Couple days on the beach then it's adios (Killa)
Just look at what I done alone
You will swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
We been busy like some bees no honeycomb
And you could prolly feel the breeze when the money's blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I'll never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when I'm not functioning in tip top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs... drizzy
Uh, I'm tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a muhfuckin' killa, killa, killa, killa
Uh, and I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around shit will neva be the same
I'm a killa, killa, killa, killa
Uh, I'm tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a muhfuckin' killa, killa, killa, killa
Uh, and I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around shit will neva be the same
I'm a killa, killa, killa, killa nigga

(Oh yeah, let's call up one drink and let's all get wasted
One drink and let's all get faded, yeah)
Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfucking North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more, guess that they don't really make em like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell them all leave their cell phones
On the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, A.M to the P.M
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, that's that ish that drives me crazy
And that's all I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah, trust issues
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Let's call up one drink and let's all get wasted
One drink and let's all get faded, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Call up one drink and let's, let's call up one, uh
All my niggas so hungry, man they just eat what they kill
I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills
I might tell the whole crew come through
My squad gotta roll through come through
Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin'
Because they sure do come true
Then I say: this that fuckin' mob shit, this that fuckin' player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin' dugout like where all the fuckin' players sit
And like you just got traded
Girl you don't know who you're playin' with
Aww yeah, aww yeah, my sound is what up right now
I've been down, but I'm up right now
Nigga been backstrokin' and breaststrokin'
Through that lane that you left open
Man I don't give a fuck right now
Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low
'Bout to go drown in the cup right now, holla
Okay, you know you been on my mind, A-Town, I miss you
When ol' girl would come late and bring all her tips through
Break up her weed while I break down my issues
Get paper, she blows that, the next day, you know that
Daydream at night time I think too much
Then I hit the nightclub 'til it's daytime and I drink too much
Not time for no good girl, they hold on and they cling too much
I just want a hood bitch that tell me that I sing too much
Awww, yeah, shout out to the women playing y'all position
I be moving through my city like a politician
Hope you don't judge me cuz me and you are not all that different
You made me this way, you made me famous, you all assisted
New niggas tryna shine, I didn't condone it
But I'm back in this bitch, re-living the moment
I'm about to have it poppin off again
Drama bout to make it rain on Mary Poppins and her friends
We got....
I forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazing conversation
With this girl named Lorraine, who says she's from L.A
And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
She could be good for me yeahh
That's when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine
And the fact she's right here with me
She's starin' in my face, somethin had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh
I hate getting, messages from you, from you
It's like you know the perfect shit to say
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
I hate getting messages from you, from you
Especially when you say you should've stayed
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh
Ooh, I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do
But I still text you back, say I miss you too
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
I'm ready for ya
Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soakin in your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No options for, you sayin no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, what you waitin fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing
Yeah I hear you talkin, don't know who you tryin to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you bein a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya
Nothin on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please
Yeah I hear you talkin, don't know who you tryin to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you bein a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya
Uhh, red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you wanted fast? Define fast
Cause I could speed it up and make it lastAnd I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed
I'm ready, I'm wit it, still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed tooPlus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you
Bang! The baddest woman ever in the heart of South
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money 'til the death, I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready too, hope it's somethin that you thought about
Yeah I hear you talkin, don't know who you tryin to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you bein a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-I-I-I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'll throw your body on the stretcher
And let the chopper off, boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-bah-boom-bah
And drop your paramedic helicopter
I do this for my fans, you mothafuckas ain't shit to me
Are y'all kidding me? I'm fuckin' bum-rushin' the enemy
These knuckles will leave you bucklin' instantly
I’ll fucking get 10 men to start punching you viciously
Uppercuts will leave your stomach in misery
Like muscular dystrophy
That's for thinking you can come online publicly dissing me
You can pop your fists while I'm still crushin' you physically
This shit is child's play
You get ate side ways like the number infinity
I said, you need artist development
Before you come on the blog and then mention me
I'll stomp you out and make you a part of this history
Don't show me that, ‘cause this is about to be the bodybag of the century! Hold on! Hold on! You mothafuckas ain't shit to me
They say karma's a bitch, for you it's probably dentistry
Because the part of your mouth that's missing
Is only a reflection of what's scarring you mentally
So the gap between your teeth
Exists merely as an object of imagery to distract you from the real gap between us—and that's bars and delivery!
Change times whenever you want with your hat to the back
What the fuck you think you now? Black, nigga?
Y'all all know, we really got a problem with time, but fuck that!
For the last two years you've been givin' me the runaround
I managed to stay relevant
With every battle reaching over 200 thou'
You done the same, but your music's trash
So the industry will never love your style
Which makes you a earthquake
‘Cause you always gone be a disaster that remains underground
See, you just an entertainer, Diz! In other words: a fuckin' gimmick
And it's for so long that the delivery can mask those fuckin' lyrics
Your rhymes are put together sloppy and unorganized
That's why besides GrindTime we ain't fuckin' with it
So battlin' DNA will be the first time his verses have structure in it
So when you spit all aggressive with conviction
I be thinkin' that you actually mad
And then understand why you hate us New York niggas
‘Cause he drive us around all the time in taxi cabs
Like his rap battle D, he's supposed to be the big bad Dizaster
And when I see DNA, I'ma shoot him and let the 5th clap ya
I said "Dizaster, let's fight!" – he said "Cool, I'ma bitch-slap ya!"
Soon as he hopped out the cab
All you hear on the radio is "Dizaster, it's your dispatcher
Please go pick up Plex Rock and Lush One
And stay away from DNA, you know you don't bust guns
You never touched drugs a day in your life or touched none
And hurry up, your mom's calling, rents due, you must come!"
So when you squint your fuckin' eyebrows
And spit with alllll that aggression
I almost think you might really bust your Glock
But then again we saw him against Arsonal
And you ain't look too good with that fuckin' shot
You gon' try to rebuttal everything I say
Don't act like you fuckin' not, but it's cool
‘Cause a good rebuttal only means I had to say somethin' hot
So don't be confused when he rebuttal every lyric I say
And think he's clever with frees
‘Cause every time y'all cheer for that great rebuttal
You only givin' credit to me
Now you lost in the mix, got a bunch of hostages with him
He tried hoppin' the fence, it's an impossible mission
I'm camouflaged in the trenches
Ready to penetrate your army's defences
With these binocular lenses I have a prophet's vision
Is that the hardest kid in your clique? I got a problem with it
‘Cause I'm the motherfucker, I'm what your role model isn't
I'm the armed technician here to remodel your kitchen
With a bomb in it, the islamic edition
Part of your crib gone with the wind, shards of you missin'
Carvin' your rib, disarm the opposition
Then plant the pipe bomb in the car engine
And have Queen Latifah set it off from the distance
My job description: I split wigs like a salon beautician
That .38 is Special like your mom's condition
I know y'all have a problem with the retard jokes
But I only use them ‘cause he has something in common with them
‘Cause when he says he's flippin' to mingle
And he's letting the machete spray
It's not hard for us to see the retarded in him
I don't give a fuck if y'all wanna donate to autism
The truth is — cover your ears, Bishop — the truth is your mom's not even a good example of what being handicapped's about
‘Cause she's a master at that wheelchair
In that I wouldn't have a doubt
Most people, getting around when they're disabled
They find it hard, and you live in a massive house
But she uses the fucking hallways as interstate freeways
Where she gets off at the nearest living room exit
So she can take the fastest route
Weaving in and out of furniture traffic
She doesn't even scratch the couch
But she's kinda like you in a sense, ‘cause whenever she's stuck in a corner she's really good at backing out
Stop touching me! Y'all gon' make a rapping discovery
I don't even know how I can battle you so comfortably
I still can't even believe this faggot's in front of me
Everyday I wake up and I hit a blunt before I even wash my face up
Then I think about your genetic make-up
And how we can make up such a fake fuck
You pussy you duck hunt  you're getting duct-taped up
I'll kill every faggot in your city, I'll even fuck Mase up
About to get ran the fuck over over by a fucking one-way truck
You little fucking pussy! Your face is vaginal
Your mouth is like a vagina and in the center it has a hole
But fuck a camel though, you have enamel toe
It's Dizaster, you know I act like a crude jerk
Your attitude is past faggot, dude
You got a gap in your tooth, gagged and you yapped on your new shirt in your battle with Tsu Surf
I react, I'm rollin' fast, I let the tool burst
Kids will get hit in ass like the back of a Vatican school church
I take stacks off packages, this faggot don't move work
The only cleaning his gap out
Is the only time he digs up or actually do dirt
Two thirds of his life has been a root canal
Conceited influenced you in style
Everything you about to do he happened to do first
Your foundation is missing
Like the roof of your mouth, that is what you worth
I would slap this dude around
But the fact is life is already battling you worse
And that is reality, I know it's sad, but the tooth hurts
My teeth is missing and I got a face full of acne
When that steel flare
I bet all of these fans will cheer, like Drake in Degrassi
People are rappin', you must be kiddin' me
I'll do you like Pun, have you dead in the middle of little Italy
Thinkin' you can spit with me, you ain't hot as humidity
So why would y'all give him props
For mention my mom with a disability?
I'll go to your mom's house, come through, smack her hard
Come through, see her right quick, then I snatch that broad
Catch her right in the kitchen while she's eatin' caviar
And put that bitch in a wheelchair out the blue like the Avatar
And this the point, see somethin' somethin'
You think that you so nice, you little old clown
You rebuttal half lines, I damn near just rebuttal your whole round
This the point where I pin you down and have Organik hold you
Beat the shit outta you like your pops did when he disowned you
Give you the same treatment
That you did every time you was disloyal
But wait, before I do all that, I'ma expose you
Remember what you told Organik about King of the Dot?
"Your league is fucking shitty, bro
If you ain't gonna give us the help in promotion and gettin' dough
Then why the fuck you attach our logos
Against your bitch-ass videos?
Fuck King of the Dot! We technically invented you
GrindTime's the prototype, we do what you pretend to do
I will never respect this chump!"
Now you over here two years later? I guess time flies loud
‘Cause if you ain't notice
King of the Dot is shittin' on Grind Time Now
And your last three battles been in Canada
So this league basically made you, bitch!
And you disrespected them in a battle? You ungrateful bitch!
You a faggot, I'm just tryna figure out what made you switch
I guess Grind Time held you down and then raped you, bitch!
I couldn't wait to get in your face to tell you I hate you, bitch!
Flew all the way Canada
To put you in a wheelchair: Drake you, bitch!
They said DNA fell off, well, now I'm back — thank you, bitch!
But how's his pop rich and you say you struggle, dummy?
You take battles for free but gotta pay bills?
I guess you don't care about no fuckin' money
For a couple of pennies he'll be ready to travel
So it makes sense when you ate that sandwich versus SMP
‘Cause that's the only time you had bread in a battle
Then you disrespected Jin and his whole race
But I bet you if you seen him you'd probably switch sides
And dick ride and be pole-dancin'
You whine and cry about every battle, I bet you have a fit
That you don't get your way at your folks' mansion
So it makes sense why you hate Asians
‘Cause you always throw tantrums
And everybody knows that battle versus Locksmith
That one counted, ‘cause you showed you hated Asians more
‘Cause when you choked you looked dumbfounded
"But if that's too low, then turn the volume on your speakers up
Your rhymes is weak as fuck
Like the last time Redman and Method Man tried teamin' up."
And when he said that line versus Swave
At first I was like, "Woooh, damn, that's hot!"
Until Method Man co-signed you
And you just disrespected a legend who gave you props
And then if you talkin' like that, then of course he's frontin'
There ain't a course, I get him off for nothin'
This battle's six days after Halloween
It's ironic, ‘cause he already lost to Pumpkin
And he said, "In the MC book, when you fuck up you keep goin'."
And in the eyebrow book, you keep shavin' if they keep growin'
‘Cause I'ma keep it a hundred
My tooth's missin' and them eyebrows is real bushy
So King of the Dot, let's keep it a hundred
One of us is lyin' sayin' we get pussy
When I run up on Dizaster in New York with a Knick's hoodie
He'll back down and get scared and get mushy
Okay, I lied, I see one of us does get pussy
But why do you keep on talkin'
When you act like you know you off the heat?
Me, right now? Nigga please! I'm off the beat
I'll take your body off the concrete and throw it off the street
You got that dog chain on right now
But I'm the one that's off the leash
So why you keep rappin' like you be rappin' when it's dope
You a faggot, I'll clap it, then jack it like your coat
You told Swave you pop the 9, show him like Columbine
You think that you, Blood? Stop it, five!
They brought this yellow tape here
‘Cause Organik knew it was a homicide
So don't act like your raps is hot or you'll blast the Glock
Time's about to run out, you can have your knot
You have a problem with time
So you don't know how to stop on time when your raps is hot
But this Caliente will make you die before the aftershock
And I spray off clappers
That'll be the result of this battle if you spell the word radar backwards… goddamn it, it's still "radar" backwards!
Truth is, I'll break it down for y'all
Since your boy Cortez, a.k.a. José, won't explain this stuff
I was on the cell all day tryin' to set up this whole thang with Lush
While you in the background with him
Doing roleplay on the phone hangin' up
You think playin' with my money is funny, I'll blow this location up
And I won't leave until I make sure your face gets crushed
Add more flame, I turn your torso and face to dust
More flame, the propane take your soul, raise it up
And dislocatin' your shoulder bone from your rotator cuff
You smile like you don't use Colgate enough
Every couple of seconds when you're rappin'
Your nose face gets touched
Like your tryin' to point the way your cocaine is stuck
Or your just another faggot actor
Who thinks he's soulmates with Lux
But Lux is the man… Syke, you're both gay as fuck!
I'll rip Hollow's hand off
While it's still attached to his foam paper cup
It was, like, six in the morning
I saw you and your little sister Jennifer Cortez sit on the corner
Holdin' up a sign that said "For food we're willing to sit on a boner
Polish a ball sack and suck dick for a quarter."
And underneath it said "Please! All we had for dinner was yoghurt."
Your little Smack gimmick image here literally won't work
I bet Math used to punk you and make you finish his homework
This kid is like Conceited
Except he ended up hitting his growth spurt
Your boy Murder Ave doesn't even exist, it's not even a known turf
You guys are both nomads
The only home this ho has is literally his own shirt
Look at you rubbin' yourself tryin' to keep your composure
You ran away fuckin' Smack
Because the events they had were bigger and doper
Always bitchin' that Grind Time couldn't give you exposure
So you walked around for like six months
With a chip on your shoulder, before you decided to jump ship
Hoping to get you a little bit closer
But swiffed out on our interest
‘Cause you were the diva that was tippin' it over
And the sad part is all Smack had to do to bribe you
Was promise to put some rims on your stroller
They offered Cortez a new fisherman boat
So he doesn't have to swim to the border
And Hollow Da Don got a brand new Nintendo controller
People always said your boy Cortez looked like Pitbull
And even though he's the same identical poser
Now I believe he's a pitbull
Since I seen him switch up on his owners
Listen here, bitch, you have a listening disorder
Your mission is officially over
If you think you gon' beat me I'd rather hire Jin as my chauffeur
Yeah, I'm a F15 engine versus a 1960 Corolla
And you're missin' your motor
I'll run up in your crib with them soldiers while you're sippin' a soda
Catch you slippin', put you in submission and fold ya
Then jump up and put my kicks on your sofa
Like Tom Cruise did to Oprah
Yeah, what's going on, pussy?
It looks like that type of shit you cannot respond to
You said on the track 1.25 seconds on your song
About your dad gone that you never clapped a revolver
Yeah, remember? One minute, 25 seconds
You looked up to the light and screamed out
"I've never touched a drug or busted a gun in my life!"
You never clapped a revolver, I'll flat-line you
Snipe at your heart like the final boss you battle in Contra
So act like Manic, so act like Manic, I'll pop ya
Give me that deadly stare, I'll let it air
Leaving shells everywhere like Italian pasta
You roll with a pack of imposters
You don't wanna scrap, I'll pull a MAC and I'll sock ya
Get bitch slapped with the impact of A-Class crashin' his Honda
I'll strike you faster than the Black African Mamba
And send your body bag back to Rwanda
Battling me is worse off than sharing a bath tub with Blanka
Or getting a back rub massage from Mortal Kombat's Baraka
Your breath smells like asshole and cacka
You need to grab some Binaca
I'll backhand you and I will damage your chakra
The day you beat me is the day everyone in Canada considers Sno an actual Rasta
What you know about weed?
Your whole life you probably only seen two bags of ganja
I'm a YouTube superstar, everyday I have new fans
From Deutchland to Jakarta, from Buktan to Combala
Dominican Republic, and Yucads in Cabanas
Kuala lumpur and Sri Lanka down to Sudan and Uganda
But all you have is two fans: you're Kitana
I saw you wearing earrings that one day, fake-ass shits
Put on, probably put on, start wearing Prada
Instead of fucking worrying about what you wear
You should try and display some honour
You scared to come to California
Afraid I'll put them Grapes gangstas on ya
But every time you rap it's about how you bang your llamas
And how you give my brain caps and you be making trauma
And how your homies rolled around Vegas
And shut the whole baby down and start creating drama
But that doesn't make you crazy
That makes you like QP's baby mama
You never shot a gun in your life, like you said
Yeah, and that's the reason why I'm having major problems
With the way you were brought up
But it ain't your fault, that's why I blame Madonna
Come on, dawg, let's kick some facts and just be honest, huh?
You went to Smack, put up a stack and you peed on it
And that is a fact, I ain't gotta actually speak on it
Far as your Facebook statuses, the average is three comments
You leave today with a stash in your jeans pocket
Then I'm smackin' that green off it
And to add to that threat this MC's polished
Fuck what this faggot just said, I rapidly clap with that lead
And rip a patch up the back of your head like Rasheed Wallace
Your mom's fucking retarded, I mean it!
But it's not the same, ‘cause she's also a genius
She gives a lot of brain: she's a quadriplegic
I don't give a fuck about her eating problems
She can exercise some different feeding options
She can't use her hands, they shake
So if she wants to have some steak, she puts the knife between her toes and uses her retarded feet to chop them
But no matter how good she gets at holding the silverware
She always seems to drop them
And then stands back looking at 'em
Like, "If only I had longer reach like Dhalsim."
But I don't want no beef, your mom's a G from Compton
Any moment she might show up at King of the Dot
And get them heaters poppin'
So I better flee before she acts like Stephen and brings the hawk in
You rapped about your dad in the beginning
That's some shit I wasn't gonna say
But I'm an evil motherfucker, so all that shit you were talking about, I think that shit is gay
Yeah, I will fly him out of his casket and I'll slump the faggot
I'll fuck your mom in front of her and I'll soak the mattress
Then I'll throw the broken prophylactic on his open casket
I will forge a stack of boarding passes
Get on board a Concorde and crash it
Into an overpass during morning traffic
Who said that? Come on! Admit it, homie! Speak up, brother!
I'll go back there right now and I'll fuck your mother!
Callin' fuckin' Organik like he fuckin' owes you somethin'
Motherfucker doesn't owe you nothin'
‘Cause you don't know nothin' about strugglin'
Look at The Saurus and Illmac, yeah, look at The Saurus, cousin
They're battling for pride
If they lose today they're going home with nothin'
But you're too much of a pussy, a battle you won't go judgin'
You'd rather be a fuckin' homo and just vote on public
Yo, who the fuck is talking, bro? Yo, who's talking?
A'ight, I see you're offended because his mom is being brought up
Okay, that shit is some harsh stuff
But this is battling, what do you expect?
This is the type of shit that pops up
What? What?! Y'all fuckin' mad his mom is brought up?
I don't give a fuck if they have special needs
They got all types of foundations to get their guap up
I don't know about y'all, but
I've already donated enough money from my heart into that large cup sitting at the counter in every single Starbucks
Fuck you! Don't ever fuck up my battle!
I'll pick up your bitch and I'll hump her like my camel
Just think of this battle with the L.A. initials backwards
‘Cause that's what he's leaving with: a L
See, Diz, you wanna keep rappin' crazy
When you try to act like you flow like best
But you can't come through, nigga, I put a hole like chest
Now I ain't even come through to rap with it
I'ma show him how Smack and quick
Gon' dap this bitch after that I clap the clip
He keep movin' his head back until I smack it quick
You a faggot that I never come through and dap you, bitch!
I'll run up in your crib, real too, and smack it quick
And shoot him while he's writing with his pen
Now that's how you air a bic
And that was a half punchline, that ain't even the half of it
Now I'ma switch up and talk to this nigga in Arabic
Hedat, your family told me you're a maniak
There's a thousand words in the Arab dictionary
But my favorite one is Eddifat
Ella Stasi, ‘cause these dudes wanna keep talking with the clip
But after that I'm like "Pulla Misha Marka!"
‘Cause that means you're a bitch
And after that I'ma say "It's getting hot in here."
And Ik Fala Watchi! Y'all know what that means in Arabic
Get him the fuck outta here!
So why this dude acting up like he playing with me?
Oh, you thought we was in Canada
So they wouldn't say it with me?
Nigga, please! Why you play inside?
That slogan is like Boost Mobile, that shit's nationwide
So why you acting crazy with the best shell
These clips will make you sprint
Why you keep talking like you bet for sure?
Oh, you know about the hotels we in?
You on the 6th and I'm on the 7th floor
That's cool, nigga, so stay up
After I blast with the shell, I hate to leave him on the elevator
‘Cause he'll be going on his way up
So you keep rhyming, Diz
Keep spitting all these bars when I clap ya
Acting all hard, but see, you not a real dude, you just a actor
It doesn't matter what you say
‘Cause you're gay and you just a actor
You can't do what you do ‘cause, nigga please, I'm the pastor
‘Cause I got a question y'all: what's a disaster to a rapture?
He can't move it on that blink screen
You so stupid you can't do what the blinks, D
I kill him in fucking 7HD, a HD, come through
Turn his body soul, rip it apart and have it lookin' like gangrene
I'ma teach your old teacher stupid I make greenery
So after I do that when I spark fiends
Shoot him in his pockets with money
And you gon' see that wall green
And after I do that on a nice day, hit him with that nice tre
Then doctors and paramedics
Gon' be having to find the right aid
‘Cause I'll run up on that whip, when I'm steerin' now
I see that he's fearin' now, I clear the town
Bishop Brigante ratchets
I shoot it in your face and tear that mirror down
You clear the town when I'm offin' the dome
‘Cause right now, please nigga, frees, top of the dome
I come through—fuck that!
But after I shoot I'ma have to off his top, like Charron
And he keep thinking he coming praisin' when you on that
You acting like you can freestyle
And rhyme, nigga, like you move on that
You say that you like rhyming nerdy
But I don't get it when you cool on raps
‘Cause every battle you have with a street rapper
You talk about guns like you on Smack
So, Diz, how does that make sense, when it's so lovely?
You said that you didn't shit on King of the Dot
And now it's so lovely
Now you gon' try here get in my face and try to punk me
So let's break it down
On exactly what he said about this country
Nigga, who are you airin'?
You just stand six feet tall and didn't do shit
Nigga, who are you scarin'?
Like, what's wrong with this dude?
I had to tell him five times and maybe one time?
Like, we know, you know, we both freestylers
So why would you do that? So I can make a punchline?
Like, I don't get it when I blam it
Now back to what I was talking 'bout with Organik
Like I said, right? This dude gon' act like he's on his grown shit
When I mentioned King of the Dot, you should've said something, but since you didn't I'ma rebuttal your own shit
Like when I said you disrespected King of the Dot
And that was lovely, then you should've replied
Well, then Organik disrespected our country
And that's when I would've told you
I'm disrepectful for spittin' in your face
But I got more respect for Organik
‘Cause at least he did it in our face
And you pussy, you never hold the 9 and spray
Like when you said "Canadians are faggots!"
"Canadians are faggots!"—you did that shit miles away
So now that we here in Canada
And you said they have no military, they have no healthcare
And Canadians are faggots—say it again, Diz!
(Diz: DNA's a faggot!)
No, say it again, Diz, about Canada!
(Diz: Canadians are faggots! Boo)
Diz, what's going on here? Things startin' to change
You see you're on your way now
You heard all them boos, you kinda looking like me on 8 Mile
But now he acting crazy when he's poppin' it nice
You tried to talk about me with Eminem droppin' the mic
But you think it's all cool, somethin' somethin', the best in?
Well, you just booed in front of the same presence
In front of a worldwide legend
So, like I said, say Canadians are faggots again!
Repeat that! Exactly my point
He ain't do it this time, because, to me, I mean that
So why he keep acting crazy?
Acting like he all tough blammin' a razor
I just came to King of the Dot
And got rid of Dizaster—I'm Canada's savior!
Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up North
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen
I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?"
It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snowin'
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow
Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
Then she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"
Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!
Yeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, it's what it is
And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
When we were together it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
(give me a second to gather my thoughts)
And watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)
(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)
Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)
(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)
I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
But this Summer is different it's a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
We'll never talk again, scary and true
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified
It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
My name is Drizzy, and I ain't perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it
But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it
You could show up at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids
Of you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed
With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin', screamin'
Yeah, oh, nah, I'm ready
Yeah, let's go
Your girlfriend at my next show, OVOXO, nigga
Haha, yeah
Uh, what's up?
Real nigga doin' real stuff
Get a lot of money, you can never get enough
And you know the new shit sound so tough
So-and-so just walked in, so what?
I don't really vibe with a lot of these niggas
I ain't really into givin' more than one chance
Girl, I already tried with a lot of these niggas, fuck that
That team don't know real, what's that?
That can't be from here
That can't be what they believin' is the best shit of the year
That's that fake shit, that's that fake shit, that's that top row of veneers
Just when they gettin' impatient's when I make it world premier
Aww, damn, word, award shows coming?
Make sure you spell the shit right
Make sure to gimme all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff's still in that Sprite
They watch us, make the shit into a song
You ain't living that boy, stop stealin' that light
Anything can happen when I do see y'all
Guess it all depends how I'm feelin' that night, okay
Live my life in hotels, bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend, bitch better have my tomb right, ahh
This is perfect for the women that I've loved before
I love 'em all, I just love me more, huh
All right
It's a celebration clap, clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of Moscato
For the girl who's a student and the friend who's a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl, you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it
Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself
Okay...
There comes a time...
When you gotta be like
You know, I've come this far on my own, done a lot for myself
Where to now, you know?
But I just—I just tell myself this one thing
It was worth it, it was all worth it
And by this time, I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit, but they served they purpose
And I got verses, I got verses
My sixteens should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied, you see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah, Heartbreak Drake, I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse, then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced
And tryna make all my goals for the future come overnight
Go—Go—Go—Goddamn, how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over, watch a season of Flight of the Conchords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But ugh, tell me you surfing, let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured
Yes, I swear to God, girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Fords
Ethiopian girl, Ethiopian girl
With your long, curly hair and yo' big ass boo-tay
Reading all them pro-Black, pro-female books
Just let 'em, let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription, a vision correction
I'm young and successful, I'm living perfection
And man, if '09 is when I'ma see mine
Being cool ain't enough, homie; I'ma freeze time, like that!
If you gettin money, if you gettin money
If you gettin money, just throw it in the bag
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
I said if you gettin money, if you gettin money
If you gettin money, just throw it in the bag
Well alright
Loso, and Drizzy baby
Uh uh, we up in Barneys goin dumb again
Every time we leave the manager say "come again"
Honestly she's probably old enough to be my mama friend
She just want that feeling back, I make her feel young again
If her card declined, you need to check that shit and run again
They don't give you limits when you keep that money comin in
Yeah, just fold some paper around the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car then she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband 'til she found out that he cheats
And then she filed for divorce and watch her bank account increase
She got a condo with a view, a house with a pool
Her son is 26 but he just went away to school
She always show me pictures of him, tell me that's her baby
I hope that I never meet him, that nigga look craaaaazy
And I be spendin all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in '86
Yeah, she say she lucky that she his
No, I'm lucky that you mine baby, you know what it isssss
Shorty so nice, I don't mean polite
When I say nice, I mean lookin right
And you can't put a price on something lookin right
If they ask how much, tell em what it's lookin like
Everything I buy fly, it's like I'm bookin flights
If I want it, I'm a get it, that should not be tooken light
And that's on everything I got a crazy lady
So Money Ain't A Thang Jay-Z, J.D
Like Jay-Z's lady, it's Beyoncein
Supportin your women goes beyond payin
Watchin me ball is like LeBRON playin

Can't believe that I just met you
You got me here
Watching minutes past by
Wondering when to expect you

Looking like every picture

Now that it's over

Then you think this is real and
You could be mine

Slowed it down cause I feel

Maybe it's just nothing at all
But this could be something

This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me

Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy
Yo, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
Yeah, I got twenty damn Kendalls (Twenty, ayy, I got twenty damn, ayy)
Young slim baddies and they en vogue (Twenty, twenty, I got)
Yeah, I got twenty fuckin' Gigis
Yeah, they drink three litres of Fiji
Yeah, Pluto, he just spilt a sumo with me, now I'm sideways
I could park a hundred Escalades in my driveway
They be rockin' ice but then they talkin' like it's Friday
Next nigga to call me out, I'm goin' on a tirade (Yeah)
Yeah, my birthday in the 6ix gon' be a holiday
I say I need a table for like thirty, they accommodate
Take her from Dominican and make that shawty immigrate
I'm a headache to society
Real shit, Kylie Jenner, that's a side piece
I got twenty mothafuckin' Kylies
Nigga, I got twenty damn Kylies
Ugh, 'kay, I told you, "Catch up"—did you make a mil' yet?
I can't predict how many of them I can still get
October's Own is such a fucking real set
No tats, but the ink on my money still wet
Life is such a beach; it's sandy all around me
I came here with Young Money, man, that's family all around me
I'm in my living room, and I got Grammys all around me
And famous bitches doing nose candy all around me
Welcome to the life, the life that's meant for me
My Bentley has a tint, and so you got to squint to see
I hollered at your girl; that's when she went with me
But please don't blame yourself, 'cause it just wasn't meant to be
They say I'm one of the illest; that's just off a first impression
And my cards always accepted, I don't deal well with rejection
I look in the dictionary and don't see the word "recession"
I don't smoke in public, but tonight, I'll make an exception, so just—
First time I saw you, I wasn't thinking of you and I
I was just thinking of I
First time we fucked was at my place, it was a couple years late
But it was fate and I think you feel good about it
So now we end up in this place we both hate
And I think it takes a sacrifice
Not fair, it's not right, it's impractical
For you to leave that man and come and just be mine
Try, you won't even try
It's simple, it's simple
Vai, rebola pro pai, novinha, vai (Vai)
Descendo (Vai), descendo
Vai, rebola pro pai, vai, novinha, vai (Vai)
Descendo (Vai), descendo
Vai, rebola pro pai, novinha, vai (Vai)
Descendo (Vai), descendo
I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
These days
I've met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think
About how I have failed
To change all of my ways
These days
Yeah, I had a lover
Don't think I'd risk another
These days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life I've made in songs
These days
I've stopped the dreaming
I don't do too much scheming
These days
These days
I sit inside a chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars
These days
These days
I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryin' to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back, keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, that's precisely what I mean
And dog, it's forever clear, my money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work, that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And whose Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it, I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pendant
You ain't livin', rapper, you never have been
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire, and gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer, I did it prior
I've shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
And I am, present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, "Is that a rose?"
"You mean Rosé? Why yes it is"
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style, you're in need of ya own, man
I’m performing tonight you know that shit gone be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that it’s exact
My ex girl’ll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though, this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing ID
But the young trendsetting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring your Mrs by me
I’m it I’m it call me Mr. IT
If I get one wish I'ma wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like Ms. Arie and I do
The realest in my age group, no shit
SoHo, Cosmo, Balmain blow fish
Let's make a toast, tell your friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner
Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It’s about time that you made it
I was bumping your songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beats in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can’t sign nothing 'til my lawyer get the facts and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murray look at what my talent did
And what your business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it’s not about who you know
It’s just how you balance it
It’s always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you coming the hardest
It's how you start actin' when nobody can reach you
My plan just hatched, happy easter
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner
Uhh, ok I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in your starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A lot of people sayin' fuck me
Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck Ts
And I never trust a nigga saying trust me
Nick cannon and will never did it this ill
So you tell the house band don’t you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon' live it up
Thanks to Uncle Steve, my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us
And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn’t leave you out, you forever in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Sher
I’ll forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel, I hope heaven’s prepared for whenever you there
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through your stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motherfucking Mario
Yeah and Polo isn’t at my session
Mr.Anticipation keeping everybody guessing like
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner
Yeah
I been waiting on this one Charlie, for real
I've been waitin' Driz
I've been waitin', let's get 'em bro
Nah, for real
Shout out Boi-1da too
Mm, I like that
Let's get 'em Driz
You don't have a drink, you're not drinking or what?
I got a drink bro
Hahahaha, I like that
I got my drink right here. Cheers my bro
Toast up man
Yeah, okay, yeah
Goldman Sachs, they wanna hold my racks
Hedge fund investors talk to Adel like he the expert
I hear it in they tone when they address him
We way too connected
Tom Ford assistant texted asking if I want classic or double breasted
I flex with broad shoulders
When I walk through the halls they move over
Stories of how we handle ours start to travel like a lone soldier
I told you
You hold your girl the same way that I hold composure
Or hold the wheel of the Fuji white Rover
Silverstein dinners, all kosher
Never rushin'
My niggas really made somethin' from nothin'
Dodge sentences like they don't wanna discuss it, change subject
Got the Benny Yang chains rubbin', never tucked in
Waiting to inhale
Things that I own will sell at auction as proof we did well
My house museum-scale
The only skeletons here are the ones from the nights I raised hell
Make sure the staff are paid well
Make 'em think twice 'bout the stories that they tell
No one knows when the plan is hatchin'
I'ma let 'em walk on eggshells
Tiptoe, niggas better know
Wow, man like Drizzy Drake!
Yeah
Got his foot on your neck man
What time is it? What time is it? It's like two in the morning right now
Yeah, well it's real late over here
It's me and Charlie, that's it, you hear me? We got the whole building to ourselves
We got the building. Kill them again, kill them again Driz, kill them!
Y'all keepin' the score while watchin' me score
Y'all keep the awards, I'll take the rewards
If y'all goin' for fun, I'll stay and record
But if y'all goin' to war I'm there for sure
Wouldn't miss it
I'm living next to Michael, Bobby, Ralph, Johnny
My neighbors soundin' like New Edition
That's these guys
Us guys don't wear New Balance or Levi's
Key West retirement plan
Grippin' the Callaway club in my hand
Hittin' balls off of the balcony into the sand
Tryna see where they land
October Firm the new chain of command
El chico, this verse is the explanation for the large ego
100 mill' hands free like Ronaldinho
I go from Star to Venetian in a small speedboat with girls we know
Take your pick, Brooke or Tanya
Both those shorties'd leave their GPS on so I can find ya
Drop location
Spring break trips, I'm in hot rotation
I took a lot of my brothers from B and E licks or the pot rotation
To ridin' shotgun in a Picasso painting
Tricks up sleeves, have 'em playin' innocent to get the shits I need
Loyalty is priceless to me and this I see
Before I ever seen this shit tatted on P and tatted on C and tatted on me
I speak truth and get to shatterin' dreams
So it's best to tiptoe, niggas better know, yeah
Drizzy Drake! You're an animal Drake! You already know that you an animal bruh! Animal!
I'm saucy!
Saucy! You just stepped out of the club straight into the booth like it's light. Tear up the ting in one take!
Showed up for you, you know what I'm sayin'?
My brother Drizzy
My brother, you already know
Wow. And you know what it's like. You stepped out the club into the booth to prove to everyone why you number one bro. Why you got your foot on their necks!
Nah for real. I stepped in here, SN1, OVO, Fire in the Booth, Charlie Sloth. Come on. The official. I rock with the official. I'm on official ting, you know what it is man. Come on, come on
Ayy bro, it feels like that's another moment there, you know what? Like, I got to say this to you on the real bro. The way that you've embraced British culture will be remembered forever. And the UK love you. The real G's over here, you know that bro. When you go to your parties, you see who's in your parties
Nah, you know what it is, of course
It's the certies
Nah, listen, but listen. It's a family and it's a big family, you know what it is. I'm just happy to be home, like I said man
My brother, man. Foot on neck time
Yo, are these guys dumb? You see the big man Charlie too, oh my goodness
My brother Drizzy. I can hear these rappers' prayers man
Nah, I'm heated for you right now
They're like, "Yo, please tell Drizzy to take his foot off my neck!"
Nah, I'm heated right now man, oh my goodness. Shout out French Montana, my brother, you know what I'm sayin'? The big wave, yeah. Shout out Huncho, Quavo. Shout out Offset, blessings on the new ting. Oh my goodness. Shout out, yo–. I could go for hours. Charlie, come on man
Ayy, you could go for hours. I was at your party the other night, I've seen who was there. I'm like, "Woah!" There's a lot of people, there was a lot of faces in that party
Nah, I don't wanna hear no chat for the whole 18 about Charlie Sloth. Are you dumb? Alright. Jheeze, jheeze
And that right there: one take. A real moment right there
Yeah, jhee!

Come on! You know I've applied for your passport, right?
Hahaha. I need that
Low-key Peter Parker flow
Tell her bring some Ace of Spades no sparklers though
Private flights no hassle I just park and go
I’m the highlight like when markers glow
Oooooh, look what you created
Only got yourself to blame, I remember when you hated ooooh
Now you tell me take my time
How bout I just take your city make that muthaf-cker mine uh ha
I’m a underground king ho, I sit tall, I swang low
The game ain't always fair and thats the thing though
You can play your heart out everyone don’t get a ring though
You are in the presence of a champion
Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in
You always be calling her, she ain’t never answering
You ain’t figured out I am the reason that she canceling
I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can’t come in
Call me Ron Burgundy y'all the other anchormen
Whats on the news trick, gossiping bout music
Cause rumours I’m the new shit and guess what it’s true bitch
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
I feel like we made it
But we ain't made enough
It's so amazing
You woulda thought we made it up
Man I was made to be greater
Made for the grind
Made for the lights
Made for the shine
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down

Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down (Yeah, ugh)
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Round! I gotta hundred girls in each phone
Drizzy Drake, mayne—Young Sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home
Homesick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losing track of time, every day, we switchin' zones
Drizzy Hendrix, I'm just backstage getting stoned
Thank Me Later, man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard, nigga; I'm quoted more, nigga
Results are in, I guess you should've voted more, nigga
Swimming in the money, y'all just float ashore, nigga
Never drowning, what the fuck you think this boat is for, nigga?
Yeah, I'm quick to take a R&B diva out
I bring some friends
She bring some friends that know what we about
And when it's done, I put my slippers on and see 'em out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
But I'm just really tryna keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, see just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler, every day I'm riding clean, damn!
Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I

Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Legendary, love you so much it's unnecessary
Like it's always two weeks into February
You can take that shit to the cemetery, til we're dead and buried
But girl God forbid I feel too alive
Around you I got too much pride
Do we let it breathe or put a title on it?
I'm so indecisive, I'll let you decide
She like nah seem like your chakra's off
I'm like nah it's just that your top is off
And I started out wantin' to talk to you
And now all I can think about is poppin' off
Girl you're all that matters
You in bra and panties, that's automatic
You straddled me, I started fallin' backwards
Don't worry about the phone you can call them after
Bout to take ya down
Yeah
You need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
You got a lot on your shoulders
Listen to me 'cause I'm older
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential, I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it if it's too soon
But you need to get done, done, done, done
At work, come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
More blue dot, more champagne (Pour it)
More good love to heal our pain (Do it)
Things haven't been the same
You need to forward and give me all the work
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing
Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go whether that's right I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came -
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back
Shake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
And homie, you ain't even on my altitude
I'm tellin you, I got enough cloud for two
And like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
They like, "Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?"
On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
I'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
These other rappers lukewarm like red wine
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
I'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
Every city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
I miss cake these days
I can't even afford a mistake these days
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days
Please don't take offense to my ways
Cause I need drug money Who got drug money?
I am talkin "white Phantom sittin' on dub" money
I am talkin "cold champagne at the club" money
And no I ain't emotional, but baby I love money
To all these A&R's that's playin' stars
Why you gotta act dumb? (dumb)
Your girl know how I beat it like a flat drum
And spit dirty like I'm chewing on black gum
I fooled y'all, ain't shit for me to come back from
Oh! Yes!
I'd like to take this opportunity
To formally welcome you to this extravaganza
That I call Comeback Season
Hope you enjoy your stay
Drinks are on me, by the way, yeah
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus, I go, yeah
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise
Shout out to 40-40
Yeah my right hand!
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
Yeah, I had to do this shit for my little brother Mar
Young nigga just wanna hear me talk that Toronto shit, you know?
You see bad bitches and fall in love
I be talking arithmetic in the club, re-negotiations
Young Frank
I seen all of your favorite girls naked
And mental pictures were taken, I never forget they faces
They're lucky I can't draw, but still I'm artistic
Money on the way It's got both of my palms itching
You boys in the wrong business, for real
You boys in the wrong business
All this sitting back and watching will make you a strong witness
Testify on how I'm living, make sure it's non-fiction
Don’t leave out anybody that put me in this position
We couldn’t have done it better
We changed this city forever
Puffin shisha, lay back fucking with FIFA
What I get for the feature I wouldn't fuck with me either for real
Now I'm in it for the hoes and the checks
Care less about respect from niggas I never met
Champagne
I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She used to be a Christian before
Now, all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like, "Baby, those are cute, I adore those"
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understand the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash-only transactions, homie
And please, no receipts—the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dont know I bought it
Been doing it for years, homie; thoroughly, I thought it...
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track
Admitting most of my currency’s imported
But too late now, it's too legitimate to hit 'em with...
A lawsuit, even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker playing in the whip
As they pull me over, "my sweet surrender"
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A Menschkeit, as they say; he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present, every regal member
The coalition is so efficient
You have to be invited, or there's no admission
We know tradition, we spend money
So don't try to compete if you in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Used to record in the basement that Renny grew his piff in
When Pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen
'Til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team-playing, no screen-setting
"Because I wanna win games, Coach, I'm through assisting"
The takeover, the break's over, nigga
And I'ma keep killing 'em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshitting, but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality, so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumping
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant
'Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinking what I could've done to make my first video groundbreaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from talking 'bout the D I'm throwing in your wife
I treat this one session as if it were my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life, like that!
Yeah
Yo, it's the Aphilliates, nigga, pay attention!
Nicki Minaj, Young Money
Yeah
Drizzy's home, baby
Holiday Season!
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)

Know you got a roommate, call me when its no one there
Put the key under the mat, and you know I'll be over there (Yup!)
I'll be over there, shawty I'll be over there
I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there
Ha! And you ain't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chilling with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm working, I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one to never get confused with, 'cause...
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
I say you the fucking...
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything, other niggas never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
That's why I hold you down, every time you hit me up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
I make you beg for it, until I give it up
You say the same thing, every single time
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
I say you the fucking...
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee, 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double-cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix? Then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the back, and make your fucking bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots
I'm saying!
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon live it up
She make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the fucking best (Ayy), you the fucking best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Best I ever had (Best I ever), best I ever had (Best I ever)
Ugh!
Aww, yeah! (Aww, yeah)
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
(This is...)
Just make sure they that special somebody (NSA)
Young Money! (...Baby!)
Yeah
Yeah
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
'Cause ever since I left the city
(Late night when you need my love)
(Call me on my cell phone)
(I know when that hotline bling)
(That could only mean one thing)
(I know when that hotline bling)
(That could only mean one thing)
I said now what it is, what it do, homegirl ain't got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up, flip it down, weigh it up, break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who’s ya daddy now
Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Now she's my ride or die, it’s us against the world
You know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
Said I must've had too much to drink I’m in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause it’s the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you’ll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you’ll ring the alarm
And everytime you give it to me it’s gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets you’re gon’ be my lucky charm
I do, I do, I do, I do
Unh, Please put away the cameras
Cause we just in the club getting MC Hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor
And I know I'm just a boy that a woman could make a man of
So make me one, I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when she's 81
Please don't give it all away, I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around, there more jaded that they become
But this one special, so I make sure my suit will fit
The one my daddy wore in June of '85, I'm too legit
I'm just tryna get her in the mood
And having her doing all the things she'd only do when she get married
So let's do this shit
Tell the reverend, all we missing is his blessing
Because before she popped the pussy, she need me to pop the question
So we exchanged vows, they clapped, we take a bow
And she'll be doing tricks for daddy, when we take it to the house...
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, hey there, help me
I've been away too long and I know you'd agree
I'm so tired, but I can't sleep
My door's open and that don't mean leave
Know what I mean?
You know I gotta ask—
What's up with the friends that you bring?
Know you got some other cool friends that you never bring
New stories for you every time the phone ring
They don't understand, girl if anything you're everything
Oh lord, good lord, smoke a little, then record
You know Papi on the vocals, 40 on the boards
Call me when you feel inspired, never when you're bored
And have a real conversation with your fuckin' boy
With the fuckin' man, Mr. Lover-Lover-Man
How come everything is always on the other hand?
How come you ain't never busy when I'm busy
But the moment that I'm free
You always end up with some other plans?
How you make a good dude wait so long?
I don't understand why, that's some girl shit
And what you doin' in the bedroom with your clothes on?
I want you wearin' what you came into the world with
You've been home for three whole days
Actin' like you got chores to do
Boy this house is way too clean
I don't think there's nothing more to do
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong
You was still you before she ever came along
Get over it, get over it
I mean I understand the pain
Someone did me the same
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth
I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight
Cause you might just meet me
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me

So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2, Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2
How'd I do? How'd I do?
Baby tell me how you feel
They say real girls ain't never perfect
Perfect girls ain't real
I'd agree but I guess we'll just wait and see
'Cause I swear you act like perfect is the only way to be
N-N-Nothing matters 'cept for you
Don't let no one out here blind you
Don't remember why you love me
Please allow me to remind you
And I know you left me once
But I came right back to find you
Even though I like being in your past
You got a bright future behind you
Oh, damn, oh
Girl I must admit I look amazing next to you
Girl you crazy, sexy, cool
And you stayed obsessed with school
But that's good
Cause you know that them grades impress me too
And my free days are just for you
But I don't get many
It's like every time we spend time
It feels like the first time
'Cause we never spend enough time
You catch me at the worst time
It ain't like you're not worth time
Just I don't control it
But tonight I made it happen, just to celebrate the moment
Give it up one time
Give it up one time
One time
Ce-Ce-Celebrate the moment
Give it up one time
I don't care what you done, I don't care where you been
All you got do to is look over your shoulder
And look where God has walked you from
All you gotta do is look back
Just somebody look over your shoulder
Look where you come from, look where you come through
I come through the storms and rain
Look where I come from, I was down but now I'm up
Look where I come from, by the grace of God
By the goodness of God, look where I come from
Remind me where I'm from again (6ix)
Yeah, that's right, that's right
Tryna suppress the stress, you know?
Got a family tree that needs watering
A father that needs fathering
A mom that would probably prefer the whole mother-daughter thing, but we still rolling, you know?
Flipping my phone, soon as I wake
They callin' my name, just another day
Can't bend, can't break
Can't let it show on my face
All of my mistakes, right there on display
All part of my story, skin thick as my shawty, yeah (Too thick shawty)
Flipping my phone, soon as I wake
Is everybody safe? Carrying the weight
Tell me what it takes to get everybody straight
The money in my safe, can't buy a clean slate
Clean isn't for me anyway
I don't want you to allow people to tell you that you are useless
Alright, alright, go ahead and tell 'em, go ahead and tell 'em
Because I want you to know, God told me to tell you this day "You are useful" (Tell 'em, tell 'em)
You are valuable (Yes), and you are vital (Yes), to God
Vital, vital, on baby, on Bible
Remember what I left when I go
Remember what I said when I spoke
Please don't stand at my grave and cry though
I'm not there, they made it so I can never really die though
So please don't stand at my grave and cry though
Pop champagne, scream my words
Let me leave on a high note
And don't let nobody call me an idol
'Cause I was never sitting idle
And my people go where I go
Don't let nobody sell my house on the bridle
Worked too hard for the title
Worked too hard, where did life go?
Last thing I heard was Andre scream "Ice cold"
Past eight years feel like I had my eyes closed, blindfolded
Smoke before I make my decisions
That's how I take the high road
Say I never get alone time, that's a lie though
I'm still alone with everybody as far as I know
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
You know my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, get the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, weed blowin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city
Need proof, ask your girl's titties, she on the right side
SSL on the left, saying we the best
She wants to be friends with the crew
Take a lot of pics and travel where we move
Model on stage while I'm singing in her ear
20,000 fans get jealous up in here
They don't even care, girl, give it a rest
Ain't no fucking pussy gonna stick out from the rest
Girls with big breasts ain't shit without legs
'Least in my books so put me through this test, so I could care less
Penelope Cruz, Natalie Portman, please holla at your dude
Used to rap blues for the girls with tattoos
Used to rap blues for the girls with tattoos
Don't you forget it, girls like Gia, girls with no visas
Addicted to the life, french girls named Mia
'Cause my chick might be the next Keira Knightley
So baby, you can talk if you want, talk if you want
Talk if you want, talk if you want
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Previously on Ready To Die
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta 42 on the flights I'm takin'
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Never had a lot, this is all I need
Lost individuals is all I see
Grab the top spot like pardon my reach
Woke up one day and it was all on me
If it comes down, it's gon' fall on me
Lotta 42 on the flights I'm takin'
Long way down from the heights I'm chasin'
Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas
Girls checkin' in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous
Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turnin' off my phone for the night now, baby
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Some of my niggas don't love me
We should sit down before shit turns ugly
We should sit down since you said things about me
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way
Lotta 42 on the flights I'm takin'
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
Never had a lot, this is all I need
People never care 'til it's R.I.P
Niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
You should slide through and get your back broke
Used to be involved with me with no emotion
I was on the way to the next show
You was on the phone and you were so open
Heard you said you're over me, is that so?
You don't ever filter girl and that's okay
Coulda held on but you let it go
Sayin' to yourself that it's better this way
Funny thing is that you're going to need me and I know
You should slide through and get your back broke
Funny thing is that you're going to need me and I know
You should slide through and get your back broke
Feelings I've been stackin' like a bankroll
I should probably find a way to let it go
Wonder what it was that turned you this cold
Said you left me jaded and I wasn't joking
Miss the way it was a couple years ago
Back when we was young and now you've outgrown me
Hard to just accept I was a steppin' stone
Way that people talk about you I should've known
You're going to need me and I know
You should slide through and get your back broke
Funny thing is that you're going to need me and I know
You should slide through and get your back broke
Listen, girl
You so bad and you single, what's this I hear?
We ain't met yet, my name Drake
And I'ma take the world over, this my year
This I swear
Had my share of women that I been with
I'm young, can ya blame me?
I know you feel like a lot of things off-limits
At least let me describe what it can be
Be faithful, I'll do that
Nah, really, baby girl, I'll do that
'Cause everybody break up when they cake up
We can be the couple that'll never go through that
Yeah and if we ever fallin' off
I swear I'll remind you that
That we're not who they are
Now all I really gotta do is find you
Where you at?
Tell me how to locate you
I know satellites all breakthrough
But they don't ever lead me straight to
And I gotta arrive 'fore somebody take you
Know there's someone you don't mean a lot to
And he would hate to know that I got you
I even got a speech in my head
That I write and recite at the moment I spot you
"Hey there, your name is?
I like that, it suits ya
I'm young, but different
I'm not what you're used to at all"
If we stop at the same red light
I'ma celebrate the fact that I found you, girl
And I'ma ride for you too, as soon as it turn green
Wanna hear from my ladies all around the world
Where you at?
Yeah
Fallin' in love really ain't for me
Pourin' it up, so I feel nothing
But I still can't sleep, niggas can't compete
You got it, babe, you got it (Yeah)
You got it, babe, you got it
Real ass nigga got a bag, I know you spendin'
Rolls-Royce truck you whippin', fuck a Benzy
Pull up with me, we gon' start a frenzy
We don't ever play it safe, we 'bout to send it
Know we gonna fuck each other, quit pretendin'
Choosin' up, keep these other bitches pendin'
I'ma stick with the tequila, you want Henny
Got me all over your face like Fenty, yeah
You got it, babe, you got it
You got it, babe, you got it
Tell me why you're out here messin' with these lame hoes
They ain’t bringin' nothin' to the table
You and me was meant to be, I know you'd say so
Babe, you know, you got it, babe, you got it (Oooooh)
You got it, babe, you got it (Ooooh-ohhh)
I don't wanna play no games, play no games

That's okay 'cause, baby, you..
You got it, babe, you got it (Yeah)
You got it, babe, you got it
You're the only one I've ever been in love with
It's so damn crazy
Got me picturin' havin' your baby
Missin' out on us would be a shame
Tell these other bitches who you 'bout to claim
You got it, babe, you got it (You got it, you got it)
You got it, babe, you got it (Ooooh-ohhh)
I don't wanna play no games, play no games (Games)
Fuck around, gimme your last name (Last name)
Know you tired of the same damn thing
That's okay 'cause, baby, you..
You got it, babe, you got it (You got it, ohh)
You got it, babe, you got it (You got it, ohhhh)
A nigga got a woosah

Flip modes on ya quick, got a few sides
Comin' from the 6 side
Where niggas goin' Shower Posse just to get by
Stay true never switch sides, yeah
The game turn me into this guy, yeah
And now every time Drake out
Cameras always flashing tryna put me on the takeout
Crib in Calabasas man I call that shit the safe house
Thirty minutes from L.A the shit is way out
But these days, that's where I'm stayin'
You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in
Yea, OB dat my brother like a Wayans
Ya know I only show up if you payin' , nigga

For like the five past years

Old soul livin' in a past life here, mayne
You, bring the cash right here, mayne
Miracles, sit your ass right here, mayne

That's why I get it first and you get it late
Yeah, OVO sound, man, that's every day

Trendsetter, Ben Frank getter (Yeah)
Whip whatever, whip whatever

When I apply it, shit don’t ever let up, yeah
Look, I'm in the cut, The Boy in the cut
Jump in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up
All of this grindin' for what?
It’s funny when you niggas thought it was luck
I cannot give you a pass if you play with my money and family and friends
And I compete with myself while you niggas competin' with trends
Your foreign is used, I looked up the VIN
I know the truth, no use in pretendin' with him
Still in the cut, The Boy in the cut
Hop in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up
Still in the cut, The Boy in the cut, yeah
Hop in the whip where the ceilings go up, we up

Everybody knows and I feel left out

(Sonorous on the beat)
And I know
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, don't wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, that's a sad story, yeah, real bad karma
Condo in Miami, sold that shit to Chalmers
I stay on the beach when I retire
I can't miss a game, I been on fire
I'm thinkin' money when I sleep now
That's the only thing that get me geeked now
Someone got a problem every week now
Oh, now, they talkin' beefs, now
Gotta make peace and stay a hunnid (Stay a hunnid)
All my girls bad, times a hunnid (Times a hunnid)
And I'm going hard, times a hunnid (Times a hunnid)
I'm tryna see a hunnid, times a hunnid
For the guys, for the city and the gang
I might appear if you keep calling on my name
Put a curse up on you, things are getting strange
You ain't lie when you told me that I changed
And I know
(Sonorous on the beat)
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, don't wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, that's a sad story, yeah, real bad karma
My life is full of drama
I just want the top, don't wanna charm her
Talk about the boy and you get karma
Bad karma, that's a sad story
(Sonorous on the beat)
(Dramatic, nigga!)
Well, alright, here I go
I'm a rapper turned singer, and you can tell that he smoke
But I don't need my vocal chords, all I hit is c-notes
N.E.R.D. flow, I spaz if I'm pre-voked
I'm about to change the fuckin' game, pass the remote
Money is everything, and it's every other thing
I'm part of the choir, that's the motto that my brother sing
Cash is the right now, women are post game
MoneyOverBitches dot com, check the domain
It's comin' too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say, "Yeah, once in a blue moon"
Oops, I mean a red moon, I did it again, Tune
Let me leave a space in for your Blood affiliation, I state
Heavy metaphors, flow so overweight
I could rap around these other young'ns like a cobra snake
Frostbite Drizzy, nigga, nobody as cold as Drake
Keep your ass in-line, don't be tryna to roller skate
Fuck all the discrete shit, I get on some deep shit
I am 21, tell me, who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you could tell I'm real
Cause I'm gettin' hood love and I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young Angel, Young Lion, I'm done tryin'
I'm just doin', who's drinkin'? cause I'm buyin'
It's on me, everything is on me
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin' Jon B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listened back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This for all the strippers 'cause I know that they gone bump it
Tell 'em "Back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it"
Ain't no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back-and-forth faxes
My money coming full circle, get up on my axis
Maybe I'ma kill 'em, only 'cause I promised
They think I'm bein' cocky, but I'm only bein' honest
I'm swallowin' the Goose, got a model gettin' loose
And I never party 'less I got some bottles in the booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this
I'm just havin' patience, cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness, Drizzy
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, look the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, "I expected this"
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protegé, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy
It's Drake (Oh)
VO (Yeah)
Amir (Hmm)
Hahaha, Voyce talk to 'em, man
Ladies up north represent representing
Ladies down south represent representing
When the mic is in my hand I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was Eric B For President, it's evident
She spend her summers in Jamaica and I love that
They say that she should be a model she's above that
She had a rapper break her heart, had to open her
So she don't even mess with rap, only spoken word
Well, I'm a poet so you know it's get her to going down
And after all this is my city I could show you round
I understand that the shit you facing is crazy
Let me hear your views on the situations in Haiti
Or sit back relax, vibe with ya man
Chill we could talk about Tribes in Sudan
'Cause you gotta understand if I said it then I meant it
I understand that you Afro I'm tryna get to your centric
That's why I got a bottle of Champagne and then I sent it
Over where you sitting, noticed, pretend you didn't
Along with the bottle was a note attached
Here's some tickets to my show you should go to that
And it's a shame money's something that you barely need to knock her
I'm tryna treat her right 'cause she barely treated proper
But you showed up regardless of late choices it's clear
You really came to kick it it with Drake, Voyce and Amir like
I still remember where we were
Slow it down
First time we had the nerve
First time was not rehearsed
First time was almost perfect, still
There's no such thing as too far
No, no such thing as too far
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Too far gone
Still know that we can work
Slow it down
Still know what you deserve
Still mad 'bout who we are
But no different than we were
But still
There's no such thing as too far
No, no such thing as too far
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Too far gone
Should be here, but you ain't right now
Slow it down
Could be there, but I ain't right now
Both those things could be changed right now, and
I shouldn't be thinkin' about
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
What I would do if I was beside you
Slow it down
In a king-sized suite, layin' in those sheets
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
You know we work it out and I keep my eyes on you
Slow it down
You know I figured out the secrets to your body, baby
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Keep calm, keep calm
Slow it down
'Cause it's now or never
I want this forever
No one does it better, babe
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Keep calm, keep calm
Slow it down
Let's get it together
I want this forever
No one does it better, baby
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
I know you got your ways
Slow it down
I hope some change
I love the way you are
I'll take you either way
And if you don't come
Are you gon' stay?
And I don't wanna let you be the one that got away
Let's do anything but that
Slow it down
Oh no, oh no
I'm willing to do anything but that
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
And you know I should be there, but I can't right now
Slow it down
Could be here, but you ain't right now
Both those things could be changed right now, and
I shouldn't be thinkin' about
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
What I would do if I was beside you
Slow it down
In a king-sized suite, layin' in those sheets
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
You know we work it out and I keep my eyes on you
Slow it down
You know I figured out the secrets to your body, baby
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Keep calm, keep calm (oh yeah, yeah)
Slow it down
'Cause it's now or never
I want this forever
No one does it better, babe
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
And all I can say is
Keep calm
Slow it down
And all I can say is
Keep calm
Together
Let's get it together
I want this forever
No one does it better, baby
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Slow it down
Yeah, yeah
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Take time, take time
Takin' our time, and I get in and slide
Slow it down
Ooh, baby
And I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Slow it down
I've been watchin' you all night long, babe
Slow it down
You ask how many girls I been with in my life
I tell ya, "I stopped keeping count when I was 25"
I ask you the same thing, you tell me, "Seven guys"
But we both know that's a lie
'Cause if we countin' head and if we countin' drunken nights
Then that number that you gave just might be off by eight or nine
But it's still nowhere close to mine
Marcus prolly had to bring me straps like thirty times
He took over like four years ago when Courtne had resigned
I been talkin' sex with Courtne since like 2005
We been friends since junior high
Tough to enjoy the company and never cross the line
She's like, "Is it more than a hundred, with everyone combined?"
And I say, "Yeah, that's bein' kind"
At one point or another they all felt like they were mine
I had a lot of backs that I would never talk behind
I'm not really into threesomes, I like one thing at a time
I like when it's you and I
Plus I always feel like if somebody outperforms you
That could jeopardize your pride and I'm not into choosin' sides
Unless you 'bout to sleep and you askin' me what's my side
It's the right at home, but this a hotel so you can decide
Lessons that I learned before hittin' my prime
Confessions that I blame on the zodiac sign
Things you need to hear 'fore we say our goodbyes
Free myself of it all, watch a Scorpio rise
Yeah
Uh, more beautiful than the world
Word, matter of fact beautiful ain't the word
Unexplainable is the beauty of her
And I will be the race car hitting her curves
Errrrr
I drive her crazy, stupid retarded
Yeah and then I park it
She got a smile on her that put a smile on me
She cater to me she get all destiny child on me
She ride for me even though I got miles on me
She gon ride till the day they put flowers on me
Thats my darling
And I love it, yeh
Thats my, yeh
So sweet she bad for me
But she so good I'll take the cavity
Falling for her like how safe is gravity
I'll make your girl about face and marry me
Hahahaha, yeh
I do, do you
But ahhh, the things I'm willing to do to her
I wish I could have a threesome with two of her
I would sing a love song if I knew the words
But I'll be damned if another nigga do it first
Cos you the one, damn I think I see the sun
I guess that mean you gotta run
Well holla at me when you done
Can I dig it
When you baby
Woop woop woop
My darling baby
Uhh
She nothing like every other dime
I think about her and couple things come to mind
Thoughts like if she end up my baby mother fine
Cos we only use a rubber like every other time
Oooh, I bet she so embarrassed
I had to take her ass to Paris
Give her the moments that she cherish
You know
Yep
She got it coming to her like an heiress
And anything she want I Will like Farris
Oops I meant ferris and in the coupe I tint very light
So them hating bitches can see me and you at every light
Oooh, and I hope its one of them long lights
I mean I hope its one of them long nights
No wrong turns, ain't no such things as a wrong right
Uh yeah
You make me feel so good
And every time we cut I swear it heals so good
Its been over a year that shit is still so good
No adjusting for you, you know just what to do and all
Yea, oh and I love it
See I'm trying to make it public
I think the glass slipper does fit
And yesterday I told her she a muthafucker
And how her new haircut is so becoming of her
Oh thats your girl, well I'mma make a women of her
Never do to another what we do one another
Now thats a numbers for ya, and i'll give up my summers for ya
Yeah I'll spend my winters and my springs on it
And put a ring on it, eyy
Uhh, just say yes not no
The club is overrated baby lets not go
Lets stay home and burn a couple calories
Fuck the house up and make the maid earn a salary
Yeah I cook you dinner if you cook me breakfast
They say that nobodies perfect but you look perfected
I really love to be the one you took a step with
So trust me when I tell you it'd be worth the effort
Shes unbelievable like a purple leopard
Just give me the formula watch me work the method
Hehe, Weezy F, I prefer the best shit
And babe you the fucking best
You deserve a trophy
You could be my four leaf clover
Her clothes aren't tight nigga their cosy
And when she turn around they say Whoa like Joey
Thats my baby
And I love it
Yeah, Young Money
Yeahhh
Tay you know, you know I told you many times you my favorite rapper right?
I'mma start this off like you would do it
Uhh
Shout out to DJ Wristpect
October's Own!
Drizzy!
Hehe
Here I go!
Uhh
Look I stands out
So don't think this ain't some shit that I done planned out
And life is beautiful as ever when it pans out
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
But, ask Apple how I get it though
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never
I don't get bitter, I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled, "Hey bitches!"
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description
But that's just me though
But don't mind him girl, that's just Freako
Please don't cuss girl, that don't suit ya
His name 40 and his name Future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of O.V.O
I am not doing features now, no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I over-expressing the game
Should I hold back on addressing the lame
Because they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And ever since I've been messing with Wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
And Drake was at the club and he balled like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it
And all you talking ass niggas get over it
And all you people that be hating get over it
And all you women that I fucked get over it
And yea I'm turning 22 get over it
You know you got to hear my records get over it
My whole team getting rich get over it
I got the city on my back get over it
Get over it, get over it
DJ Wrispect
Little Brother
Pooh, 'Te
Big doe I see you homie
Yeah
I'm serious man, please, just get over it
Just for y'all I'mma keep it humble as a mumble in the jungle
Y'know what I'm talkin' bout
It's Drizzy
Thank Me Later coming soon
Just lemme live man
It's all I ask
Here I go
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall
I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If I’m with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades in a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I live at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?
Cause I don’t waste time, can’t you see a nigga lazy
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy’s fucking crazy
Can I, can I save you from you
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you been sipping
Not suppose to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do (yeah)
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I found one
Making a mistake I never learned from
I swear I always fall for your type (yeah)
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type (yeah oh uh oh)
For your type
I just can't explain this shit at all (*4X*)
I believe in people like you
Cause who am I to judge you on the past girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before
Uh look, dress hanging off your shoulder barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and startin over
Girl quit playing you just drunk you just sayin' shit
And you dance, dance all high, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait, no I get it
Girl I’m wit' it
I’ve been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn
I wonder why I never learn my lesson
It's feeling like a second chance and it’s the first impression
And I heard there’s nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man it’s been a while and I swear that this one's different
That’s why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again
About how reckless I have been
And I’m slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I’m just trying to correct it, and I fall
Sentimental and your body is righteous
Tight as I want it
Tight as my lips when I lock them in silence
And your cellphone is ringin' and you're worried 'bout somethin'
And you're walkin' outside on me now
Which side are you on again?
What room does he have you in?
What time do you leave again?
How long do we just stay friends?
What role do I play again?
I can't even make new friends
I'm here with no move again
I need to know how this ends
Yeah
9th Wonder
Don't judge me, man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El 'bout to prove 'em wrong, though
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
They don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
Or that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart, girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart, girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'ma take this hat off, and I'ma hit it till I'm back soft
And then I backs off
'Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
Uhh, me and Wayne was gettin' high on 'em
He leaned over and told me, "Just don't retire on 'em
And when they give ya they shoulders, never cry on 'em
And when they love you to death, just never die on 'em"
And the question still remains
Have I counted all the money that I've managed to obtain?
Niggas dedicatin' overtime to damagin' my name
And somehow I'm still the hottest motherfucker in the game
Uh, tryin' not to over think
Only 'cause I drove and I've done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon' do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure
Who's that peekin in my window?
Uh, you should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
Wii can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt + Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late, and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie?
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try?
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now
Mad 'cause she ain't like me
Oh you're mad 'cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're tryna find somebody
To replace what I gave to ya
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Don't need ya, could care less
I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the best, yeah I said
Boy, I'm the best, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you got your hair cut
Did you forget that's me?
The voice in your speaker right now
That's me, that's me
And that voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see, that I made it, yeah I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded
Take a shot for me, oh, oh, woah
Take a shot for me, oh, oh, woah
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me
Okay look, I'm honest, boy I can't lie I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated for the record back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me, boy I don't get you
He says I know you changed, I never see you
'Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish he had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
I can tell that you've been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
'Cause baby I'm the best
I'm the, I'm the best
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Take a shot for me, oh, oh, woah
Take a shot for me, oh, oh, woah
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Alright I got this, you can never get this
I built it up from nothin', you would think I'm playin' Tetris
Thousand-dollar sweater on but I don’t never sweat shit
Swear the beats they give me got a motherfuckin’ death wish
Yeah, tell me who controls kings
I don't follow rules, stupid old things
I'm flyin' through the city in a coupe with those wings
And my team deserves some motherfuckin' Super Bowl rings
Young Money
Uh, yeah, alright
Uh, well alright
Yeah, well alright
Uh huh, yeah
Feel good
It's a celebration, clap-clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscato
For the girl who's a student and her friend who's a model
Finished the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where ya tats is
Show me where ya hands at, maybe I can grasp it
They say if ya get her you can understand her better
And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her
Yeah, and I got it together
So when they talk they try deter me it's like whatever
Tell em' I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself
This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage ya
Especially when you think noone is understanding ya
These girl groups with they overprotective managers
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate
Goodness gracious on top is such a hard place
Yea... but if you never even been there
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures in ya swimwear
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air
I know that shit is exhausting girl
And your mistakes are costing girl
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself
Hey yo Aristo, I'm lost, can you tell me whats goin' on in the streets?
How it feel to count dough while you palmin' the heat?
And yes I asked for a 16, you did your 16
I heard that weak shit and only wanted the beat (it's true)
But fuck the money and the cars that I drive to set
And fuck the women that's lying to all the guys they met
And fuck the features on my songs and the deals on the table
Or basically it's fuck everything that you strive to get
And it's the room of resolution, I'm finishing it in here
If I copy Budden's flow, you mimickin' his career
And the same money we hearin' you giving to charity
You need to be giving to Littles to give him some clarity (what up Littles)
'Cause that's your homeboy I think he's owed that much
Tell him pressing 25 don't mean you sold that much
And Breana, I don't mean to alarm ya
But you need to get outside the car to shoot this video in Parma (Tony!)
You act like you hood and hood niggas'll harm ya
And this is not hatin' my nigga we call it karma
But yo Thug Life, show me where the hammer be
Yes I took an L on my own and they didn't damage me
You try to cover up your lies like a canopy
And tryna pull 17 year olds down in Bramalea (I know about it)
And we don't got it out for you
We just saying that don't nobody vouch for you
Nope, nobody thorough is willing to give a cosign (nobody)
And you don't even sell blow, you just blow time
You can't even get a factor grant
So stop rapping, go fix parts at a tractor plant (damn)
And listen here, Tetley Tea
You one of the seven dwarfs standing next to me
You probably snitchin' in court, then accept the plea
And I hear you paying these women and I sex for free (what up sweetheart)
But dog, how did this start, how we get to this part?
We all got niggas doing bids "Mr. Wishheart" (what up Cam)
It's not cool to use another nigga's as a threat tho'
I said you a bitch, I heard a seven man echo
You saying I hustle, my source for currency coke
They saying you never moving it and currently broke
And you risk doing crack time and hang around black crime
Just so you can have something to say in you rap lines
They say Drake killed it like young girls at a private school (I did)
Dog if I were you, I tell you what I would do
I would cut ties with the cops and just make them fire you
Lose the body pack and the velcro you feed the wire through
Tell them not to call and that's even if they require you
'Cause they the only people recording that wanna hire you (it's true)
With what I spend in a weekend I could acquire you
Some of them believe you got money you little liar you
But, I don't admire you, short niggas tell tall tales
Good riddance Aristo I just retired you!
Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Everybody said that you let me down
Hesitation bring the "you" around
Makes no difference what you used to do
I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I could never
Maybe you were reckless yesterday
I'm convinced you know a better way, I know it
Some would judge based on what you've been through but
I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I, I could never (yeah, yeah)
You've told me things
Harsh truth to my face
I've been told to walk away (just know)
I could never
Things that I would choose to do with you if I had time though
Thousand times I fucked you in my mind, trust me I know
It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
Since we getting Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards, I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rolling with some jokers
And me, I'm rolling with some brokers
Like, damn, could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock rooms
Ugh, and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers are cliché
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be all in your face, like, "No speak-a la ingles"
Soon as you hear it, you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me, I'm aware, and my car's right there
Is this interior enough for y'all ulterior motives?
'Cause if you like it, y'all should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
A lot of ice, a lot of cream like Dickie Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Michie Mee
But I'ma try and have you on the trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex-man is a hater, officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point, I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays, rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself is who I am feeling, probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here, baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they paid me
Mr. Bet You That's Expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
Spitting a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it, girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that 'Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well, I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga, keep your two cents, I ain't tryna leave you broke
Life of a don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
And something crazy on my arm, uh-ahem
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
Nah
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars, I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would've cared more
That's my only feeling inside whenever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know
'Cause that's basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a missus
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
I can't stop, missing you
I can't stop, missing you
(I don't wanna stop) I can't stop missing you
(Baby) I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop, missin' you
Young Money till the young boy dyin' out

Slow the F down 'fore yo ass is on Pluto
Tell me what it do
I belong to the youngest Grammy nominated crew
My city love me, but I got Toronto haters too
That sit around and talk about
What they’d have done if they was you
But know I ball without a sphere in sight
Club owners give me reasons to appear at night
And just know thatIbe in the mirror like
Are you listenin’? I hope you hearin' right
I’m in the Aston doin' doughnuts
I will kill the game and never send it my condolence
Taught to never love a chick and only love the moments
New York City, I can tell the people want it
Uhh, what you got for me flex, uh
Vacuum interiors and shined wheels
What's ya life like? This how mine feels
I like my seat back, I like my wine chill
I look good, smell better, and I rhyme ill
I say I’m at these girls neck and head
You and your girl sleep in separate beds
I killed this, tell Flex it's dead
You got birthday cake, mines weddin' tall
Y'all lemon small, y'all never ball
I get the girl of your dreams and I never call
NY, I got it, I'm bout whatever y'all
Yeah, 40 hears my interviews, tone it down
I’m at your girls condo gettin' shown around
Yeah, why you takin' everything personal?
This that in-ya-face, all-offensive-on-purpose flow
My city, never F’n need me
Yeah, oh wait no they really need me
Oh wait, hold up, Young F’n Weezy
Holla at me when you done F’n Weezy
Hands are tied
Someone's in my ear from the other side
Tellin' me that I should pay you no mind
Wanted you to not be with me all night
Wanted you to not stay with me all night
I know, you know, who that person is to me
Doesn't really change things

You know how I get down
But look I'm just gon keep it real
I'd like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup
Yeah
(Gotta be something wrong with you baby)
Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up
(Ohh Yeah)
Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama (Damn)
You're the only one
That's causin me this drama
And then expect favors (Yea)
When you come in town
And I know if I see you guaranteed it's goin down
Cause
Too stay with this girl (Ho!)
You couldn't pay me!
I respect a woman
But this bitch is crazy (Hahaha)
This bitch is crazy (Yea)
This bitch is crazy

But this bitch is crazy
She don't even know

She just oblivious to the whole shit like
And you know like I was sayin sometimes

Goddamn
I said it without sayin' it man
Uh yeah man, VO
Back again like we never left huh
I'm sending this out to any of my girls thats different man
Anybody thats special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so I'mma start off like this
Uh look, I'm bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
I'll go around the world and back
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh
(Yeah man; yeah)
You can't just love me like they do
(Talk to 'em V; I need somebody special in you girl)
I need someone special in you
(I know they out there somewhere dude; Ho!)
I know that out there theres a few
(Put ya hands up ladies; Yeah man)
See I've been searching I don't what to do
Can you help me?
(Uh)
She gotta be special
(Yea; You gotta hold me down baby)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)
You gotta be special
(Yeah; You never know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
(Uh)
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be
Since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
Ever since the demo dog
And groupies are gettin' brave
Now they ask me for
Rappers, I write 'em a verse
And ask me to spit it
But I pay no mind though
Cause they know I know
Hard as these niggas working man
They won't sign so
Drake and VO back
I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh
(Yea; uh)
You can just love me like they do

A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be
Look theres requirements to be an admirer
Still the new version of fresh needa a Nia or Tyra
So we can be Jenny and Swayze
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe it's karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a knight so I stay in a armor
I'm fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve
I'm special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when adding basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double O, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple
All you have to do
Is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh

You can't just love me like they do
(Yea; And you a legend for real, ima give you that man)

Vo, D-R-A-K-E
We them boys came to see (get busy ya'll)
Yeah we take it to the same degree
So let loose cause you came (get busy ya'll)
Boi-1da... Drizzy
Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket on my pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records, are you saying ghost?
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm getting rich, uhh, you staying broke
Chillin' even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch if you throw me high-fives
They try to measure up, but there is no one my size
Whatever 40's smokin' 'bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement, I'm taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cause it's about to go
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't pickin' up or entertainin' them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin' on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang in Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I cannot relate
Ridin' with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin' with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest, I'mma knock him out his place
Call me homicide Drizzy, I'm 'bout to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goody like I'm Cee-lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-pass is as valid as can be
I'm so fresh, a stylist would agree
Waving at your girl while she's smiling back at me like
Look, kill the game, no one recovers the murder weapon
Young Angel, if you hate me tell me burn in heaven (Brrrrat!)
How'd ya sleep on me? The highest earnin freshmen
Like your third infection, I hope you learned your lesson (Yeah)
Yeah, I spit raw but I prefer protection
I own a heart and a mind and a shirt she slept in
Bitch, I got the answer, and still ain't heard the question
I shut your club down, please reserve my section
Fuck a confrontation, there ain't no cake in it
And I'm caking, bitch, so tell me why I'd take a break from it
The mother of your child always tell you I'm her favorite
She call me her baby—not the one she was in labor with
She say, "Ooh, you taste good," I say, "Ooh, just savor it"
She know that she love a nigga, I be on that major shit
'Cause I get paid to stand, and I get paid to sit
So I don't walk around with money, baby girl—I'm made of it
Why you over there looking at me
While your man standing right beside you?
The temporary happiness he might provide you
But you know and I know that nobody gon' do you like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line-of-sight
I know that I feel her, but slowly, I'm kinda like
I don't really wanna hit this girl
And still, she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'ma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under your ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playing around
It gets deeper and colder, the funny thing is
I'm writing this in my head as she asleep on my shoulder, like...
I'm about whatever, man, fuck what they talking about
Their opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Awww, and we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night (All night!) whole crew in here
'Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Awww, man, I love my team, man, I love my team (Yeah)
I'll die for them niggas, awww (Yeah)
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talking 'bout
Their opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Awww, and we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
'Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Man, I love my team, man, I love my team
I'll die for them niggas, awww
Yes
I'm on that old, switch lanes shit, Jay, Big, Dame's shit
Talking 'bout them niggas that my daddy pitch cane wit
Because I never learned the biz, I learned the language
Well-spoken, man I should've went to Cambridge
And mama would always claim this
I never expected the outcome, but one day I became this
Famous, no longer nameless
More game, but I'm the same, I will remain this
I'm still focused, I stay grounded
You see I ran with a style when they clowned it
So read 48 Laws if you never read it
Because that is one of the main reasons I'm level-headed
Despite the accumulated success
If my attitude ever strayed, I made it regress
I never wanted to win the lottery only because my uncle
Told me "He who made it by struggling made it the best"
So with that on my chest, I'm down on my last 12 gs
Going through the closet thinking I should prolly sell these
Chanel Cs, and LVs, somebody stop before I really start to rebel please
I spend it all, who needs anymore?
Whose satisfied doin' good deeds anymore?
Who grieves anymore, who believes anymore?
Who graduated school and still reads anymore?
Not me, that should have my whole race shook
Because we don't read novels but we do FaceBook
The new craze is havin' that new age look
If I said I liked it, I'd feel like a two-faced crook
Nah, I tell retro kids tie that bandana just a little bit tighter
'Til it suffocates you, biter
Cause I don't wear no bright colors or rope chains
I'm a G, my daddy was in the dope game
Murda on the beat
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Look, turned this to an organization
Used to have bashments down in the basement
Look in the ceiling, pink foam insulation
Now we just link up for corporate occasions
Say she been fuckin' with me since the Hazelton
If I don't like how he's movin', I'm pagin' him
Hear that they dissin', back then, I was raisin' 'em
Niggas is in for the rudest awakenin'
Walls are so tall I don’t know who my neighbor is
Baka, my crodie, his songs are amazing
But I knew that nigga when he wasn't makin' 'em
Yeah, turned this to a organization
Rap-A-Lot Mob, we tied up like laces
Bank in Bahamas, you know I'm evasive
I got my money in ten different places
GME, B.O.B., joint operations
If it's a problem, I'm droppin' location
Or I send Kayla, she's very persuasive
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country y'all
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!
Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best, decisions you've made
I'm sonnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me, Trey's girl? Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
But you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best
And I know that you been working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
Your body drive mi crazy-y-y
Your body need a license f'it
Your body ah too tight and neat
Anybody who got eyes can see
She just wanna dance and tease
She just wanna dance and tease me
She just wanna dance and tease me
She just wanna dance and tease me
She just wanna dance and tease me
Listen, you've been missing since 2016
Squid tell me you wan fix tings
You know that's my sis and
When she speak, I listen
She swears you're my missus
I say we think different
I, I, I, I see
Why your heart's icy
Come baby, come, come try me
Who you gonna love if you run by me, yeah (Ready?)
Too many twist and turns
Twist and turns, yeah
Love the way you twist and turn
Twist and turn, yeah
Baby, 'cause mi eye too fry, I get burned, yeah
Love the way you twist and turn
Twist and turn, yeah
(She just wanna dance and tease)

(She just wanna dance and tease me)
(She just wanna dance and tease) Yeah, she better stop dat
(She just wanna dance and tease me)
(She just wanna dance and tease)
(She just wanna dance and tease me)
Man, you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
And love, I don't mind feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm in the fresh and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
Cause mine is Polo, and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
You can call me professor
But baby you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
So you can work it off
Baby I can give you extra credit
But there's something else
Girl can I frisk you?
Search you body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
Its cause your hiding ?
And I'm going to sentence you
Baby you can do your time on me
I can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it us?
Can I love you all of my life?
Ugh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about are talkin' blunt and stayin' blunted
Pretty women are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all just disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You seem to flee to all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rolling and their mood change
Like a muthafucka
New flow, I got a dozen of em
I don't trust you, you're an undercover
I could probably make some stepsisters fuck each other, whew
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What? Tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it
Please
D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume
Something spinnin' fast either me or it's the room
I bet you it's the room, cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if your ears a virgin I'd advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't Christian
It's that motherfuckin' heat you can find up in the kitchen
Baby holla at your nigga, I got that shit for low
Okay maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down (down) I'm gettin' ahead (head)
Plus it's gettin' hot so I'm a take a seat instead (stead)
I'm lucky I ain't dead (dead) I'm on a rollercoaster ride y'all
We all of age and I ain't got nothin' to hide y'all
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin' me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created

I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin' like I'm-
Girl, I hate the fast talking, fast walking, fast fucking, fast loving oh
Wanna move slow
Got a little liquor in my system, always been friends underestimating how far that that shit go
Leave a little room for me
Leave a little room for your imagination
You should just take time with me
Nowadays there's time but not anticipation
Oh oh oh
What is?
What is? What is? What is different about me? Oh
Tell me. What is? What is?
Can't keep you off of me
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will

Ringing like a telethon

First single got me banned from America

Man, fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Uh, uh, fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it’s six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout to all my Asian girls, Dim Sum
Shots came I don’t know where they descend from
Probably some bad hoes, I’m 'bout to take your hemp from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only the real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I’m just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Don’t I got that shit the world, wanna hear again?
Don’t Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows just bore me, paint drying
I’m never tripping over anything that ain't mine
I’m hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It’s been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I didn't notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
And the kids wearing crowns over here and everything is alright
Do I love these hoes? Mmm, kinda-sorta
I got 'em drinking Sangria like it's fucking water
Some Miami women, tanlines showing
And they really 'bout whatever, shit is mind-blowing
Fuck what they talk, do what I say
Bust it open, girl, and send it my way
You say you like it like that, I think I like it, too
Half a million in a week, it's only right I do
All-seeing eye—my, I seen it all
I talk a lot of shit, I swear I mean it all, yeah
One-oh-three
And both fingers to the haters tryna front on me, ahh!
I used to cut the porch lights on
And now I cut the Porsche lights on
Just to let em know their foresight's wrong
Where this nigga going with that obscure ice on
He a lame, I'm tryna get my mature life on
I asked what happen, or whats hattenin', hattenin'
Hop up out the passenger and help me back the phantom in
Damn, I never got to use that in a convo
Never got the chance to put you back in a condo
And, and, it couldn't be more true
I always meant to get you that villa in Corfu
Women I pass off, and money I tore through
Now all I really need is the number before 2
Is it over, tell me it isn't over
They told me it was easy as I get a little older, yeah right
And this is what my life outro sound like
Even though Dre did it this shit don't sound right
I was, born to do it, born to make bomb music
I flow tight like I was born Jewish
Well, actually I was born Jewish
I guess at this point you could say I was born foolish (ha)
Yea, what about the grammy's and the bubbly
What about all my fans that be loving me, I
Used to chill in them spots where the trouble be
But never ended up in that menage at the Double Tree
What about that girl Rita down in Basque
In L.A Swear I would of never cheated on your ass
But you ain't give me yo number cause them niggas got to fighting
Situation got me thinking and that's when I got to writing, hmm...
Change these hundreds for me cashier
Cause I ain't made it but I'm better off than last year, yeah
And what it look like hun'
I never got to make it rain but it look like fun
And, uh, a king is what I'm fit to be
I don't get these niggas, they a mystery
I mean they talk so quiet as if it its private
And they don't ever bring that shit to me, but
Man I ain't live life so wrong
I said fuck a couple dudes, cause I ain't like yo song
Least let me tell you why I'm this way
Hold on...
You gettin' ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spendin' hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you’re the fuckin' coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my LA girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my TO girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, nails done hair done
Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together
I’m down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it
And I can tell you, she wants me
She wants me, she wants me, she wants me
And yes I want her too
I'ma take your girl
I swear to you every time I sees her, I seizure
Keep running through my mind, jog my memories; amnesia
Touch ya, tease ya, nervous? don't freeze up
She let me take control, I run a woman like a Visa
She always run back to me saying he's a
Dog off the leash, he got this other girl Alicia
She tell me she's in hell, I tell her take a breather
I'm nothing like your man, but I can't love you neither
It's wifey over bitches, but money's over her
Cause money's under nothing, my life is such a blur
It's not the way it has to go, it' just what I prefer
And any Young Money nigga I know would concur
Weezy talk to 'em!
Shawty got a man, but I got a plan
Listen, homie, I ain't trying to force your hand
But I'ma take your girl
I'ma take your girl
And her girls and they girls
Comin' with me yeah, talkin' one on three yeah
They ain't playin no D yeah
Thats cause they playin for me yeah
Shawty got a man, but I got a plan
Look, homie, I ain't trying to force your hand
But I'ma take your girl
I'ma take your girl
This that other shit, you know you ask for it
I might just send you some money to getcha passport
So you can come to me city, I’ll take you all over
And hit you on the balcony, just don’t fall over
Send me a picture baby, you know I’d never leak it
I know you got somethin' recent, for someone decent
Why you laughing out loud? I’m serious
Bring your girl if you a little bi-curious
Please, please no storytellin' to others
I promise you gon' love it, I would never let you down
Feel like I might of perfected, all the things that you’ve expected
And you gon' know it when you bring your ass around
Motherfucker, oh
They say he wanted the bounce back
I can easily make them admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game. Ahh
Who else really trying to mess with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G though
Treating Birmingham just like my Hollywood shows
I'm trying to tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
I live fast die young, never take it slow
Tell your girl to tell a friend that it's time to go
And tell me today's weather
I know they say they good, but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really it's whatever
I am murdering and this is so amusing
If they're a sight to see then I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then
And keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking
These London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he a hater, baby, he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lying to the kids like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to Saint Vincent, Saint Marry
But I ain't playing high school games
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane
I'm to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra
Baby girl on that Mclaren
You gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
I do it better than the best could
You know what it is, Drake and Tim Westwood
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing to
That's the wrong thing to do
Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
I play it down
That's the wrong thing
That's the wrong thing
Finally back in Toronto, it's better here
I just wanna be anywhere but everywhere
I'm being lazy at the crib kushin' it up
I get enough exercise just pushing my luck
Sitting back thinking damn where did they go
They used to be the ones to watch Ricki Lake show
And now I see em picking up the pieces
One too many starting over speeches
I guess it’s back to me like it always was
Me and the OVO set like it always was
A little money on the counter I left for my girl
With a note I’m trying to see the rest of the world
It all looked so amazing when we were growing up
Used to sit back and say I know I’ll get a model one day
But all the money and the rap game slow as fuck
And all the models from the hood, Project Runway
Yeah, it’s whatever
You know
Feeling good
Living better
But it’s evident that nothing can prepare us for certain moments that you just gotta cherish
Like this young girl had my lyrics tatted on her arm last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I been here before, huh?
Yeah, I still got ten years to go, huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
And dub me, you never love me
Any confidence I came with, you take it from me
I just wanna get beside you and make you love me
I just can not take the silence, you keep ignorin' me
See you makin' all this time for more important things
We was s'posed to catch a vibe the other night
Busy now, but you was down that other time
Why you always lead me on and give me signs?
I just wanna get beside and make you mine
I just wanna come inside and reunite
Got me waitin' outside
Love me, save me, tell me, try me
All you do is lie to me
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
All you do is lie to me
Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely
Need more than a homie
Takin' me for granted, I could tell
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope
Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope
Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (yeah)
If I ever disappear (look), best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again (yeah)
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard
I tell her, I'm getting motherfuckin' busy
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, "Who is he?"
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy
And I'm focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when you're better than your idol?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
I'm everything you just haven't become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done
Now hopefully live to see what they say that I'm gon' be
And if not then I hope future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet than to be
On the stand jeopardizing an inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane, pick a lane, that's all I ever heard
But I'm just trying to swerve, without hitting the curb
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos with hater niggas and crop them
I am not them, I photoshop them out
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about
Yeah, the Chris Paul of this fall
Sittin' this tall, I float high, goodbye, I will miss y'all
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear (yeah), best believe I'm comin' back
Stunt hard (I'm leanin')
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (haan)
If I ever disappear ('bout time)
Best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard (they'll know)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again (yeah, okay)
All I ever do is stunt hard
I did it all on my own, turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world, stunt hard
I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere
If I ever disappear, best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again, all I ever do is stunt hard
My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from the back
You can die where you from, or die where you at
Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
'specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is
Thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
She be jumping up and down
Trynna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour
Just to get that belt to fasten
All she wanna talk about is partying and fashion
Don't know where she going
But I do not plan on asking at all
Cause her spirit is free
And she, lets nobody else in except for me
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree
I’m the only one she loves
There’s no copies of the key
Homie, that’s a guarantee
Don’t forget that Fendi purse that you put all your cash in
Kinda hard to concentrate when cameras are flashin’
Other dudes would suffocate her, I don’t want her gaspin’
Don’t know where she’s going
And I do not plan on asking at all
I’ve never been the type, felt alike
My connection with niggas that wanna fight
Over women, that's not right
There's too many in the world
Homie, you can have your pick
But I swear that ones my girl
I swear that one’s my girl!
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to, yeah (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
Yeah, they don't love you like they used to (What you say?)
In the city with the- windows down
Like I used to, yeah (What you say?)
Like I
Take some to getting used to (What you say?)
Man, they don't love you like they used to, man
And I'm so sorry
Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together—motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this? How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions? We ain't doing no interview!
I'm black and Jewish
Don't be so foolish
I'm black and Jewish
It's a Mitzvah
Please don't forget I'm black, please don't forget I'm Jewish
I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W-2 is
Chilling in Boca Raton with my mensch, Lenny Kravitz
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz
At my show, you won't simply put your hands in the air
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer
Like Baruch Yitadel Yisrael
Ve'et ha Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen
I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy
Do not go to Feingold's, though
The pickles are rubber
And I will not be harming ya
I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it
I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah
Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada
Daddy from Africa
Best of worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya
Challah!
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm so unsigned, it would blow ones mind
Cause to every single record, I am so unkind
There are no holds barred, there is no love lost
Nigga, this that crack and you know drugs cost
So P-A-Y-U-P
I don't think you'll ever find another nigga like me
Never L-I-E, I got everything I tell 'em I got
This young nigga showboat like I'm sellin' a yacht
Ya heard me?
Who else tryna smoke? Yeah, nigga, me too
Cause take my mind off the preasure is what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a ski-doo
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down ho, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm goin' in like a life sentence
And understand I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that: 10-4
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne
Look, here we go
The first time around
I left the cars at the house and I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go its about the rhyming now
Im seeing it clearer the season is nearer
And still I must change
Im like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm outspoken still
They not sure of the work but they all hoping he'll
Emerge to victor my words are pictures
And guess the colours so loud that you heard my scripture
With 4 walls give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I've been thinking before y'all
I barely get tired I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week what I'm daily required
I meet quotas while you rappers having sleep-overs
Spending nights in the studio trying to beat Hova
Be in the throne instead of being your own
But Look
I'm making moves in my city so
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls is steady tryin to get with me though
Important and vital I'm caught in a cycle
This is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain it, my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king nigga its the same thing
All day long
But thats a screw face
Rappers befriend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping they slip and trip over your own shoelace
Thats why I tuck em in not giving a fuck again
D.R.A. you add a K.E
A couple mill and you labels cannot play me
I never go broke I'm far from a flash in the pan
I am a passionate man, plan it with cash in my hand
Uh
I got few days left
But I'mma make use of every single one until every singles done
Until every record is sold, and every string is strung
Tell me take a breather Drake and everything will come
Dog its always been the same
Its all love like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in the driveway
I roll down strips and hose down whips
That when turtle wax up they would close down Richmond
With no down shifting
Haters would say I'm adequate
Think I got the type of flow that would make an addict quit
21 years I've been pimping since being
Repurchased trap music 4 times since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince
Getting pennies for my thoughts
So I put my two cents in
Top of the morning I am dropping the coin in
Plus I'm changing the game
You hear me swapping the joint in
They put the fires out and bring the buyers out
And try and box us all together before they buy us out
If they profit from the events we handing flyers out
Then we profit from the attempts to hand desires out
But rich is how we all ending up
I'm at the label in the elevator send them up
I can buy it all out
But this the only shit that I sip though
So tell 'em bring the waitress
And I won't even ask what it hit fo'
Just send her to the bar like (like)
Send her to the bar like (like)
Send her to the bar like (like)
Like them niggas over there wanna..
Pop Rosé (Hey... ay ay)
Pop Rosé (Hey... ay ay)
Pop Rosé (Hey... ay ay)
Pop Rosé
Uh
They say you get paid when you think ahead
Valentines day girl, all you see is pink and red (yup)
And everything is on me
Rosé Spade to the '96 Don P
Hang around us, and I bet you
We'll get to stunt on whoever ya sittin' next to
You put 'em all on, and watch 'em run wit' it
And then wait for whatever's next when I'm done with it
And niggas show hate, period
It's like they all pregnant, they late, period
Yeah and shit's all good
The deal got signed and my split's all good
And some people pretendin' that it's all good
Say that shit in person man I wish y'all would
Yeah I told you I partied with Azuka
I'll let them other niggas Grey Goose ya
And we about to (yup)
Are you drunk? I'm faded too
When you get money they just hate on you
But, fuck them, there's all these ladies in my view
So I ball baby (Yup)
Ball baby
Ball baby
Ball baby
Alright my patience runnin' thin
Olympic pools of money, I'm just glad I learned to swim
Cannonball, bitch, I hope your diving board's sturdy
And I hope when dinner's cold, my niggas do not desert me
Nah, but shit's all good
The deal got signed and my split's all good
And these haters pretendin' that it's all good
Say that shit in person, man I wish y'all would
I say you lucky if your father was a figure
Cause my uncle was my father and my father was my nigga
And my mother so proud cause his son is gettin' bigger
I took time to load the bullets, now I'm 'bout to pull the trigger
Like boom, boom, boom, I'm a genius, god dammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Skinny told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me
Yeah, nd to my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname Starter-Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other lames is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like
Time after time after time (Ayy)
Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind
And they ain't never satisfied (Yeah)
And we ain't ever satisfied (Ayy, they ain't ever satisfied)
And you can make it rain until your arms tired (Yeah)
As soon as it all stop them bitches just wonder why (Yeah)
They ain't never satisfied
They ain't never satisfied (Oh no, oh no)
And they ain't ever
Ain't no pressure on the money, Lord knows
But we still be on the road like we scared of going broke
We ain't never satisfied (No, no, never)
We ain't never (Never), we ain't never (No, no, never)
Time after time after time (Ayy)
Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind
And they ain't never satisfied (Yeah)
And we ain't ever satisfied (Ayy, they ain't ever satisfied)
And you can make it rain until your arms tired (Yeah)
As soon as it all stop them bitches just wonder why (Yeah)
They ain't never satisfied
They ain't never satisfied (Oh no, oh no)
And they ain't ever
Ain't no pressure on the money, Lord knows
But we still be on the road like we scared of going broke
We ain't never satisfied (No, no, never)
We ain't never (Never), we ain't never (No, no, never)
Yeah, yeah
There's a lot of money in the room
She said she wanna ball, wanna shoot some hoop
I put up big numbers for a new recruit
We just out here doing what young niggas do
Me and that boy Future could probably start a group
On some K-Ci and JoJo shit, have these bitches loose
Man, they know what it do
We got these niggas in the game stuck and they shouldn't move
I don't like sudden moves
Tell me, how is it that every fuckin' verse get the rewind?
And the watch cost too much for free time
And I hit the strip club, that's my me time
See I can't get much bigger, I'm that nigga
But they ain't never satisfied
Time after time after time (Ayy)
Money's all I get and there's still money on my mind
And they ain't never satisfied (Yeah)
And we ain't ever satisfied (Ayy, they ain't ever satisfied)
And you can make it rain until your arms tired (Yeah)
As soon as it all stop them bitches just wonder why (Yeah)
They ain't never satisfied
They ain't never satisfied (Oh no, oh no)
And they ain't ever
Ain't no pressure on the money, Lord knows
But we still be on the road like we scared of going broke
We ain't never satisfied (No, no, never)
We ain't never (Never), we ain't never (No, no, never)
Yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Yeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
It's Drake man, it's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO! Southern Smoke!!!
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But
This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a "nigga"
I'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist
Am I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
Like girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably could've been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
Daughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
And I don't wanna question half the places Nick been
UH-OHHHHHH
Okay, I got these girls quite hype
Only thing on right now like a nightlight
While my brother Wayne rockin' out like a White Stripe
I'mma kill the game, I'm the Young Money white knight
Yeah, plus I'm lookin for the right type
Cautious of a flood so I always lay the right pipe
Wes put me on the marquee flight life
Plus I go hard for the woman that I might wife
I put the ring on her index finger
So if you wanna keep ya girl please don't bring her
I bet I'm the type of guy that she got a thing for
And you would block me, but this ain't Jenga
Yeah, and she's someone I would work with
That's what I can tell from what she's showin' on the surface
I ain't sayin I'm requestin' anyone that's perfect
But I just need a woman that'll make it all worth it
I've got it made thats what I'm talking about
Going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride
Check, I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh J's, new pants
Back when "fuck bitches, get money" was the new chant
It started out about a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single
If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and I'm whats wrong with the game, but I'm feelin' like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know
Stacks on deck, lac's mounted on D's
I dont trust you so make sure you count it all please
And once its all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad cause they account is on freeze
Baby pay attention please, I'm more coordinated then a dance team
Its my turn, my turn like advance green
My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to rome and I just wanna take her
Im tryin to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in jamaica
I say 'baby get low', You just getting by
They hating cause my swagger at a all time high
Shit its a damn shame homie I dont even try
Get money mofo is all you hear me reply
Damn, I thought I had it all figured it out
Especially when it came to relationships and girls
But just when I least expected it
Love, rearranged my whole world
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion
Endlessly
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion
'Cause you're good girl and you know it
Good girl and you know it
You act so different around me, so different around me
'Cause you're good girl and you know it
Good girl and you know it
You act so different around me, so different
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion
'Cause you're good girl and you know it
Good girl and you know it
You act so different around me, so different around me
'Cause you're good girl and you know it
Good girl and you know it
You act so different around me, so different
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
Just hold on we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (I know, it gets so hard)
Just hold on we're going home (we're going home)
Ooh, I guess that's just the motion
Ooh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
Alright so
I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ice so
What is about to unfold
No tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though
I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw
That is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world
Got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like �I ain't getting service in your area�
You be like �Nigga get your bars up�
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong
I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby! (look)
Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
And I'ma leave on one more note
One more motherfuckin' note
It's like this, look at him
I ain't been here in a minute
Cut the lights off
I feel fantastic right now, baby
I said I used to keep the porch lights on
And now I keep the Porsche's lights on
Just to let them know their foresight's wrong
Where this rapper goin' with that obscure ice on?
He a lame, I'm just tryna get my mature life on
OD, OD, everybody know me
Even fans that resemble them kids in the O.C.
Oh me, oh my, them girls love me like Seth Cohen
So get a grip, get a glass, pour the X.O. in
I dare one of these niggas to say I'm not insane
Pick a road 'cause where you drivin' is not a lane
And rest in peace to Pimp C, life is not a game
Takin' over the world, no Pinky, just a lotta brain
He 'bout to send them the shit that I'm on
You prob'ly could have predicted I'm on
My sense of judgment's officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the Swisher is blown
I'm grown, I'm grown
I'm livin' in this elevator zone alone
I'm up so high I'm never comin' down
And you say you got them hoes, but they never comin' round
I got Penthouse walls, I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all, my balcony is glass
And wifey's over (bitches), but money's over (her)
'Cause money's under (nothin'), my life is such a (blur)
That's not the way it has to go, that's just what I prefer
And do not disagree with me, it's best you just concur
I'm a legend with a legacy that can't help but survive
Even when I fuckin' die they gonna bury me alive
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm livin' good, grippin' wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good (OD, OD)
Bitches over there, we good (OD, OD)
Money on the floor, we good
OD, OD, everybody know me
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm livin' good, grippin' wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good (OD, OD)
Bitches over there, we good (OD, OD)
Money on the floor, we good
OD, OD, everybody know me
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm livin' good, grippin' wood with all the features
Jesus, my money straight, no creases, p-p-peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air, we good (OD, OD)
Bitches over there, we good (OD, OD)
Money on the floor, we good
OD, OD, everybody know me
Boy Wonder
(C.O.S.S.O.M)
Drizzy
Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket of my pants
I still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records all you sing ghost
20 thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm getting rich while you stayin' broke
Chillin even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through a Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch when you throw me high fives
They try to measure up but there is no one my size
Whatever 40 smoking about to lower my eyes
Beast mode on em, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement I take the flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't picking up an' entertaining them at all
Got your girl face down banging on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Hmm, hmm, hmmm
I cannot relate
Riding with some tags that I got from outta state
Riding with a swag that I got from outta space
Just show me who's the hottest I'mma knock 'em outta place
Call me "Homicide Drizzy", I'm about to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goodie like I'm Cee-Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While a Houston stripper pole dance in a Z-ro
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-Pass is as valid as can be
I'm, I'm so fresh the stylist would agree
Waving at your girl while she smiling back at me
I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
These days
I've met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think about how I have failed to change all of my ways, ohh
These days
I've stopped the dreaming
I don't do too much scheming these days
These days
I sit inside a chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars these days
These days
I should be downtown, trippin on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is this that got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinions on me
I was only gone for the last two months
But you don't have the time to wait on me
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I can do
But that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're throwing dirt on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
Cause you don't mean them anyway
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way
We need to breathe
There's more to life than hearing stuff and being mean to me
We had to let go of us to show ourselves what we can be
But that just didn't sit well with me
Tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Throwing dirt on my name, in public
You don't feel no way, on purpose
I'm messing up all of Drake's words, on purpose.. careful
Careful
Be careful
Be careful
You could never be too careful
(I'm not a singer but BBC got me up very early in the morning)
Keep ya head away from windows
Keep your arms inside the ride
Trust me with ya body, trust me with ya life
Banging on the windows, baby come inside
Certainly in trouble, maybe you should hide
I'mma tell you like
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way
Instead of the other way
Feel a way, feel a way, young parents feel this way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way
Instead of the other way
...Social Experiment
You know I wake up like a king, get up, stunt
Take advantage of the day, this shit won't happen more than once
Know I’m ready for whatever, ready for the action
I’m still focused on my shit but girl I’m up for a distraction
Got a body like a stripper, but tell me she a student
But some strippers are students, so I tell her ass to prove it
Ya know, yeah show me all your books and some id or somethin'
I just wanna know that you can teach me somethin'
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
They telling me lies
They like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined."
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
It's like
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
"Tell Me Lies" - Scene 2
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
And now they like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined."
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
Cause the fabrication would help to settle that
And imagination would ease the pain
I came into this world as honest and pure
But can't guarantee to you that I'mma leave the same, so
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Can't figure out how I'm supposed to make it now
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
(Tell me lies)
Tell me anything but the truth
Can't figure out how I'm supposed to make it now, tell me lies
I said, tell me lies
Aww yeah Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothin' realer
Just enough will solve ya problems, too much will kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all is still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all that's why I strive for it
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party I get fly for it
I know that it's comin', I just hope that I'm alive for it
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to run away from home
But I left somethin' in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2"
And 48 hours all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got po'd up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantoms leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress is like a dead end
My girl love me but fuck it, my heart beat slow
And right now, the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week so
It's good but I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want the—
It's 10 O'clock on a Wednesday and I know your home
Drivin up and down your street
Hopin that you'll come outside
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me
Childish as it seems, it'll make it all better, better
Selfish as it is, this just ain't about you no
Did me wrong every time we were together, -gether
And that's why
I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could've made it all on my own
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man
Squad goin' up, nobody flippin' packs now
I just did 3 in a row, them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound, you know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time to party on the weekend
Tell Gelo, "Bring the juice, we about to get lit"
Fill the room up with some "tings", one night off and this is it
Always workin' OT, overtime and outta town
Shit is crazy back home, it kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep; shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got xan's in an Advil bottle, I don't take them shits
But you do, so I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills, I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think how we have the club going up
Trap, TrapMoneyBenny (trap)
This shit got me in my feelings (City Girls!)

Niggas think it's sweet (Nah, never), it's on sight (Yeah, what?)
Nothin' nice (Yeah), baguettes in my ice (Aw, man)
Jesus Christ (Yeah), checks over stripes (Yeah)
That's what I like (Yeah), that's what we like (Yeah)
Lost my respect, you not a threat
When I shoot my shot, that shit wetty like I'm Sheck (Bitch!)
See the shots that I took (Ayy), wet like I'm Book (Ayy)
Wet like I'm Lizzie
I be spinnin' Valley, circle blocks 'til I'm dizzy (Yeah, what?)
Like where is he? (Yeah, what?)
No one seen him (Yeah, yeah)
I'm tryna clean 'em (Yeah)
She's in love with who I am
Back in high school, I used to bus it to the dance
Now I hit the FBO with duffels in my hands (Woo!)
I did half a Xan, 13 hours 'til I land
Had me out like a light (Like a light)
Like a light (Like a light)
Like a light (Like a light)
Like a light
Yeah. Ho!
It's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!
Do that dance. Do that Dance
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
Look I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'mma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'mma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'mma change, yeah this Summer is grown
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh
Yeah because you special baby
Yeah this the remix right here

Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot (x4)
Are we done?
I don’t know, are we?
*pops champagne*
You would think it's all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
You hit me like “I know you’re there with someone else"
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text
I want to get straight to the climax (straight straight to the)
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back
Cause you talk like you got what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze
Talk like you bet it all on me
And you can’t take no L’s off me
I know you been...
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
I know you been working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful
And I fuck with you
So if you really fuck with me
Get as freaky as you wanna be, girl it's up to you
And she hit me with that "I don't do this normally, but for you I'll make exceptions"
Let's see what's next then
And it makes so much sense now (I need you to cum)
Girl it makes so much sense now (told you to leave)
You know that I'm gon' make sure now (need you to know)
Make sure, make sure (cum before me)
Make sure, make sure (I need you to cum)
Make sure, make sure (told you to leave)
You know I gotta make sure, gotta make sure (need you to know)
Make sure, make sure (cum before me)

Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion

What up, Lupe?
Chi-Town, check
My style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barely remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay, but check
It gets boring growing up in Memphis
Tryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would've done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
Luckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse
So every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
And plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first
If I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She said, "You need to be doing something other than skatin'
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
I'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'"
So now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
Playing chess, looking through some old school record ads
He knew I didn't really wanna post here
Opened up the window and told me that the coast clear
And now I coast clear, take a deep breath
Feeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
This is each test life's ever given me
A-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a
Kick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
The kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
Think it's obvious that they need my soul
My cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
I said, "Auntie, this is a safe career"
She said, "Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here"
So I kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push Coast
Fast as the wheels replaced
I gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
So I kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Coast
Peep the way I roll
Just a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
So I kick Then push
And coast
D-D-D-Do that
I got friends with money, and I got money too

Celebratin' Father's day every day so don't get sonned
Where you tryna go, I'm ready
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady
I'm chillin' out with T and Jay and Nico
My city ain't a city that support they own people
But I run it, you say something about it, I doubt it
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it
I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm standing on these couches sayin'
"Bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch!"
Pardon me, that was rude
If you just started balling I say I'm 'bout to conclude
What more is there to do
And why I would pretend
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND' (damn)
I got friends with money, and I got money too

Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'
And I'm callin' your bluff
Don't act like you can't see my dialin'
Never embellish, believe 'em 'cause he ain't exist
The stars on my team but I lead the league in asist
Never been a believer that previously exist
I wonder what I be doin' when previously is this
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Don't I treat you better than your old man?
He couldn't have done it like this sho' nuff
I tend to dro puff
I'm throwed and I'm high
I guess I'm throwed up
Tone it all down

Look, she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
Crib was 2 mil, plus I just bought a couch for ten grand
Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be without my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use 'em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And I'm a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center
Nice guys finish last so I'm winnin every race that I enter and she a
Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a...
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself
My old girl would say
Look at Vida Guerrera
There's no need to compare her
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet she's out meetin' directors instead
And frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin as if its your only option
Girl there's things to do
Other than jail time
Look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I won't back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
Look, I got a message, I'll say it
I got some beats still
Regina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will
You got an audience believe it or not
My cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill
Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
You've got some vacation time
You and your girlfriend too badmind
Bad, bad, bad, when you're both combined
I don't get how you look so nice
Girl, you're not nice, you're rude
Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, girl, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude (so rude)
Look what you're putting me through
I'd never do this to you
I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time, yeah
I need to hold the corner (corner) and then slow whine it
One time, yeah
Right now we're just taking time
Other things are on your mind
And you want bad, bad, bad when I treat you right
I don't care how you look so nice
Girl, you're not nice, you're rude
Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, girl, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude (so rude)
Look what you're putting me through

I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time, yeah
I need to hold the corner (corner) and then slow whine it
One time, yeah
'Cause, girl, you're not nice, you're rude
Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, girl, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude (so rude)
Look what you're putting me through
I'd never do this to you
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, but now it's gone
Out of the darkness, in came the carnage
Threatening my very survival
Fractured my streets and broke all my dreams
Now feels like defeat to wretched retreat
Fighting to eat
And we wondering
If we'll be free
We can not wait for some faithful day
It’s too far away so right now I’ll say
All that we've been through and now there is more
I hear them say love is the way
Love is the answer that's what they say
But were not just dreamers of broken down grievers
A hand will reach us and will not forsake us
This can't control us, no it can’t hold us down
We gon' pick it up even though we still struggling
And we wondering
Battant pour nos vie
We patiently wait for some other day
That's too far away so right now I say
How come when the media stops covering
And there’s a little help from the government
We forget about the people still struggling
And assume that its really all love again, nah
See we don’t have to wait for things to break apart
If you weren't involved before, it’s never too late to start
You probably think that it’s too far to even have to care
Well, take a look at where you live, what if it happened there?
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason that they see their flag rise again
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
Then it goes back
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a waving flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back
Side pieces
I know that you're watching this from home
I can't wait to see you on the road
Cheering from the shadows I hear you calling out
Wifey sees a text and asks what's this all about
I tell her you're just a friend
A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end
I'm asking would you be mine
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45
I had a rough game I took two shots I was 0 for 2
Tough day I need that one thing only you can do
Skylar this is the one thing that I'd be for you
This goes out to all my side pieces
Side pieces, side pieces
This goes out to all my side pieces
You know that you'll never be the main one
City to city I see you we're in the same one
Side pieces, side
Los Angeles I want you to make some noise for the real king of side pieces Brian McKnight one time
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog
Said I got my city buzzin
You should take a trip and view it
Shout out to Mr.Rogers
Cuz he's supposed to chop and screw it
And my liscense just expired
So I got to go renew it
Cuz I just bought a truck
And I am dying to debut it
And naw it ain't a Buick
I never rendezvous it
I'm just in the 'Burg with Trigga
And I'm faded off the fluid
I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the fuck you wanna do it
My nigga you better do it(Aye)...do it
I would say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I fuck with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drop it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia and coppertone
And girl I heard your man a fed, don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Ain't one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city, got 'em open like the lock is gone
Keys out, I ain't talking white though
Baby what you be's 'bout
I mean for tonight hoe
If I break them trees out
Pull them Double D's out
So I can J Holiday that ass
Before I leave's out
Holla at me shawty
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner
'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'ma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
I wanna see what's under there baby
Who's that peekin' in my window
You should let some more skin show
And if one of these websites get the info
We can work it out, no Nintendo
I just hit Alt, Tab
Switchin' in between two convos
I should just call cabs
And bring 'em both here to the condo
Yeah, normally it ain't a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose a connection
Cause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talk that shit, I just hit the escape key
And then she get mad and wanna go and erase me
And I remember Amy, she used to AIM me
She stayed up late and used to blame me
She said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me
I told her even Photoshop couldn't change me
But you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie
We ain't even tryna settle, so why try
End the night with a kiss and a bye bye
No strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi
Baby, not a day goes by, whoa
Without you on my mind, whoa
Donna Karan underwear
Babe, I swear you have nothing to worry about
Baby, I wanna see what's under there
It's easy, look lemme explain
Oh baby, yeah baby
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you
Uh, ok I’m all about it, all for it
I’m all star team Jordan, small forward
I’m never putting up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so I’m shooting if I draw for it
Pow, Pow, fuck is up, naw man I’m in this ho
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I’m in it for
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me
Wondering if I’m the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas
Girls wanna fuck you, niggas gotta wanna be you
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just don’t believe you
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you
Uh, uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don’t believe you
The movie starts with Drake and his girl laying in bed, kissing each other.
EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT
The image cuts to black and shows a drone view of the apartment building.
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
The image cuts to the interior of the apartment again, with Popcaan giving a toast.
The movie then cuts to a series of images while the movie's title (PLEASE FORGIVE ME) flashes in between
CUTS TO: EXT. PARTY - NIGHT
Drake and his girl are shown dancing in the middle of the party as people dance with boxes, brooms and other objects. The image cuts to Drake's girl walking into the party only to be stopped by a sinister man
SINISTER MAN: I'd like to discuss something with you. One million dollar.
TITLE SCREEN
CUTS TO: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
Drake and his girl are talking about the sinister man that approached her earlier at the party
DRAKE: And I mean of course he's gonna come up to you, y'know, what's new? Every guy comes up to you. What'd he say?
DRAKE'S GIRL: He say that if I want to sleep with his boss for one million dollar. And I was like "you're crazy man."
DRAKE: You should do it.
DRAKE'S GIRL: What?
DRAKE: You should do it, that's easy. One night, one million dollars. (Drake starts kissing his girl) Huh? That's an easy ting.
Hahahahaha

Lets go
Well alright, well alright
Look
Uh
Feeling sorry for the runner up
I’m still awake, getting money while the sun is up
And they keep saying how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie star doesn’t put the numbers up
Man, hate is so passé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day
Nigga and it’s just me and my money
Ya don’t even get to play when ya’ll leading by 20
Yeah I infiltrated the game
I was hesitant at first and fear what it would change
Now I’m high off the success and faded off of the fame
And still managed to keep all of my opinions the same
I am so far gone bitch I'm outta here
Hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killing shit I'm killing shit
Shout out to the niggas I just made a couple million with
Yeah from the beginning to the end
Know I’m into making history not into making friends
Muthafuckaaaa…
Grips on your waist
Unruly me say
This sound just done the place
Streets not safe
Papi never run away
Even when he's away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Poppy got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over
Said I need a one dance
Poppy got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know

Strength and guidance

Unruly gang, worldwide ting
Don't know why they still try me
Bun Vegas, he cyaan reply me

Unruly time
That's why I need a one dance
Drizzle got the machine in his hand

Watch the whole dance get turned over
Said I need a one dance
Poppy got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over, say
Yeah
J–j–j–just in my zone, I close my figures up
All your hoes chose me, nigga, calm down (yeah)
Louis pouch across my body, this is not for fashion
This is not a playground – ain't no fist fight, bitch, I'm blastin'
Niggas say they lookin' for me like I'm not right here, man
If I tatted tears, I'd be cryin' to my beard, man
Bitch, I'm tryna fuck, I've been inside for thirteen years now
I've been on so many flights, it's like my record's clear now
A.k.a. the man, a.k.a. I never ran
Don't make me turn this red light on your head like you Roxanne
Only talk to bosses, not the second-in-command
Niggas bringin' talks to me, you better have a plan
'Cause they don't have a cure for all my pain
A.k.a. it's Not Nice and I live up to my name
Yah, yah! Diss The Boy? Are you insane?
I drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range
That way, when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim
A.k.a it's Not Nice and it's not a fuckin' game
Gyah, gyah! You and I, we're not the same
Posted like Ibaka, got your wifey runnin' brains
She was there with boydem, kicked my front door off the frame
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Trap, trap, trappin' in the rain
She say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain
Just know I'm a shooter first and rap is not my thing
A.k.a. it's Not Nice and I live up to my—
Yeah
Right
Ahhhhhh
Aiight
I'm bout to do my thing
You ready?
Here I go!
October's very own
Drizzy
Taz You ain't even got nothin to worry about man
Check
Yeah
Are you listening?
Is anybody listening?
Walk into a room and you can smell the Clive Cristian scent
A lot of niggas is threatened by my positioning
Thrillin bars you think I'm writing with John Ghrisam
Pen
I need Rose, nevermind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom no license
Fuck if you're feelin me as long as your wife is
No one in my city gotta pocket like Drizzy
I can rock fitted Jeans cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black and covers all incidentials
And Ms. Rhone sorry you ain't notice my potential
Fuck ya rappers and your self-proclaimed status
I can only see green now happy St.Patty's
I know you waitin on a last quote
Check the soundscan and you can see that I'm the last hope
By the way I'm Jewish and turnin 22
Get's depressing when you see your favorite rappers
Goin through it
Tryna re-invent themselves, showin' no improvement
Gettin' crushed by this light skinned young'n on some
New shit
40 just recorded and who dropped this here
Cos I'm tryna fuck Megan Fox this year
And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
And you are in my age bracket, you are not my peer
Fuck you really know about a Eames couch
Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake, but a nigga's livin' ya dreams out
Lookin like a photoshoot everytime the team's out
And is the realest nigga still I
A woman could love me to death but I'd still die
So I'm about us now
Smith and Wesson flow
You should tell them boys duck down
Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
(You're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause
I'm from the city where people be gettin' lazy
Litterin' in the streets
And the club district is poppin' like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers
Money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams
And dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events
Bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot
So girls'll give up the ass
And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like Snoopy and Woodstock
Daffy and Bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane
And she back where she was
Right back on the bus
It's a shame cause now at his window
She throwin' bricks like Shaq in the clutch
You can see that's shes colder
'Cause he doesn't hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her
That he couldn't mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say
Now up north there's five artists deservin' a listen
And I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
But if you gotta think through
Chances are that it ain't you
I single-handedly carry out what you can't do
And see I take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple that's eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in & the out and the plan's seeming ill
Whenever I'm out in Memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like I'm Andreena mill
Japan and Brazil, the audience screaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh
Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
(You're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause
On the hood you see the Stallion, passenger a stallion
Niggas gettin' nervous, I'm passin' out the Valium
I suggest you pop it, but please don't get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerkin' up in 400 West Peachtree
Bet you those same hoes'll see me, be like that's how you feelin'?
Used to stay up at The Twelve, now you're worth like 12 million
Boy, you did it, boy, you did it, you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected, I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fuckin' women that knew Biggie, so it really ain't no biggie
It's just OVO and XO, and Freebandz the committee
And shout out to Toronto, bitch, I'm Tony in my city, huh
Oh no, no, no
Divas, y'all help me sing this next verse
Here we go
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
I'm a, I'm a a diva, I'm a, I'm a a diva (I need them bags of that money)
I'm a, I'm a a diva, I'm a, I'm a a diva (You see the mask, where that money?)
(I need them bags of that money)
Me and you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
'Cause mine's it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like
(Plug)
I'm back, baby, where the love?
(Bitch)
Ayy, yeah
Ayy, ayy (Plug)
Writin' this from Florida with love (Love)
Rest in peace to Static, yellin' "Shawty want a thug," ayy
Bottles in the club, ayy, know I love to touch (Ayy)
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus
Bottles in the club, ayy, know I love to touch (Ayy)
Weezy played that shit for me and Kobe on the bus (Yeah)
Went and got a chain for me, I had to give it up (Yeah)
Niggas had they pistols loaded pointed at my truck, ayy
And you know that lesson stuck (Right)
From that day I never touched the road without a (Plug)
Ayy, from that day I never saw the point in talkin' tough (Nah)
Hasn't happened since, I guess you niggas know what's up (Yup)
Yeah, haven't seen the 6ix in like a month (6ix)
Fuck that, I'm back, baby, where the love? (Love)
Rappers that I threw an alley-oop are throwin' subs (Yeah)
But they gotta dap me when they see me, that's what's up (That's what's up)
I let that shit slide, I got everything
I can lose it all if I'm reactin' to the petty things
My bro named Casino, yeah, but he ain't into bettin' things
FBG the gang and they down to stain anything, mhm
Yeah, that's right (Yeah, that's right)
FBG the gang and they down to stain anything (Stain)
Mhm (Stain), yeah, that's right (Yeah, that's right)
FBG the gang and they…
Booted up, turned up, piped up (Plug)
I'm back, baby, where the love? (Where the love at?)
I'm back, baby, where the love? (Where the love at?)
I'm back, baby, where the love?
Booted up, turned up, piped up (Plug)
I'm back, baby, where the love? (Where the love at?)
I'm back, baby, where the love? (Where the love at?)
I'm back, baby, where the love?
Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
It's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected
People just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
They just wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
That you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town
Chorus: (x4)
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
Than most of these rappers running the game
Certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a Range
Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted out late at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter
So this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..
Chorus: (x4)
I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!
R-E U-P G-A-N-G
R-E U-P G-A-N-G

But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Ugh, do what you do and I does what I does
These chicks love me, they say boy, you’re clean-cut for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush in the club
It’s like a offensive foul how they running to us
Charge all their drinks on that platinum card
Lord I got ‘em hooked like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am
I get the green, plus the eggs and ham
And a pen for any beef trying to approach us
Let the sucker burn, I don’t even flip 'em over
Nickelus F. teamed with Drake, now you mad as hell
Ain’t seen a better looking union since Gabrielle
Well, I'm hot as hell and I don’t even need a stylist
Spit the infernal like the Real World Challenge
V.A., Nickelus F., push your mileage
You’re running up our animals like white boys, they cow-tip
Everybody knows Cap from the south of Wallis
I ain’t gotta use a fist, slap you with the chalice
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
(I gotta spill on this)
That's why I roll up and tend to get high
Cause my arms won't extend to the sky
Peer pressure always make me feel lesser than a 10 in they eyes
So I can only grab my pen and advise
Street legends and chicks seem to wonder
Exactly who I am
You know me if you had a job at 16 and under yup
It's Drake and Saint Nick
Take a whiff of this and faint quick
Off a sample of the flow patient
But I don't lie to rhymers
I strip walls and apply the primer
If there's a wall I'm gon' try to climb-aaa
Without a graded rope
Our navy seal Buddies yelling slurs at me
I'm always gon find another way to go
I'm minty fresh with the Green like I'm made a bathing scope
No bathing ape but I'm clean Like I'm made of soap
Begging for the fire
Buglars in hear we
We all good in the fam we like Meagan and limiya
I dress like Lou, I sell verses to label
And they give me the next joint
To sound less like you
That's something I had to say before
I'm real picky with real with lyrics
So don't use joints you probably would pay me for
I ain't' a heat busser
What up to Denik Rusha and Bei Major, Trey Songz, the street's Usher
Leak tracks and heat wax and he bust ya
And then sign ya
This is a reminder
This along the lines of Thrill is Gone still the song
I'mma mention Jay even though I feel it's wrong
We gave good ambition homegirl couldn't listen
Now she want the Snackpack back and her pudding's missin'
Bring the topic back
Please don't stop the track
Tropicana never got the hammer by my jock in-fact, I keep my money there
Mixtapes where I top em at
DJ Smallz.com you can shop at that
Speak of shopping I'm tryna get a label deal
Tryna live my dreams while awake, tryna make the fables real
No stealing cable trying to have my cable still
Better yet stolen, my grammar is golden
My grammer go harder than most rappers
There's a certain female rapper I will expose and
For once I think you should tell yo mouth to get to closing
No I didn't pen that Freestyle shit
I got a session with Digs so the beef I'm gone end that
Anybody else get the piece that I bend back
Let it marinate if you niggas dare to hate
You tryna come up, I am the come up
I be standin' right here when the sun up
You be gettin' done up if you niggas try and run up
You livin' good, go 'head and throw your one up
You tryna come up, I am the come up
I be standin' right here when the sun up
You be gettin' done up if you niggas try and run up
You livin' good, go 'head and throw your one up
Scream out, blat-blat-blat-blatow, blat-blat-blat-blatow
Blat-blat-blat-blatow, how ya like me now?
I'm like blat-blat-blat-blatow, blat-blat-blat-blatow
Blat-blat-blat-blatow, how ya like me now?

She call me the referee, cause I be so official

Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money, yeah, yeah, you know who you are...
KD, I know you're here, I know you understand me
Real talent doesn't always win championships
Like real music doesn't always win Grammy's
But we're okay...
Honorable mention works for me and you
Honorable mention, hey, hey
You're lucky that LeBron finally had to lose
He gets an honorable mention, hey
It ain't so bad being number two
Yeah, season's over, just hold on you're going home
Can't deal with life's hurdles like you're Lolo Jones
Series over, feel the sorrow, drink it down
Bartender I think I'll have a Triple Crown
And I'm the only one, I think I'll be the only one
You ready
Iggy Azalea and Swaggy P
I love you both, you're like a poor man's Jay and Bey
You know what I'm saying?
Collin Kaepernick you know I love to see you flexing
It's just a damn shame that Michael Crabtree can't catch it
Danica you don't always come in first place we know
But somehow in Nascar you're the only face we know
Honorable mention
Honorable mention
Didn't win didn't lose
Just got a honor mention
And now the whole the whole U.S of A are soccer fans too
They get an honorable mention
But even in Brazil inspirational dreams don't always
Come true
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin' 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin' attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go
For the H-Town
Set up the occasion
I’m up in the place and
If amazing was a young bitch
I'd be going to jail cause I'm fucking amazing
What's up for the taking
I’m ready and I'm willing, why the fuck are we waiting
Yeah, and baby you should bring your best friend
Then you should persuade her to let me get some sex in
Don't get offended, baby, that's just a suggestion
Really we can do it however..you..like
I’m probably in your hotel tonight
Whatever floor that me and 40 staying on is smelling riiight
Yeah, just know we grinding till it’s light out
Show up in your city, turn that motherfucker right out
Yeah, tell me who controls kings
I don’t follow rules, stupid old things
I’m riding through the city in the coupe with those wings
My team deserves some motherfucking Super Bowl rings
Oh yeah, and I know we gon' get it
Me and Jeezy bout whatever, shorty, holla if you with it
Even though I want it to this shit don’t last forever
But better late than never, honestly I’d like to say it's been a pleasure
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin' 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin' attention

You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go
For the H-Town
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
Shoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda, coulda, wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin' my time
'Cause she heard it all
'Cause she heard it all
Girl, I coulda changed your life
But you heard it all
Well I'ma say it anyway
Shawty, I'm from the city
Where we were never taught to love
You ain't gotta be in love to fuck
Girl, I'm just tryna say
I'm from the city, oh
Where the money makes a difference
But it never made us different, oh
Man, you seen me in the fucking streets. You seen me in the ring. Rone Baby The Prince Soon To Be The King.Let's fucking go baby!Let's fucking go
All the way from Chicago, making his Toronto debut, battler to my left, introduce yourself
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck! Let's go. Y'all ready?
Yeah. Rone won the coin toss, Big T let's get it
You got no H for jabbing veins
You ain't slinging crack cocaine
You ain't seen a brick or a nic' since Patrick played
You ain't have Blue Magic since Magic contracted AIDS
You wouldn't draw on me if I was half a page of anime
You wouldn't draw on me if I was a connect the dots handout
You wouldn't draw on me if I was passed out in a frat house
I mean...
You have an imprint in your fat from the weapon on your waist
When you smile, it looks like your lips are being stretched across your face
You fucked up on Total Slaughter because of the glares of everyone there
Let me guess, it wasn't the first time you couldn't take the stares/stairs
And when I heard you got shot...I got jealousssssss
I mean, I'm glad you're not out on the streets dead
But if I got popped with a couple shots it would do wonders for my street cred'
I mean, who knew the Michelin Man was from Michigan Ave?
Too tired to walk, too fat to sit in the cab
And this is dinner for me
To you dinner's a snack
You got me G? Colostomy, I got this shit in the bag
Bro, after these fireworks, he'll be calling up life alert
Getting a ride to church, reading his favorite Bible verse
His wife will squirt and then leave him after I make him bite the curb
He'll get a career and have to wear a Hawaiian shirt and tie to work
And the boss at his new office
I bet he, ain't gon' fuck around
So you'll have to change your name from Big T to Big Button Down
And what kind of future is that?
What kind of lose is that?
When you're forever known as "The dudes who's fat who used to rap."
Quiet, let's go bitch
So I don't give a fuck if he out from the mid-west
His delivery is as gentle as a fucking midwife
Bro I can't even hang with T cause son's stressing
He thinks everything is a drug or a gun reference
Like I said, "Molly, Miley and Nina's in the back of the whip."
He said, "Pills, coke and a nine?" I said, "No. Actual chicks."
If I say "Crystal and Mary Jane" he ain't thinking names of women
If I fucking talk about my cell plan
He's thinking about escapes from prison
Listen
If I say "ratchets" I'm talking about tools
If I say "cans" I'm talking about booze
If I'm gon' ride it's probably a cruise
If I got white it's the sock in my shoes
But you acting like your squads snapping
You all wood like a log cabin
And that big arm like Tom Savage
But my strategy is John Madden
You got sound effects in your rounds well then homie you should stop rapping
We in Toronto, Capo, leave it to Scott Jackson
But I mean...
But, but me and T...fucking...
Did brawl once the fucking sound effects were crazy
We fucking went all out it was right in front of his lady
I mean he came out with that chic chic trying to let that big thing ring
But I came back with the sword I was like shwing shwing shwing
It was your black friends buddy that stood up like, "Leave that kid alone!"
See, you didn't care if our dads weren't at home
Their loyalty was like your real name
If needed them fam to get 'em/Adam for Rone
Damn wigger
You lying in your voice
You playing Simba
Your N.W.A. CD skip last night at the hotel and I heard you saying "nigga"
I heard you, you was saying "nigga"
Scalp you with a scalpel, approach me and I'm spraying ya
Have Adam's apple surgically removed like a transgender
You a puss homes
That battle with Pay Stay wasn't gay, it just look wrong
Like, are y'all fucking for real?
No, are y'all fucking for real?
He had you took home
You talking loud, that silencer on that {chic chic} clone
Without tux, you finally get a tie or two to match
When I go at Pat Stay and Rone it's on
It's time to stop the show
Breaking news
I knew you was going to come with the typical practical jokes
April Fools
I'm spraying tools the rules that the Navy use
But this ain't what it's taking to
You gonna come to get popped, Taken 2
Save the ooohs
This round, I take the boos
I'm playing in school like oooh, "he got them new Jordan 2s? Let's take his shoes."
We got older, put mother and daughter in a sacred room
One live, one die nigga, make 'em choose!
Fuck it, kill yourself for all I know
I point that can' at her, that big boy is Ontario
But there ain't no where to run though
Now that was a reach, I ain't gon' lie
But I'm reaching for another gun pronto
Drake Started From The Bottom beat, you gon' get it from Mahalo (a hollow)
See, we all know a whole bunch of shit that you could say about me
If I was you, I'd have all my shit took away
You could say
"Big T, what you know about studying for a test that's a month away?
You had to go to school, your dad made you read a book a day
The whole book a day
No B's, you only could get A's
Cause if you didn't get good grades you got all your privileges took away."
You could be like, "Big T
What you know about being mad when McNabb couldn't play
Cause if it was a mistake my dad used to beat my mom ass and I had to look away."
Like, "He didn't mean to fumble that last play it was a mistake."
All you hear is {bbbbbrrr bbbbrrr clap clap} "Leave her alone dad for goodness sakes!"
What you know about Adam having the same face as mine
Cause I'm Adam junior and he's Adam senior he had the same face as mine
So if I lose the disgrace is mine
So first place was mine cause you had somebody there to motivate you every time
I wouldn't know about that
QUIET nigga!
I wrote this verse sittin' in my new car
Sometimes where you headed is too far
It’s more about where you are
And I am, everywhere where that you wish you could be
Somebody, somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is how we're all ending up
I’m at the label in the elevator, send 'em up!
(Crown)

Daddy taught me gotta love my haters
Sister taught me how to speak my mind
My man make me feel so God damn fine

You said you're over me, now you're all over me
Buzzin' your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
I know, you know, I'm in too deep to let it go
I know, you know, it’s in my nature to get distant
I know it's been a year since I left you alone
Unfortunate, I think you know there's somethin' missin'
But you never say shit, don't know how to take it
We're good on our own, but
I miss being on Wiltshire at your place, and
I drink you under tables, got you misbehavin'
Buzzin' in your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me

Yeah, look
Me and Sos, we from two different walks of life
Mutually we understand there's a problem, we don't talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green
That's sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
But don't try and tell me that a dolphin's white
Mislead Drake, that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin' like no time
They'll be tryna sub a nigga in like Quizno's
What we doing Drake? (We bag jackin, bitches!)
What we doing Drake? (We bag jackin, bitches!)
Take your whole bag of candy, leave you in the cold
So bring the ruckus if you under 12 years old
It's 7:58 and now your curfew is pushin
Watch how just like Republicans I'm behind the bushes
"It wasn't me" - if you asked me, that's what I'mma tell ya
And I'mma eat so much chocolate, my blood type's Nutella
Got wanted signs from madd parents, state troopers
Kidnapped Willy Wonka and bitch-slapped an Oompa-Loompa
Give me your Reese's Pieces, give me your Hershey bars
I want your Milky Way, give me that Snickers bar
I would Trick-or-Treat but I'm too old now
So I snatch your bag so I don't look like a pedophile
My sticky fingers got all of these mamas mad at me
We're talking stomach aches, restraining orders, cavities
I probably won't have no teeth when I'm finished
I don't pay for the porcelains, I just marry my dentist
Ho, yeah, uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy
Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her
One, two, three, four
Yeah, I'm outside in a AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby, yeah, you know me
Still with the ones that I grew beside
All the people 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
I'm outside in an AMG, yeah
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby, yeah, you know me
Who am I? All the people 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby, yeah, you know me
I just hit up shorty on my Insta
Just threw on a hoodie, it's a Crenshaw
Way that I been livin' unconventional
I'm just tryna make it to the end, you know
Certain things just started gettin' tenser
Think we need to have us an adventure
I could be your girl but maybe down the road
Right now I would rather see my heart turn to chrome
Rather see my heart turn crystal
I can't even front like I don't miss ya
Right now I'm just stuck inside the crib on my own
Soon as I free up, I'm 'bout to pop up on your phone like
I'm outside in a AMG
Right outside, TT
Too turnt, baby, yeah, you know me, yeah
Who am I? All the people 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by
Too turnt, baby, yeah, you know me, yeah
Heart's still on javelin, baby
Too turnt, baby, yeah, you know me
I was pullin' off 'fore they knew me
Sometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me
When it was you and me, yeah
I feel like I love you too much to change you
You believe in angles more than angels
Feel like I've been going through too much to explain to you
But I'm still the same way I was when I came to you
Everything I have, what I had to exchange for you
Everything I've been through, I can't even complain to you
Wish it stayed the same for you, sorry
Uh-uh, I'm sorry, oh
I'm outside in a—
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Too turnt, baby, yeah, you know me
Know me, oh-I
Ayy-yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, too turnt, baby, yeah, you know me
Uh, too turnt, baby, yeah, you know me
Oh-I
Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
I write so, I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ISO
What is about to unfold, no tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though, I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw, that is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world, got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like "I ain't getting service in your area"
You be like "Nigga get your bars up"
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong, I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch, holla at me baby! (look)
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
How was your night pop?
It was, uh... it was alright. Shit's just crazy man. The whole energy out here is just changing, you know, it's just getting dark man, quick. It's like mans are on the road it feels like as if anybody is a target, you know, you just don't know where it's gonna come from, can't even gauge it man. It's like I go from that, trying to balance that to just balance my own sanity, drinking more, smoking more, you know staying up so late that it's early, like fuck. I'm not losing it though, you know, I'm just venting, I'm not like worried, it's already too late for these guys trust me, I'm just more worried about myself you know, I just gotta come home.
JUNGLE
??: What's the day today?
??: October 2nd, 2008
??: I'mma take the same video, on October 2nd 2009 and see if we can get in this thing without ID (?)
Southern Smoke
It's Southern Smoke baby!
(Money) Frank Dukes
(Money) My man Nickelus F
(Money) Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
(Money) This is the remix right here
(Money) So if you got some (Money)
Put ya hands in the air
(Money) Southern Smoke
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for freeee
And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me, homie
Okay I just got back from another label meeting and
I ain't what they looking for I ain't what they looking for
I ain't really Atlanta I ain't really Brooklyn or
I dont fit the appeal for them shows that they could book him for
Straight nigga tryna get in through a crooked door
Barely fittin in cuz a gimmicks what they took him for
But getting doubted caused me to reroute it
To another destination where the people they abouuut ittt!
You ever felt high above it all?
Run your fingers through the clouds like the sky about to fall?
Treat me like I'm rich when I'm about ball
And think once about the clothing that I buy up out the Mall
I'm famous so I get approached fast, Louie and Coach bags
All up in coach class, gem like Topaz, cool like slow Jazz
Dope like coke lines and crack like broke glass
I promise this is me, me
I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you
Yea
Ok, I'm floating in my zone without a scheduled descend
The rising and the fall was never my intent
I want this shit forever printed in cement
And if I ever sin I promise to repent
I'm only tryin to win I ain't tryna present
You gotta listen close like it's coming through the vent
These rappers can't see me I live behind the tint
And just to get a visual them niggas gotta squint
There I ammmm
Little me in row 23F real reconize real is there none of yall left?
Everybody in the game can't none of yall ref?
And filter out the bullshit the fuck is yall def?
You'r now tuned in to the new comer of this summer
The Chris Paul of this fall exist yall - Yea
And is the realist nigga still I?!
A bitch could love you to death and you still die
Ahhh!
I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit is wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you
(Crowd Clapping and Applause)
Yea
Whats goin on yall?
I wanna thank yall for coming out tonight
I go by the name of Drake
I got my man Slakah The Beatchild here
My man Hazel
You already know we about to rock tonight
So if you with me clap ya hands
I'm about to tell you a secret, as long as you can keep it
Between me and you
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again (Six-six-six!)
Soon as you get in
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel
And don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care
Don't over-prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way
But, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
Planned this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone, so they'll never know
But I might tell you one day, you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel and don't worry 'bout doing your hair
Or what you should wear, this not a video shoot, I don't care
Don't over prepare
Gotta remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way, but just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you, j-just be ready to go
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you
Damn, another 20 missed calls
I love her and I hate her
It's a funny twist y'all
Can't stand her it when she in town
But miss her when she gone
Truth be told
I'd rather be with her than alone
But fights break out
And neighbors call 5-0
Screamin you the most foul bitch I know!
Forever mine wherever I go
Sex pistols out (bang) die slow
Nah die slower than that
Just co-llapse all over my matt-ressss
Who shot cha that nigga ain't finished
So once again I find myself in it (click-clack)
Just let me take a minute
Round 2 is in the chamber
All you gotta do is spin it
Aim for the heart
Battle of the sexes
All's fair love and war casualties expected
Alright well, um, alright. We... we'll fuckin' figure it out. You know what you—you know what you're doin' with it, you know, makin' it to the top. All the way to the top. Yeah, you do it for the money, and not the honey, you know what I'm sayin'? You know what I'm sayin'?
Part of me wish that I could meet with all you haters in person
They got a lot of feelings for me they just ain't certain
How to express themself when I walk into the club
And take stares like the fuckin elevators ain't workin
Yea
Cuz they know the promoter paid you
You wouldn’t have come if someone hadn’t of made you
You just lookin forward to seein woman that played you
And shittin on the men they get engaged to
I swear it’s like
Uh
More confidence and less fear
We can discuss it further when yall manage to get here
Diddy here, o here, skinny here, rex here
And we just havin one of those conversations about next year
Ima kill it I promise this I know you mad
Ive always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't asking for much all I want is the
Yeah
And I don't know if I can do that with you, so...
Took if from signing my own yearbook to booked for the year
Got a condo and I couldn’t even cook for you here
Took it from bs checks to TSX
To people wondering if its the Phantom he gets next
Who knows, its the rabbit its buzzing for real here
The rapper everybody got a cousin he’s feeling
Its kinda ironic you fit with them
Cause they wasn’t really around when it wasn’t appealing
Now its denim diamonds an perfume spraying
Four star rooms are the worst you stay in
(I love the line about the range with the rims to match)
What girl that wasn’t me who’s verse you saying
Shit I would never tell you nothing like that
Them other niggas you spend on, cuff em like that
See the difference with me I don’t forget the past
And you gave me nothing so I’m gonna give you nothing right back, like…
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was…
Young, dumb, looking in the mirror
Trying to figure out who Im gonna be this year
Its funny you managed to be around for the present
All puns intended your funds are mended
If I take back the cheddar it'll better for both us
No debts owed we can both let go
Before this I could never get a call from ya
Now all texts finish XOXO
But this ain't hollywood squares to me
Sweetie I’m far from a hollywood charity
And I bet when you talking to your friends
You messing with other dudes that you probably compare to me
But if its not Drake and one of us wrong you forget my birthday and know none of my songs
You coulda told me before your heart wasn’t in it, fine
But try to get a start at the finish line
Ah
Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny I’m the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I…
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was…
I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? ’cause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring you to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I’m blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
Probably one of my realest loves ever
Four page letters, and time is all better
‘Cause time heal whatever
Ima need a moment ’cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, Females are on a regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friend with benefits till we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like “one more chance”, more problems no biggie ah
It’s all good don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give eachother space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that (all that)
Tell your friends they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? ’cause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I’m blunt, but how real is that
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still…
Uh, ain’t no, ain’t nobody like you
Heard you gotta ballplayer, but he don’t excite you
I ain’t the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Uh, still a, still a superfreak
You know how it be when I’m rolling in the sheets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Genuine, ’cause I’m the same O G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies
Arguing in Barney’s, fly shit, too much pride to say sorry
Problems ruined like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave, but she wanna stay
She like, how you feeling babe?
Like, like, shit
I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? ’cause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring you to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I’m blunt, but how real is that
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still
Chorus:
I still got it for ya x6
And even though we let it go, it's better that you know
I still got it for ya x6
And even though we let it go, it's better that you know I still
Wild things you're doing at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doing it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as the real thing
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
What are you doing lately?
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
You know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You know
That's not the way to get over me
I can't recover from all this conversation
You called me weak and you testing my manhood as we yell at each other
You wanted me to go and put my hands on you just to show you I love you
Just know I can jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you said, despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You acting out, you know you love to see a young nigga suffer
You, you, you know, know, know
That's not the way to get over me
That's not the way to get over
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
You know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're saying
You know
That's not the way to get over me
Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that They'll buy
Now I'm out in A-Town
They tellin' me Trey sound
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train
Dog, personally mane
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they purposeless game
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game
I keep on, on, on, on, on
I'm killin' 'em all, all
Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda
Ol' time killin'
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin'
And now the girls like
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin'
They one in the same when you need it to happen
My city full of players they just needed a captain
In need of him right now in need of him back then
But back then I was actin'
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men
And now whoever chose to back out is back in
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold
And keep on, on, on, on, on
Uh, yeah man, uh
I feel real good right about now
I feel like im, im making a return
I ain't even been gone yet I ain't even
Taken a leave of absence but I feel like I'm back
Yeah man
Check, I roll with the coalition, when no one listened
I spoke out now niggas is throwing this in
You gassed up, my vehicle low emission
I can enter your field trip with no permission
Slip, i've done it before told ya I run it before
Now the city is mine, and what you thought it would be
Ain't a rapper working harder than me I put my heart in T
Uh, ?, carry the city on my back like a Jansport
Or even in a victor bag, so if you quick to brag then u get clipped to tag
Homie, u make a lot of music niggas ain't feeling
You rappers shouldn't rap, you rappers should paint ceilings
That's why I ain't competitive y'all, cuz deep down I know im much better than y'all
Watchu mean do I actually flow, wanna know if I actually flow just ask V-O
Im tryna make the wrist on my cousin ashley glow till she waken up by someone and it actually snow
Stop snitching if your man seen a killer, you never ever seen it, it can't seem familiar
We keep it on and poppin like the dance scene in Thriller
This the new version fresh prince and andreana miller
And d-10tion the boi-1da
And people focused on keeping the boy under
Probably cuz I don't act like y'all
And I ain't gotta sell crack like y'all
Well not really, I mean I do move crack in a disc form
But thats only because I don't rap like y'all
And now its occurring to them
Its starting to be my friend is reassuring to them
Either that or every verse im referring to them
So catch me in a zone till they leave me alone
Uh, yea, and its down south for the summer ima leave them at home
Uh, and thats just what it is
Uh, everybody that mess with me I see you
You feel me
Benard I see ya homie

K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
Making moves off the laptop

I won't expect you to move as fast as me
Cause I am way too experienced in this love game bitches
And I won't expect you to kiss me
Cause it just won't be everything you wanted and more for sure
And I don't do that cause it's just gonna lead to the touchin' lovin'
Ah baby baby
I'm gonna stop the braggin'
Because what we're gonna be having is
A Little bit this, a little that
And a little bit of boom tap, bap bap
Yeah yeah
And I ain't saying that you down
But I'm tryna turn that frown around
What if we happen to kiss, then we touch?
Put a rush on it
And get over with
What if I just know what you like and it feels right?
Then it's over with
What if I don't call you back, prove you right
And all this last just one night?
Maybe we should slow it down
Slow slow slow

Baby it's just you, me
Sittin' on the couch
And baby whatever you do, don't say ouch, ouch
Baby, why are you frontin'?
Baby you know that you love it yeah

But baby girl I'm the one that is here is with you
Right now, right now, right now
You got the crown
So fuck what they was talking about
Baby I need you too listen
I'm here to stay not to visit
Baby girl I know it's not a simple task
But you know I'm gonna ask

Maybe we should slow it down
Slow slow slow

Me and the girl
She innocent
I'm not so innocent
You guys know what it is though but uh
She shy, she real shy
She tryna put it like she, she too good for me
She know she ain't too good for me
Cause there wouldn't be conversation
We wouldn't be talking
She wouldn't have my number
I wouldn't have hers
She wouldn't be calling my number
Know what I mean? So
She at the crib winkin' and shit
And she, she know what she doing to me
I'm playing with it
I want it
I don't know how far she wanna go
But she ain't really finna going anywhere
So, this is just what to show what she can't have
And I'm also trying to understand, know what I mean?
Let me get back to the hook
What if we happen to kiss, then we touch?
Put a rush on it
And get over with
What if I just know what you like and it feels right?
Then it's over with
What if I don't call you back, prove you right
And all this last just one night?
Maybe we should slow it down
Know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
Because I’ve loved and I’ve lost
I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun, please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know, they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Because that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run from that, say you’re done with that
On your face girl, it just don’t show
When you’re ready, just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the parties over, just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry
You won’t ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
Know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
Because I’ve loved and I’ve lost
It’s my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
Because you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Because your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know
Know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
Because I’ve loved and I’ve lost
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost
Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world
Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do
Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis
Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
Fortunately I am at an elevated level
I'm celebrated at home and
I am high above it all
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious
Just wait 'til I get my money right and
I am going to ball ball ball
Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world
Shit's all good
The deal got signed
And my split's all good
And these haters pretending
That it's all good
Say that shit in person
Man I wish ya'll would
I'm a mothafucking genius goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you
I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat
If you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket
And these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me
Would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could of fooled me
And tell my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname started Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chilling in the cut, nigga what
And I'm feeling like
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
Here I go
Street report
Balling over here
We need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house look something like a resort
You can't resist being rich when you record
When this money run slower than Eyore
If your life is a movie you an extra
I'm so fly, I glide Clyde Drexler
Mr. Pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now
Fuck next up
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this

And I dare anybody to try and cut my wing
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand em

S 550 navigatin' where I gonna be
P.A.G. mother fucker don't forget the E
Rep T dot till they bury me
Audemars the wrist red diamonds in the necklace
Been getting' checks while you rappers stay checkless
Real street nigga feel free to do a checklist
They don't really make em like me
Had to give you a second to breathe
Nigga ballin' still a hobby and I do that with ease
I'm bout to catch pneumonia because my neck stay freeze
I'm in the west indies
A 100 grand on a cheap white tee
I'm the man in my city they demand at me
Nigga I rep for my city like a football team

In a G5 two nines on me like Wayne Gretzky
Alright, well alright

Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A picture won't do me Justice League in this bitch
I’ma do me trust this
Patience little label nigga you won't rush this
I got the hammer money sweetie you can’t touch this

Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motha fucking Mario
Yeah, and Polow isn’t at my session
Mr Anticipation Ima keep you niggas guessing like
Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn’t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE
I’m up too high somebody come get me down down down down
Said I’m up too high somebody get me down down down down
Look, my ex girl said she done dating black guys
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised
Not me I make your battle ships capsize
Get soaked get wet get baptized
I got the full package a nigga complete
I get bread and eat tracks like lunch meat
Sue me and Ima put you on front street
Probably get your records pushed back like front seats
I’m much more then you fathom he would be
And ain't too many niggas that I’d rather be than me
I guarantee the women getting at him would agree
That he should go ahead and put a patent on his g
And I swear these niggas gassed up even though the price is high
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly
You know my coupe sit super low
Top slipped off like Janet at the superbowl
Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn’t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE
Look I know girls love Beyoncé, girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing, and shawty you ain’t no different
These days it’s hard to meet women, feel like my love life is finished
I’ve been avoiding commitment that's why I’m in this position
I’m scared to let somebody in on this, no new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go, you got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone
But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name
Yeah, uh... Say my name, say my name, cause those other men are practice
And this ain’t no time for actin’, and this ain’t no time for games
And this ain’t no time for uncertainty, and this ain’t no time for locking your phone
And not coming home and startin’ some shit when I’m in the zone
This is why I’ve been saying, "no new friends, no no no"
You know how this shit goes, this is not four years ago
Time escapes me, now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and fuck these hoes”
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I’m just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that’ll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with cause we don’t wanna hide no more
Plus you’re not shy no more; neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I’m not alone, even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone, let me make you say my name, say my name
Shoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda coulda wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin’ my time
'Cause she heard it all
'Cause she heard it all
Girl, I coulda changed your life
But she heard it all
Well, I'ma say it anyway shawty

You ain’t gotta be in love to fuck
Girl, I’m just tryna say

Where the money makes a difference
But it never made us different, oh

Yeah, it's Drake, KC
Look, previously mischievous behavior
Was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some considerable degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But ugh, Keshia, Keshia do you remember the old us?
We would never be together, is what they told us
From immature kids to entrepreneur kids
We bought our own dreams instead of the ones they sold us
Keep it a hundred, what they sayin' I'm a liar for?
Airing laundry, that's what I got a dryer for
What are they even searching through attire for?
Tellin' you these stories bout lonely women that I ignore
Callin' them out is red rover to me
To them it's a dream, its just a rare rover to me
See I'm passionate and focused
I don't know how they expect a Scorpio born in October to be, but ugh
I'm going in, check
Look, previously mischievous behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But now, I need a culprit
I am talking lofts and beach condo adult shit
I am talking all day shopping sprees at the mall with, friends that I ball with, here meet T's girl, go and get some fall shit
Sweetie I am a tracks demise. I will kill this song until it actually dies
With a military jacket and some pack supplies
I won't say I'm the best until the stats arrive
And all these A-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside, its only slacks and ties
But you dont ever act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy until the plaques arrives
Thats why I love you
All I care 'bout is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it, I’m on one
Yeah, I said I’m on one, fuck it, I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'mma get that shit
Cause I’m on one, I said, fuck it, I’m on one
All I care 'bout is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done

Webby
Bars are still on me man

See I'm a beast
Always have been, always will be
Hungry, a seven course meal couldn't fill me
Wanna come and step to the flow then fucka feel free
I can make a lyricist look like Lil' B
Been in the game for a minute under your radar
Building my momentum for the moment that I'll take charge
My reflection still the same like spelling racecar
Now I've just come far enough to overcome the race card
Let me break it off proper
Freestylin' to your chick, yea take it off mama
I'm a professional showing you who really hotter
Gotta smaller chance of beating me than finding Jimmy Hoffa
Got a lot of people rolling with me how is it a shocker
That I made it to the top, spittin' out this molten lava
But now I'm fryin' rappers up like some cala-mari
Sorry, I'm chewin' any beat like a piranha
With the weed up in my paper or up in a Philly, fuck it
Until I'm on a beach with a margarita like Jimmy Buffet
I be spittin' these flows, time to really get it man
Snappin' like a gorilla wearing a silly band
Like a tattooed grizzly
Sick, representing Raccoon City
Playin' these shows, then I smash two bitties
Blazin' these flows 'til I stack two milli
Came up in the game like a certified hustler
Pedal to the metal 'til I'm burning my muffler
Fuck ya, everyday I stay smoking
My jar is ajar yea keep that shit open, potent
They can't measure up I'm too tall yo
Choke 'em, murder on the mic and now they all know
Frozen, spit it so cold that I cause snow
You gon' need a sweater and beanie like waldo
Mother fucker I am that dude
Who else could pull off these Super Mario tattoos
I got these other rappers salty like cashews
Cause I'm bad news, for my competition, that's true
Comin' through, my dude, I live limitless
Sick, achoo, I proved I spit vigorous
Hating on me while I bruise your chicks clitoris
She was into it and I was into her, get it bitch?
Kid Icarus, flying through the clouds
With a bottle full of liquor and a pocket full of loud
G-g-go across the country and I'm rockin' every crowd
I'm a dog, one hundred deeds of Eddie McDowd
And I'm a spit my damn flows, suburban commando
Call me Rambo, backpack on like Banjo
Kazooie, truly in charge like soprano
And Jacks at the head of the table of Samcro
My mind wanders while I'm writing a free-verse
And this weed only makes my A.D.D. worse
But I'm coming with the bars let the beast work
That's why your little sister got a Webby t-shirt
Rocking, dope hip-hopping
Full speed with it and I never plan on stopping
Italiano on the mic so yo he fucking mobbin'
All I do is murder beats I got a fucking problem
Porque todos te quieren probar (Ah; sí)
Lo que no saben es que no te dejas llevar de cualquiera
Y todos te quieren probar (Na')
Lo que no saben es que hoy yo te voy a buscar
(Me ah tell you; yeh, yeh)
Dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabe' que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías (Remember that)
Cuando yo te lo hacía (Okay!)
Yeh, dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabe' que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías (Girl, me ah tell you)
Cuando yo te lo hacía
Dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabe' que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías (Tú misma lo decía'; remember that)
Cuando yo te lo hacía (Cuando yo te lo hacía; okay)
Dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabe' que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías (Tú misma lo decía'; girl, me ah tell you)
Cuando yo te lo hacía (Cuando yo te lo hacía)
Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, oh yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart. Oh yeah
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart. Yeah, yeah
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart (Not my baby, yeah-ah)
Passionate from miles away
(Oh, oh)
Passive with the things you say
(Passive with the things you say, now)
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
(I can't blame you at all)
Yeah, red ribbon ducking feds til we pass out
Birdcage: duck the shine til they let him out
There’s more money now and we done flipped the draught
Hella choppers, clip pulled, nigga, junior out
G’d up, I took it from the G-code
Presidental suites, with this cash flow
Uptown gangsta, vet hustla
Third Ward general, Young Cash Money
Before I leave home, I kiss my babies - hope I return safely
Knowin’ the odds against me - these devils, they tryin to break me
I’m still loyal, my habits became lavish
Dreams of new endeavours, pub deals and owning masters
And my home boys, aid to my conditions
I made em all managers, execs and assistants
And most of don’t understand, some won’t listen
We might fall off, throw fits and get missing
But your still my dawg and my big homie support me
I feel cause I’m the youngest, he expects a little more from me
So I try to stay humble and if you can see my vision
You can see us Cash Money til the motherfucking ending, Brisco
Uh, YMCMB baby...
Before I leave home, kiss my girl on the cheek and then I say a prayer
If looks was bullets I woulda been there from stairs
I bypass the elevator and I took the stairs
Now that hard work got me ridin in Bentleys and Lears
Homie I am so prepared, on point like infrareds
I live my life so to die, I ain’t never scared
And when I drop, I’m not gon flop, I’m no Andre Way
I can’t see you haters, guess my vision is impared
My niggas already there, yes we’d got that title
You other rappers losing weight, minus the lipo
Breath of fresh air, pump lung, money catscan
So Cash Money heart bleed, Young Money, one hunny
(Twist… Young Money)
Before I leave home, well manner, nice, respectful young man
Momma taught me well, but daddy taught me through a jail cell
Raised as a prince, n Young Money then took me in
Made it official, YM young and CMB what's happenin'
Yeah, I gotta do it for my hood
See before I stepped off the block I told all them niggas I would
Let’s do it for the OC, I put in work on that TV
And step one over a G now put your hands for the lil old me
Jyea! Stay true to my team
YMCMB aka the greatest
Yea, that’s why they hate us
Went from layaway to rocking all the latest, fashion
Name a model chick I ain’t smashing
New cars for all my homies when I bring that cash in
Never had my father in my life, he was a dead beat
Moms worked two jobs and keep Jordans on my feet
Now that I’m on, they set the worry bout
I bought my momma a mansion, and moved the damn south - and watcha talking bout?
Got my Bugatti on the way Stunna
Money coming in fast like the road walk, back
Whistle for my family, my label and my set
It’s Young Money til my day the death, tell the rest take a rest
Thoroughbreded and blessed, my grime stressed
Sometimes get never the less, young n shining with the best
I promised my mama one day I’ll be a rhymer, she left
But I love her so much it’s like she never took a step
Reality showed me them colors that some of us couldn't
Look at you now that we all thought some of us wouldn't
He said he gettin dough right, ready jetty for pole lights
Petty better than to roll dice, some cold nights, they getting us no life, but I’m here now
And we here like, something, nothing compare life
CMB, I’m privilaged in this legacy that’s real life
My brothers keep up, protect me from my friends Lord
My enemies’ll bleed ya, choking on anaestesia
Throw my signs high, recognize world wide, world wide
I’m in it to get whatever it cost me, it’s too noisey
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
Sing it, sing it
In the air
I know you care
Smack it, smack it
Smack it, smack it
In the air
Smack it, smack it, in the air
Wave your hands side to side, put it in the air
Clap, clap, clap like you don't care
Smack that, clap, clap, clap, like you don't care

Clap it, clap it, clap it, clap it

Ooh wee Bey be freaky deaky, think me see she pink bikini
Rock that groovy dye dashiki, Nefertiti, edges kinky
Sweatin' out my blow out, sweatin' out my press
This trick about to go off, mad 'cause I'm so fresh
Fresher than you, fresher than you
Fresher than you, oh
I take time to make that (Money)
Some breakdowns get caked back (Money)
Flip eight times, get eight stacks (Money)
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's no need to stash right (Money)
Same four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me
Hey yo I'm movin' on up, excuse a moi, pardon it's me
There's a new chapter to life that I'm starting to see
And I'ma make and spend money to the hardest degree
And on the low I probably mimic every artist I see
I need a house, a wifey, a nice watch and a lot of cake
I can't lie, there's certain figures I gotta make
And for my family, this a shot that I gotta take
Cause where I live there's nobody as hot as Drake
Which basically means, who's faith in his team
Will resort to new cars, briefcases with cream
Tryna find a space in the jeans for placing the green
And a watch get they attention, the bracelet's clean
I'm stayin' the music, wifey kinda need to be a band lover
I keep it flow, an old school like your grandmother
I'm a tan brother, they use rubber bands to keep his money intact, if you don't like it you should ban rubber
I take time to make that (Money)
Some breakdowns get caked back (Money)
Flip eight times, get eight stacks (Money)
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's no need to stash right (Money)
Same four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me
These days I really can't break 20s, hunnid and make money, money
Every month, the government will take money from me
Make 750, look how quicky I spent that, don't call me broke cause I strictly resent that
Last my P had to flip my the rent, because the tax bracket I'm in's is 50 percent flat
All because of Ebay givin' me leway, basically do the PayPal, I need a raise now
Seems every time a nigga stop and he eat, I end up always tryna shop and compete
They know a nigga 'bout it when it's in his size and cops it in more colors than Popsicle Pete
Till I'm piled to the top with receipts, trust the store and I don't understand less is more
Wanna get 'em to the point where they owe me, and they gon' see Drake's on his JOB, it's like...
I take time to make that (Money)
Some breakdowns get caked back (Money)
Flip eight times, get eight stacks (Money)
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right
There's no need to stash right
Same four G's from last night
You cannot take that from me
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand em
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still…
Clean in this bitch I'm feelin' myself goddamn a nigga rich
And every time I touch it guaranteed to be hit
And when them checks come guaranteed to be a split
I'm flyer then an invitation
Like I'm the information
Toronto's been waiting and I'm glad ya'll been waiting patient
But I'm here now these niggas is old news
I mix cocaine powder with the pro tools
(Whip it) Yeah crack that's just how I double back
Europeako jeans bleeding on them white air max
And these niggas keep asking me when you gon' drop
Why the fuck you keep harassing me when's that gon' stop
I guess its when my albums selling in the stores
And they sayin' damn I use to know the boy
Now I barely see em
And the little kids wanna be him
He a star now look up you'll probably see him
Hook
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand em
Nigga I'm Still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still…
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't, ayy (Yuh)
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, (Don't)
I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
Might go down a G.O.D. (Ayo), yeah, ayy
I go hard on Southside G, yuh, wait
I make sure that north-side eat, yuh, nah
And still, bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Ayy, ayy, yeah
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Ayy, yuh, nah
She say, "Do you love me?"
I tell her, "Only partly, I only love my bed and my mama, I'm sorry"
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me (Yeah)
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
'Magine if I never met the broskies (Yeah)
God's plan, God's plan (Word)
I can't do this on my own, ayy, nah
Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, ayy
I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, nah
Might go down as G.O.D. (Ayo), yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, yuh, wait
I make sure that north-side eat, yuh, nah
And still, bad things
There's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yeah, yeah
Ayy, ayy, yuh, nah
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yeah
Ayy, yuh, nah
K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
Never been a people person, always been a people's person
Know how to get a person, don't know how to keep a person, yeah
But you know everybody need somebody
And everybody ain't gon' be somebody
I mean, it's been like twenty years since my mother has seen somebody
I'm convinced that she thinks that's it's too late or somethin'
I should try and set her up on a date or somethin'
You deserve love, how long are you gon' wait for somethin'?
Nah, we gon find you someone doin' some
Someone rich and single, is Lionel Richie single?
Haha, okay, I'm jokin', I'm kiddin', I'm playin'
At least tell me that you hear all this shit that I'm sayin'
I don't wanna be the only man you laugh with
Life is quick, you should start it happy and end it happy
She ask me "Are you and... happy?"
I never told you what ended up happenin'
I started believin' that crazy shit she told me
Not sure if that makes me crazy or just lonely
Then I got bored, because fightin' is boring
And she was gone soon as I started stallin'
I don't want it except for when I want it
And even then I beat myself up for it
That's when you hear me say I'm movin' on from it
But it's obviously something else that I want from it
And then that's how she goes about it
It's hard to act like you want it when you know you got it
I'm textin' and callin' like that's my true callin'
And the only time that she's really talking
Is when you she tells me about myself like that's what's important
Startin' things over nothin', that shit is overwhelmin'
Her main problem is she always think I'm up to somethin'
And, shit, talking 'bout it make me wanna fuckin' call her
Reverse psychology, whatever you call it
But to answer the question, yeah, I think we're happy
We're always reunited, that's a good thing, I guess
We're always startin' over, that shit always seems excitin'
I don't know, I guess it's yet to be seen
She's busy doin' her and I'm out here chasin' the dream
Honestly, we say a lot of things that we don't mean
Start happy, end happy, with the summer in between, slow motion
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me: Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
Everybody gotta deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
...the offer you give me was preposterous
Papi, this bird won't fly, you sold me an ostrich
I'm just another nigga tryna keep his money up
I'll wipe that smirk off your face, you think it's funny, huh?
I ain't playin' my nigga, go ahead and giggle
But bullets don't tickle
If you think you playin' with Elmo, hell no
Ladies and Gentlemen
We are now broadcastin live from London England
Back then it was me plus you, we us two did every single thing that we must do
You trust me, me trust you, plus there's no one else that I see just you
Now a days I'm riding on the bandwagon driver of a porche caiyan wagon
Ice in the necklace light skinned and hectic and all these simple things got a man braggin
And boastin a little never drank much in the past but now they got the kid toastin a little
So cheers to the fact you here in the track you shoulda been shotgun his career in the back
And his two month lease expires right now knew I shoulda got me a truck with two front seats I assume it's
Done I'm lookin at my passenger side I realize that there's room for one oh
Now a days you be all cried out no more tears no more planes cause you all flyed out
Need the lord in your life on a Sunday no more fashion nomore spendin your life on the runway
Deal with it you hardly can all this hype around Drake whatever happened to Aubrey Graham
Well it's her he’s needin you gotta say leave in the word but I know leavin has crossed your mind
You jealous of some autographs I often sign I try to make it to dinner never often time
But I often find myself hearin your voice you said you never felt a touch soft as mine
I was sayin how the range and the loft is mine had to change in the planes and the porche is mine
It's a deal I was forced to sign but I never imagined that youd end up fourth in line no
Look this for that girl that you use to see for anybody that want it how it use
To be all the love afection and all the cash I wanna rewind but we movin forward fast
And I adore all the pictures that everyone in the media is dyin for
Back when there was one camera to smile for
There was only couple things I could buy you compared to now where I'm kinda like heres a thou
Drop grands through appear in style but I could still be chillin in sweat pants and a stainless ring
Without you I havnt gained a thing oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, oh, gone on them)
She tryna take it all off for me (Tryna take it all off)
Tryna stay real close to me (She tryna stay real close)
I gotta catch myself (I gotta catch myself)
I can't play myself, I need to take it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Railiza (Ow!), you need a... money and visa
And you get what you want, always from me
I can't say "No" when you say "Please," I can't say "No"
Howisha, you need a... (Ow!) baby with me, uh
And I'm takin' my time, just wait, don't leave
I can't say "No" when you say "Please," I can't say "No" (Ow!)
You wanna drink like Bajan and dance like Trini, yeah
You want a supermodel pose like mi real friend Winnie (Like mi real friend)
Yeah, vacation is done, but I'm not finished, no
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning (Pardon!)
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, gone on them, gone on them) (Ow!)
She tryna take it all off for me (Close) (Tryna take it all off)
Tryna stay real close to me (She tryna stay real close)
I gotta catch myself (I gotta catch myself)
I can't play myself, I need to take it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Uh-uh, yeah
Uh
I wanna be together, when they say that they know somebody better
I just hope you stay down, uh
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay—
And girl, I know you got your spies, when they happen to catch me in a lie
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down
I just hope you stay—
Look, I'm sorry that I'm super late
I was drivin' here jammin' them Lil Boosie tapes
Understand that I do not envision, I hallucinate
I'm the type of nigga you could never ever duplicate, but
Let's talk about the babies me and you could make
We could do it anywhere, baby, you just choose the place
I hope I'm not being inappropriate
But maybe if I peak under the table, you could show me it?
Let me get a quickie, speed stick, no deodorant
To cover up the smell 'cause your parents are the nosiest
When you famous all the bitches wanna throw you it
But even with a bunch of women, you could be the loneliest
I tend to ask more than I can give
Or wait whatever's next and just get bored of what it is
That's probably why I'm keepin' you around
Was looking for exactly what I found
I just hope you stay down
Know more, ask less
All verses get dummied like crash tests
I say your favorite rappers subpar at best
These whack niggas couldn't find me with an address
Yes, guess who's back at it
Stage an intervention, it's apparent I'm an addict
Balling isn't my hobby it's more like a habit
These niggas acting like every day is the Sabbath
My life move faster then a leopard sprint
Round the world got a lot of spots like leopard print
And I'm fresh like peppermint
Always claim Toronto most of them are scared to represent
Cause success we've never had it
Many came close but never managed to grab it
It must be an omen
The curse so tragic
Til they give me a Grammy
Then poof, black magic
If this don't sell, Imma make it sell
And criticism's invited, I take it well
My savings account got a vacant smell
And priorities shift when you take a L
Every time I feel like leaving
Somebody'll play Comeback Season
And that'll give me enough of a reason
To stand outside trying to jingle my keys and
I guess I'm attached to her
Can't fathom going back to a bachelor
When you've been in a Range since you started high school
It’s hard going back to the Acura
Yeah, yeah
So Imma stick around as the rain trickle down and the cars get sold
These rappers is all thickle but a ways it could sound
Full of loud and go and put her face to the town
You better cuff yo chick
When you see us out nigga
You better cuff yo chick
You better keep her close to ya
You better cuff yo chick
You better grab her tight cuz you know we got millions for real
No it ain't drizzy, its ya boy em dolla
No I ain't rich, but cuff yo chick by the collar
Cuz if a little nigga like me tryna holla
Then I gaurentee ya'll breakin up tomorrow
I know she your everything, I just feed her protine
Beat it in the bed sheets, and put her in a deep sleep
And when she wake up she always askin for a repeat
I know she rep the "A" but I put her on my B-team
I ain't gonna sell a dream, but the last girl I sold D
I had her relapsin like a fiene
Nino Brown type, what she want in her life
Is a nigga like me layin pipe, you better cuff yo chick
Damn V-O, sounds like you got a lot of niggas mad at you bruh. Guess that's what happens when uh, you a R&B Diva tryna live a rapper's life. You know what I'm saying. But um, if you really want it with me man I got you, I'mma show you what it is to get exposed, I hope I'm on key, hahaha
The V-O-Y I'm talking to you
And both them record deals that ain't never go through
OK Voyce, we know you was a snitch
But you don't get your boys back like that
Still need a ride, you ain't gettin paid
And Taj got you at them shoots wearing pink shades
OK Voyce, always knew you a bitch
But I ain't know you got down like that
I hear you issuing threats, you need to kill the jive talk
Furthest thing from street bruh, that's why I call you sidewalk
We here waiting, if you stupid then try it
How you gon' knock me out lookin' like Snoop on a diet?
Uh, listen slim fast, we all know that
The only time that you raisin' up the shooters is in the gym class
This ain't dooms day, this today and after
This a diss track from your sister's favorite rapper
Ho, I hope this ego trip you on won't last honey
Cause everyone you get around got you gas money
And where the cash at? Nigga speakin' of gas money
We all had to give you lifts, isn't that funny?
It's real talk, you know better I don't play that
He tell you I'mma liar, I figured that he would say that
But this the same nigga that be talkin' about a Maybach
And can't make a move from his momma house in Ajax

Uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind
Flash, black lingerie white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass, you say you want it fast
Define fast, cause I can speed it up, and make it last
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure you never forget it, commited, im ready, im with it
Still here like a statue, pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got bagges, well im packed too, plus I got a sex pistol
Pointed right at you "BANG!", the baddest women ever in the heart of south
Proven over and over again thats why im hard to doubt, plus im
Young money 'till the death, I took the carter route
Im more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about
Artist: Drake
Pay attention, its on
Staring at my city lights through the plane window as I write this song
Have faith, when I do it
I’ma do it bigger than they think
I dont just flow I over flow I be filling up the sink
Like I left the water on I run this bitch if anybody ask
Ain't much change since high school
Niggas still be in and out of class
S class or the brand new CL5 on them haters
Black paint, chrome trim same color as the logo for the raiders
I just said that cause I'm out in California in the studio with Tez
You should give us credit niggas killin people we can be all doin that instead..
But we not, we just kill the summer every single time I come around
Never chase hoes but we do we laugh at them niggas tryin to run em down
Not I, not me, YMOB, call jaz, call c
Bet both of them would agree
Get viewed, get judged, get booed, get loved
Shit get done round here, do you, not us
Im gon do what I want
Cause this life’s made for living
You got to know nothings for sure
Faith in the stars
Im gon do what I want
Cause this life’s what I’m given
Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds
Once upon a time I met
On this cold explosive dosage she wrote this
But tell me who chose this
Sin city’s innocent really when its inside my mind
And co-sign with a rhyme and a big pen
Once again it’s an even odd
Can’t applaud with one hand
Can’t be God with one fan
Or can you stan you
If not pastor jackson daniels rip that hit that
Now I sip that lightly when I’m on my mic tightly
And I write nightly like Spike Lee
Let me break it down
I been having a maid since the 8th grade with a fade
Rapping by the swings
And the bell never really rings
Class in session there’s no recession
For this upper echelon mic testing its
K-dash-O-S F-R-E-S-H in the place
With a grace in and outta space
Mind that gotta race
Don’t be something that you really not
Sabotage the universal plot
When the planet earth rock gets hot
From the sun don’t get got just get God yeah see that
(Do you believe)
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money
Dolla dolla bill y'all
I stack for the future you thinkin’ temporary
I talk about jewels you thinkin’ February
Send who you want and nigga you know I’m ready
Niggas hatin’ they can’t stand the fact I’m getting fetty
Niggas waiting for me to fall and i know this plenty
So i sit back and i relax and i just sip this Henny
And stack my cheese and watch these rats cause they stomachs is empty
Young niggas gettin’ slain all over some skrill
Goes to show you’ll do anything for a dollar bill
Dig a grave get a gun
And a plot to kill
Shit i donno what to say
It costs to be the boss but it pays to weigh
That’s not really you that’s just who you portray
I want money
You want the fame and radio play
Hoppin' out that thing and they makin that radio face
Fat nigga kick back lots of food on my plate
I traded in the pork and beans for a piece of the steak
I ain't tryna look back ain't no foot on the brakes
I think my phone’s wire tapped listen in for the jakes
Fat nigga I’m raising the heat
So the sun is ma son my thinking is deep
You reap what you sow and you sow what you reek
I remember growing up I had holes in my sneaks
Mama sent me two socks it was cold on my feet
Pops barely knew him only see him in pictures
Mom’s a pastor I grew up knowin the scripture
With a ripped shirt on the strip til the nigga got strip searched
The world is mine
I think my name should be Atlas
Makin hits like I leave on the clay for the crouches
My traps pumping your traps as dry as a cactus
I wanna cheat on my girl with a actress
Im tired of hidin that dope under my mattress
Kill it i did it for practice
I say fuck chasing bitches imma chase my dream
Cash rules everything im loving my CREAM
Money is the object should i get it any means
Got a circle full of soldiers man
Im loving my team
It was all a dream
None like biggy tho
Smoked out my mind but im steady blowin fifties tho
Always on point like I’m standing on my tippy toes
Loyalty is a must but some niggas never get it tho
And that’s the rule that imma live by
Watching for the snakes some niggas be tryna get by
Party hard and you roll blunts and tryna get high
They copy all your swag and fit it in to make em look fly
I really wanna know why
The question still remains
Did I ever spend the money that I managed to have saved
All these bitches wanna fuck me they see money in my veins
And this pressure on my shoulder got me feelin goin insane
But I’m good
I be out grindin while you niggas sleep
I remember days when I was grindin and I ain't never sleep
Posted on the block while I be up and down the fuckin streets
Gotta lot of issues now I'm tearin on the fuckin beat
Lamborghini sit back feelin merciealgo
Table full of models and bottles surround the cop doe
Shawty dancing im throwing hundreds she screaming tato
It's a party a celebration wherever i go
My niggas riding with me
Drunk or tipsy
Bad bitch beside me she's just rolling up a spliffy
Hop up in the whip, hit the clutch, doin sixty
Black interior, black body, Im moving swiftly
Yeah, yeah, uh
I'm feelin' you, guaranteed that you into me
I got the phantom, the aston, the bent-e-ley
But let me tell you where a nigga at mentally
Two things I don't give a bitch: pay checks and sympathy
Ha! But I guess it's just the pimp in me
All around paid, can't even get a sentence free
So judge a nigga sweetheart, sentence me
I ain't worried it's gon' happen if it's meant to be
And if you ever feel the need to step inside
Be a woman about it and know we living separate lives
Trying to tell you, less feelings mean less goodbyes
That's some game for your ass, better recognize
But some cats can't even relate
I ain't a mind reader though, so if you tryna escape
Then let me know that, show that
My place, roll back, lay down, so flat
Tell Me!
Lyrics from Snippet 2
... Talkin' and a lil chit-chat
You rollin' with me, then we fucking when we get back
Don't decline, just recline, sit back
Me in the zone, gon' on patron
In a club, in a club, playin her song
That's when I slowly approach
She like daddy what you know
Told the girl (on my drink)
Then she drop it down low
To the floor, to the floor
She took it to the floor
(repeat 3x)
Ok, Ok, Sittin' in a owners box
And in the Caribbean twistin' off Corona tops
I'm sittin' down hittin' half court floater shot
Bitches takin' pictures because every night's a photo op
Yeah, and nothing has been photo shopped
I say I'mma buy the bar and they say nigga no you're not
I be satisfied with the percentage that my lawyer got
Makin' other people rich is something I enjoy alot
Uh, can you tell even when your girl won't
I'mma still be feelin' me even when the world don't
Shit just changed forever first I get a lot of dough
Then I end up with your woman that's just how it's gotta go
Yeah, and I can tell her things and treat her right
You can get whatever baby remember you and me tonight
Throw the pussy at me guarantee that you won't see a strike
I'mma hit it hard you gon' think you Derek Jeter wife
Uh, tell me, how does that sound?
I can get it ass up and with your back down
Spit that all suki suki in your ear
It's the nigga Rich Boy and the rookie of the year
You see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom. After this, I don't have a choice. I got people to provide for, promises I've made, and goals to meet. Hmm. What you got?Comeback
Yo, fuck you Pete, you made a fool outta me
I used to trust you dog, now you embarrassing me
And you skinny as hell, and you make me mad
You think you funny, huh? Well you ain't Josh Gad
And your tattoos suck, you're the guy no one likes
We used to be best friends, now we foes for life
Damn
Oh, you icing me bitch? What did I do to you?
You used to be my best friend, now I'll never trust you
Is it the stuff that I said? 'Cause if not, then that's wack
Most people I know, they would've said "Hi" back
Damn
Actually, I was you bitch, it was for my hat
But you took it from me, now we never going back
I could never trust you, 'cause you were rude to my hat
If Josh Gad was here, he would've made me laugh
Damn
I said I wasn't done you little fucking ice cream
I had like 10 sips left, you just so damn mean
Now I got no friends, and I got no water
And I lost my hat
Damn
"Good job," that's it? I'm doing great, you bitch
Say that again to my face, nigga.
Suck my dick!
Yeah, yeah
Uh
High Rollers, what's up?
Dreams Houston, what's up?
Onyx, what's up?
You does it, baby, you does it, baby
Harlem Knights, what's up?
Treasures, what's up?
Legends, what's up?
Just love me, baby, just love me, baby
Yeah (Yeah)
To all my Houston, Texas country muffins
Baby, let me hit that liquor and that blunt you puffin'
And after that, I'ma throw that fucking young money up and we can both watch it fall like it's bungee jumping
Man, I'm so high
Next time we won't smoke all of the ounce you buy (Ooh)
I almost forgot to blow the candles out 'cause I don't really wanna fall asleep and light this house on fire
Goodnight, I'm still up, I told my girl to lay down
I see the bottle is full, I'm 'bout to drink it way down
What up, Bun, my nigga? Man, you know we stay down
And I'm a honorary resident in UGK town
I'm on my way
Yeah, I'm on my way
I never give a fuck about what any nigga say
The music all slow and the bitches all pretty
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city in this thang
What up? What up?
H-Town in this bitch
What up? What up?
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city
What up? What up?
What up? What up?
What up? What up?
H-Town in this bitch
What up? What up?
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city
What up? What up?
What up? What up?
What up? What up?
H-Town in this bitch
What up? What up?
H-Town in this bitch
What up? What up?
H-Town in this bitch
What up? What up?
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city
Yeah
I can't have the tissue before you sneeze, you know (No)
I can't bow down at your feet, you know (No)
Mmm
(No, no)
Yeah, Drizzy
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote "Take Care" but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything's a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all close
I'm just more ready than—
Yeah, yeah
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Yeah
You don't wanna question it, you just want definite, yeah
I jump out of relationships before I get left in it, yeah
The sex we have reminds me of the money and success a bit, yeah
'Cause even when I got it, I just gotta keep getting it
Even when I got it, I just gotta keep getting it
Big hotel suite, I'm the only one in it
Always going back to some shit that I already been it
Plenty fish up in the sea but I never go fishing
We got everybody sick, sending "get well soons" and a lot of well wishes
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all close
I'm just more ready than—
Yeah, I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
I gotta keep you rigth here 'cause I don't like sharing
We've been gettin' wild like Olivia, never had a souvenir carring
Told 'em I was ready back when they are just not hearing
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than...
Yeah, yeah
Ayy
It was meant to happen, the most trusted going triple platinum
Link with Mac, link with Fe, if I'm down in Baton
Link with Tez, link with C, when I'm down in Jackson
Just got back, overseas I was the main attraction
This ain't them, this is me, so you know what's crackin'
I mean there's not even a doubt, you know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, "I got to make it out"
And I did, I did, I really did
Switch up the sentiment, rappin' on instruments
Just hung up the phone and I
Could already tell that you're comin' home intoxicated, ooh
So you better take your time with me
'Cause I remember last time you wouldn't make love to me
Think you fell fast asleep (I hope you niggas sleep)
Wouldn't even talk to me now
Say, say I'm so crazy, baby
I wanted you to erase my mind
I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to erase my mind
Yeah, alright
Look, like my big bro say I'm goin' in
Olympic pools of money I’m just glad I learned to swim
Cannonball, bitch, I hope the divin' board's sturdy
And I hope when dinner's cold my niggas do not desert me
Ha, and these haters like damn 'em
I gave a lot of women they first ride in the Phantom
And yeah I got a deal now and I'm secure with it
And yet my life is so excitin' I get bored with it
I'm the best one outta my peers
And everybody pray I'm runnin' outta ideas
Pass my Moselys it's all so bright
And I'm the result of when it all goes right
So many pictures man the flow is a collage
Critics have a hard time pointin' out the flaws
All this slick talk, I just hope I don't fall
Right out of the sky through the roof of your garage
I'm a...
Part of me wished I can meet with
All you haters in person, they got a lot of
Feelings for me they just ain't certain. How to
Express themselves when I walk into the club and
Take stares like the fuckin elevators ain workin
Yeah. Cause they know the promoter pays you, you wouldn't
Have come if somebody hadn't of made you, you just looking
Forward to seeing women that played you and shitting
On the men they get engaged to, I swear it's like. Uh
More confidence and less fear. We can discuss it further
When y'all manage to get here. Diddy here, O here
Skinny here, Rex here and we just having one of them conversations
About next year. I`ma kill it, I promise that`s how I know you
Mad. I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads. The
Big homie use a flash if you must and I swear I ain't asking
For much, all I want is the
T. Slack, I promise I got 'em, homie!
I turn the phone off, I let the seat back
I'mma be out for a minute, I'll bring the heat back
The jet-setta and forever will I get chedda
And y'all will only get cash when you get betta
Check luggage, flow to a new city
Plus, the hoodie cover my eyes
I'm too pretty, nah, I'm just playin'
Heavy is how I weigh in
Top floor with a view of the water is what I stay in
But y'all don't hear me, yeah, y'all ain't relatin'
Well, let me tell you what happens when I be datin'
These chicks with ass fully skip they class
Catch me at the hotel and try and get they cash
But, I'm not stupid, nah -- I'm tight fisted
You tryna sex me for money is quite twisted
Prior to fall, I was lying to y'all
So if you gettin' one ring, I'm denyin' ya call
Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doing his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feeling where he's at let him know
He just doing his thing
Gotta love that
Now my momma kinda iffy, My uncle kinda shifty
Expenses at this point have cost a little over fifty
The hummer and the range was in someone else's name
Hope my city's reputation for the summer's gonna change
I hope you stick around and see it
Cause if you ain't around I'll bring your chick around to see it
Until she catch feelings and I have to let her go
And when I park my car outside she'll stick around and key it
Repercussions of a cheap lash
Had me doing repaints, just to get em re-scratched
And get attached do insane things
Take new jewelry and put it down the drain things
But, that's just the drama that the fame brings
Fresh prince tryna touch sky like
Mr. Busy, Mr. Recieve the shipment
It's Mr. big dreams, no more than 2 months commitment
Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doin his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feelin where he's at let him know
He just doin his thing
Gotta love that
Are you familiar with this feeling
No concealing
Its out all out in the open
The type of life you first timers could soak in
That virgin pussy's waiting
And Im about to poke it
Im underrated, I am Ricky Henderson to Oakland
But im about to sleep em, Acquire em', and keep em'
I require a retainer to retire them and sweep em' in a Dust pan
New guy, Too fly, who buy seven cars
Dubai seven stars
You die heaven's our's
And you don't see the jag drop in here
Its like im chasing my dad the way I tag pops in in here
Lets see how many carrots we can do
Mixin' farm land green with that paratrooper blue
Who are you? You confused homie, that's a pensive look there
Where those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear
Thats a 07 but I got a even newer ride
Doors all suicide
I should be your tour guide
Im expedia flown
Wikepidia known
Obtain a key to your home
And take a seat on your throne
I been through it all
Spend it all to do it all
You are not me man I could never be you at all
Cause you just stupid dog
The A8 super large
And yea you got a range but that shit ain't even supercharged
Aight check, flow switch, Flow switch
I don't ever pay a percentage of the retail
Only thing Im paying is attention to the detail
Schedule can change at the mention of a email
Booking up a show with some tension with a female
My Dad said to get rich you have to dig deep
Cause Drake these some big streets
And you are not Big Meech
And you are not Rayful
And this is not DC
Four years later quarter million off of TV
You was having hoop dreams
I was drafting group schemes
Take us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams
Well woop there it is
Oops now my troops clean
First car Audi drop, Color like a poutine
Im feelin grown up, Don't ask me for id, like you know who I be, bouncer I know the owner
I never go, I felt out of place at a school dance
Cause they know the layout of the mall like I knew france
Inside and out, Therefore I been Hiding out
And you drive cars that I been riding out
Correction I been rode em out
Been showin' out, sold off shit the stories you've been told about
And dog, I been old amount
Young money old accounts
Degrassi my royalties
Homie you just owed an once
No weight move
My shoulder counts
Man, I don't even know my name anymore man (laughs)
I’m not that good with words, but I’m a try my best
Look, I don’t wanna ever make you mad girl
I just wanna have you see you know the things young men are hesitant to have girl
A little you a little me and someone else, good lord that’s a winner right there
But we really got a story to tell, it can’t finish right there
I used to wonder what my old girl doing right now
Ever since you came into my life
Everytime I think it’d be good to call her
I just think about you and it’d make me think twice, ah yeah
Yeah, I know we’ve been through a couple things
You know a couple things, what are we to do
But you make me feel good, cause you love me for me and you love me for you
Come on

Uh, tryin' not to over think
Only 'cause I drove and I've done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon' do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure
Listen, seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Listen, harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even
So don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no
I can't blame you, no, oh oh oh oh
I can't blame you, no, oh oh oh oh
It's uhm, it's great to be back on SNL
Where's Toronto at? Is Toronto in the house tonight? Yeah
So...as you can tell I'm from Canada
And I know what you're thinking, but... no
You can not move in with me if Trump wins
I'm sorry, that's no go
I really am glad to be here but you'll ha...you'll have to excuse me if I seem a little upset
Backstage, right before I came out
My friend showed me this...meme he found online
And it just...it really shook me
It was a picture of me dancing in my Hotline Bling video
And some joker...had put a caption on it that said
"When you farted and got away with it"
And if I'm being real, like...it hurts, you know...and it...
It just seems like this keeps happening to me
And I don't know...It's almost like I can do is sing about it
So...I'm ready
Drinks with some old friends
That's when it happens again
I start hearing from the whole fam
That I got clowned on Instagram
Tryna hide my reaction
When I read the funny caption
Feels like I'm in a bad dream
Cause I got turned into another meme, yeah
I just wanna scream
That I'm more than a meme, that's right
I just wanna scream
That I'm more than a meme
Catch me looking with those bedroom eyes
Asking if you're gonna finish those fries
Tryna say you really care about me
But then you put my picture on E.T (It's not nice)
How can I explain to my momma
When you got my beard on Obama
I do not complain, I am not a whiner
But why am I sitting on the Seinfeld diner?
I feel like I'm swimming upstream
Against all of these memes
Why do they attack me?
And then attack my favorite team?
Look, I'm not just a picture, I have feelings too
Like, how would you feel if it happened to you?
If I came after you, did a meme of her
Yeah cause your sketch got cut after dress rehearsal (eighty)
What if I found your moment of pain
And used it for my own comedy gain?
Now you know what I mean
That I'm more than a meme
And look, I get that my face is expressive
But some of the memes are a little aggressive
I would just say it's a little excessive
When you go make me the face of Progressive
I know it's not important
But when they catch my face contorted
And the meaning gets distorted
I can only help but feel like crying Jordan
I'm more than a meme
Oh, ladies and gentleman, do I have a treat for you tonight
Rihanna is here tonight, make some noise
Oh I'm so excited to be here tonight
Oh my God, oh my God
Yeah, see Drake ain't a meme, meme, meme, meme, meme
But it nah seem, seem, seem, seem, seem, seem
Another joker getting, getting, getting, getting, getting
I swear we only friend, friend, friend, friend, friends...
Alright, Rihanna's incredible ladies and gentleman
Make some noise for her please
I should take it as a sign of self-esteem
It feels like I'm the victim of an internet scheme
It's just hard when it seems
You don't love me for me
You just love me for memes
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't "son" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Yeah
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
I know they wanna take my place
They can tell that love is fake
And I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Straight up to my face, tryna play it safe
Vibe switch like night and day
I can see it, like, right away
I came up, you changed up
I caught that whole play
Things never been the same
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
I know they wanna take my place
They can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Skrrt!
Uh, shit's all good
The deal got signed, and my split's all good
And these haters pretending that it's all good
Say that shit in person man, I wish y'all would
I'm a motherfuckin' genius, goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed, then the slightest could have fooled me
Yeah, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname's "Starter Drake"
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen, I could draw attention
But you could tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie (Drake)
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie

I meant every word that I said
You should have spent more time listening
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a, "Hold on"
What makes you so ready right now?
After I waited on you for so long
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?

Why you want to, why you want to?
Why you want to, why you want to?

I pictured this going differently
Even when you sleep in my bed
I know you're not mine officially
And all the things I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a, "Hold on"
What makes you so ready right now?
After I waited on you for so long
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?

Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?
Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love?

Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the you been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a read-along
Ain't a sing-a sing-along 'less you brought the along
Then ju… okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a no don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then for my head get to
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long ain't ain't for the long talkin'; I'm beast
Uh, It's 10 O'Clock on a Wednesday and I know your home (Know your home)
Driving up and down your street hoping you that come outside (Come outside)
Cause I just got paid and I'm winning bout to call you on it (Call you on it)
And I just need you to see me, oh, oh (Oh, oh)
Charlie says it seems that will make it all better (Better)
Selfish says it is, this just ain’t bout you, no (bout you, no)
Did me wrong every time we were together, gether
So that’s why, I’m gonna stunt on you
I’m gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could have made it all on my own
All they do is PR double-E me like I'm Dolph
They say "holy" when they see the chain, that's not a cross
Put the owl on it, you can never take it off
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted

You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you

I ain't been here in a minute)
Cut the lights off I feel fantastic right now baby...
Yeah... Look...
I said I used to cut the porch lights on and now I cut the porches lights on just to let them know their foresight's wrong
Where this rapper going with that obscure ice on he a lame I'm just tryna get my mature life on
O.D., O.D. Everybody know me, even fans that resemble them kids in the O.C
Oh me Oh my them girls love me like Seth Cohen
So get a grip get a glass pour the XO in
I did want one these niggas to say that I'm not the same
Pick a road cause where you driving is not a lane
And rest in peace to Pimp C life is not a game
Taking over the world no Pinky just a lot of Brain
He bout to send them the shit that I'm on (Yeah)
You probably could have predicted I'm on (Yeah)
My sense of judgment's a officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the swisher is blown
Ahh... I'm grown, I'm grown, I'm living in this elevator zone alone
I'm up so high, I'm never coming down and you say you got them hoes but they never coming 'round
I got penthouse bars I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all, my balcony is glass
And wifey's over (Bitches)
But money's over (Her)
Cause money's under (Nothing)
My life is such a (Blur)
That's not the way it has to go that's just what I prefer
And do not disagree with me it's best you just concur
I'm a legend with a legacy that can't help but survive
Even when I fucking die they're going to bury me alive...
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm living good gripping wood with all the features
Jesus my money straight no creases
Peep this
We got bottles over here

I’m way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we’re back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

You finally start to care
I show up so unprepared
You're ready for something new
I'm still where I was last year
I'm tired of talkin' it out
I just left my clothes at you're house
Seems like you're wantin' to stay
And I got a life now
Back where I stay (back where I stay)
Still pay a car note for this girl around my way (around my way)
Yeah 11x
Uh
Uh
It's 10 o'clock on a Wednesday and I know you're home
Driving up and down our street hoping that you'd come outside
Cause' I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me oohhhh
Childish as it seems it will make it all better, better
Selfish as it is this ain't' just about you noooooo
Did me wrong every time we were together, gether
And that's why
I'm gunna stunt, on, you
I'm gunna stunt, on, you
You let me go
Little did you know
I could've made it all on my own
I'm gunna stunt, on, you
I'm gunna stunt, on, you
You let me go
Little did you know
I could've made it all on my own
Thought I’d never see the light of day
You can thank me later for the record
I don’t even need it right away
I just really need the right of way
So that I can lane switch
Trust anybody that I came with
They will be here when I ain't rich
I-I-I swear, I know, they are in the boat I row
E’rrybody in it gotta paddle, muthaf-cker won’t let go
I done made a hundred thousand dollars every season I was on that show
I’ve been told I was next by a legendary that was on Death Row
It’s a secret, I’ma tell ‘em, rappers only claiming they get paid
I’ve been gettin love in the club ever since a nigga came in underage
I just put Patron in the pineapple and I do the same with lemonade
Let my money flow through the air, I can make it rain on your parade
I can do it, I can do it and I know the rumours get around
I’ma take my city to the top and then I’ma never let ‘em down
I’ma show a lot of people love, I’ma give ‘em credit where it’s due
Anyone that got it I can do it, this the one I dedicate to you
Cardiac arrest rap tag
Wait a sec, wait a minute, I’ve been in it from beginning
Spinnin’ raps like my heart was a tape deck, yes
I’ve been on the block, freestyling, wylin’ while I was a yout’
Many wonder what the truth it, when the future’s like a tattoo
Gotta make haste while the sun shines
If you only live one time when the spaceships arrive from the skies
I’ll be flyin’, I’m not lyin’ I’m sublime in my alpah state
Let the heart palpitate
Let the soul just astroplane
Here’s a secret, let me tell ‘em
We’re the ones that started rock n roll
Jimi Hendrix, Little Richard, platform shoes and an afro comb
Me ET phone home, BET play my song
Had faith oh so long, thats why we both flowed on so
Ohhhhh, I’m like another message they sent on the bottle
Now people knooooooow…
’bout a freak of nature with a pen and paper
Can’t escape in the ether if you got faith, yeah
See that
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure

You're now fucking with the most requested
The young nigga that everybody is so obsessed with
And black on black 62 float majestic
Me and Stunna in it, boy I'm just so connected
Caught up in a popularity contest
It's about to reach my dreams and I ain't even got my arms stretched
Thank Me Later first week I'm taking all bets
Because a million copies isn't really far fetched
I keep credit cards in cash knots
I keep my darkest shades on until the flash stops
It's for my LA girls getting them implants
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots
Got em for a reason shawty, go ahead buss it open
I keep a secret baby, nothing's heard when nothing's spoken
Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star
Have confused all the conversations between y'all
And dog that's funny, pay me what owe me nigga
All cash money
Sweetie I hope you're takin' the lines down
Shake it and wine 'round
Twist up to this one
It's Drake and Divine Brown
It's new and improved, no mistakin' from afar
You just do what you do and I'll be waitin' in the car
Aw you can twist it up (yup), and you can let it flow (yup)
You can pull it back or leave it and let it grow (yup)
Braid it and put it under fleece in the winter
Just never slang it back with the piece in the center
Dudes be like, "Baby, boo let's go"
It take 'em time to get cute homie, you best know
I'm hot without a, you guess, oh
Cause I reside up north and ain't forcin' a U.S. flow

I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama's house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like, "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think its funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show and we...
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it, nigga
I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's popping off without us, nigga
We just want the credit where it's due
I'mma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house cause we...
No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stays the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stay the same through the money and the fame cause we...
A scrub is a guy thinks thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster
Always talkin' 'bout what he wants
And just sits and waits around, so
So don't go look at me with that look in your eye
You really ain't going away without a fight
You can't be reasoned with
I'm done being polite
I told you 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 thousand times
'Cause, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy who can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Tryin' to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy who can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Tryin' to holler at me
(Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me
You said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?)
Everybody get this goin' on
You know shorty and she doesn't want no slow song
Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose now in so long
I been inside, so you know I like to lay low
You've been peeping what I'm bringing to the table
Working hard, yeah, everything paid for
First, last phone bill, car note, cable
With my phone out
Gotta hit them angles
With my phone out
Snapping like I'm fabo
And I'm showing off, but it's alright
And I'm showing off, but it's alright
It's a short life, yeah
You say you love me
I say you crazy
We're nothing more than friends
You're not my lover, more like a brother
Known you since we were like 10
So, no, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time
That's a real one in my reflection
Without a follow, without a mention
I'm really pipin' up, I gotta be nice for what
I'm really pipin' up, I gotta be nice for what
I keep letting you back in
I cannot explain myself
You niggas wanna beat me like my cheer and appearance (shh)
You come up to my paper route, then pass interference
Now cash interference, I shine just like my earrings (bling)
It's fifty K today, twelve bars, I'll feed ya appearance
My stick up, it cost more than what you make in a year, man
Don't near man, theres no one near man, you're like a cheer man
No coachin, Gucci the GM and you're the beer man
Don't try me like I'm a pussy another tin man
Gucci!
Look, uh, feelin sorry for the runner up
I'm still away gettin money when the sun is up
And they keep sayin how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie starters can't put the numbers up
Maann, haters so pasé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day, nigga
And it's just me and my money, ya'll don't even get to play when ya'll are leading by twenty
Yeah, I infiltrated the game, I was hesitant at first and feared what it would change
Now I'm high of the success and faded off of the fame
But still I managed to keep all of my opinions the same
Man, I am So Far Gone, bitch I'm outta here
Hotter than santa inside rockin nauta wear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killin shit, I'm killin shit
Shoutout to the niggas I just made a couple million with
Yeah, from the beginning to the end
Know I'm into making history, not into making friends, motherfuckaa
Like a pimp, I pop my collar, act a prospect of tomorrow
Naw said life a bitch, so I'm a break her for some dollars
I will murder ever verse I ever versed to get the guala
I am cursed since I first dispersed a dime bag of guaca in exchange for a dollar
Red lipstick on a wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you want it fast? Define fast
'Cause I could speed it up and make it last
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed
I'm ready, I'm with it, still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well, I'm packed, too
Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you, bang
The baddest woman ever and the hardest out
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money to the death, I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready, too
Hope it's somethin' that you thought about
(I, I, I'm ready for ya)
Keisha get done, done, done, done at work, come over

But Keisha get done, done, done, done

More blue dot, more champagne
More girl love to heal our pain

Way before we had these fuckin' fancy ass fuckin' LED lights and shit
I don't even know what the fuck LED lights mean, but I'm payin' for them bitches
Way before we had this fuckin' cool ass stage and shit, we ain't had to shit like this
And definitely way before we had this stupid fuckin' ridiculous, expensive, blue for no fuckin' reason video wall behind me
We ain't have no shit like this man
The only thing we had- the only thing we had was classic shit like this
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Sing!
I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on Bragg boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights, please
Lights please, lights please
Sing!
Turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
Ah shit

And can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin', moanin', moan...
Hey!
Cole world
Fayettenam sing this shit!
Yeah, this is for all the fans...
That waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama; we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like- Hands up!
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing
Sing!
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
I got a new vision for all my shit
I don’t know what to call that shit
I know, I’m selling all of my cars
I’m selling all of my watches
I’m selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don’t need that shit
I’m a different breed with this shit
I’m tryna turn M’s to B’s in this bitch
And I ain’t ever pay to be with no bitch
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed
Fifty mill in one room, you, you could ask anyone out here
Who running the game? And they’ll tell you the truth
Man, they'll tell you
Oh look, they fuck with me now
I think they’re hearin' me now
Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like "I think they just might be scared of me now"
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Go, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka that’s grindin'
Twap, twap!
Twap, twap!
In the new house, we got the twap
“Grindin'” (word to Clipse) is the latest single from Lil Wayne’s upcoming album, Tha Carter V
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time gets to tickin' and it takes a toll
Told you I couldn't really draw the line
Line ringin', sayin' that you told him things
Things that you could've kept inside
Sidetrackin' me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya
Rule number one to be a boss-ass bitch
Never let a clown honey try to play you
And if he play you, then rule number two
Is fuck his best friends and make 'em yes men
That's how you feel?
That's how you feel?
I'm just in the cut sittin' sideways
Way that you lookin' all the time
Time, it done left you with a broken heart
Hardly excuses how you play with mine
Mindin' my business and then you show up
Up to no good, I should've seen the signs
Signin' me up to do your dirty work
Workin' to try to get you off my mind
I know you like to drink 'til the sun up
Grind 'til you come up
Work all winter, shine all summer
Ride for your brother
You die for your mother
Keep that shit a hunna
I know you wanna
Vacay to a place where you could
Take pictures, post on Insta
Your friends say they miss ya
But they don't really miss ya
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one boy
And he's the reason it happened, but he's overreacting
And it's all because he don't want things to change
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, he knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)
We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Yeah you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Yeah you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you every thing I love
I think there's something
(I think there's something)
I think there's something
(I think there's something)
You're the girl
You're the one
Gave you every thing I love
I think there's something
I think there's something
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Yeah you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
Ooo-hoo
When we hooked up years ago, you were supposed to come on the show, it didn’t happen but we connected the day after and did a legendary interview in Hyde Park. I said it felt like you’re gonna make history
How’s it feel to go from doing mixtapes, So Far Gone was the mixtape that really broke, before that Lil Wayne mentioned you in an interview with me, and I started following you and it’s just grown. From there you’ve been non-stop, its crazy…
Yeah that was an amazing time for all of us… still doing it with the same people. It was just… our landmark for that project is 15 Fort York, which was “40” and Oliver’s apartment and we really started that project there. Then it moved to the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA, when we were first just getting around Wayne, I know Wayne mentioned me in the interview, but the real turning point for me was when Wayne went on stage at the MTV awards and rapped one of the verses from ‘Money To Blow’. Instead of doing his own verse he just impromptu rapped one of my verses. And at that time, people are like, people from back home who really didn’t….. I mean it was just a tough thing to believe like, “I know he says he’s over there but is he gonna come home with a Lil Wayne record, is this gonna really happen” at that time people were like “ok he just rapped Drakes song, if he gets a Wayne record this is outta here”
That was when I was able to come back off those trips with Ransom. I went back home with Ransom, which was the first time I had ever got a Lil Wayne verse. From there I had a bunch of songs that I had recorded at the studio called Hot Beats and Wayne just got on all of them like ‘Stunt Hard’ and ‘Forever’ was one of them, early early. Then we started crafting that first project and using the input of two people who again I still work with to this day and my music wouldn’t be what it is without them, that’s Oliver and ‘40’ – you know it’s funny cos we’re sitting here talking and they’re back in Toronto executive producing ‘More Life’. Oliver’s executive producing it and ‘40’ is obviously always involved, but kinda just a full circle moment for us, cos Oliver had so much input on ‘So Far Gone’ so I was like “man it would be nice to do something with me and you again”, so I gave him that task and he’s at home piecing it together. So yes it was a great start and from there it just became a wild journey that I guess we’ll talk about
A lot to talk about – ‘More Talk’…
Since we’re right at the beginning, I was in Amsterdam with Lil Wayne….and he tells me – Yo he’s been writing on ‘Detox’ that was like the mythical album, you gotta be about your business to be involved in that, or to be in the studio. How did you end up from doing a tv show to working with Dr Dre, writing for him on Detox? It’s taking it back…
Its taking it back, I’m not usually that good with the ‘taking it back moments’ but I actually remember this one vividly. But yeah, I was on the show and while I was on the show, I started getting less and less character time, because of the fact that everybody was taking a notice to just the fact that I was more focused on music. And at the time I actually had a studio that was right by the film studio for Degrassi, so I ended up working out a deal with the after hours staff where I would leave work, go home get my stuff – Degrassi was all the way in the east end, which is Scarborough that’s like an area of our city. I’d go home all the way back to the city, get my stuff, come back to the studio, I would record and around 4/5am I would sneak back into Degrassi, they’d let me in and I would go to sleep in my dressing room. Eventually they found out what I was doing and they got really upset. During that time I was crafting all these songs, and I had a song that Omen produced – it was me and Mickey Factz and somebody else was on it I think. So Dre had heard the song and he had hit me like, “man I need proof that you wrote this” (laughs), so I had to fax him the lyrics of the song, I had to send him a fax message, from my moms fax machine in her bedroom I sent him a fax
You know at that time, Detox was going on, it was more like he had just a camp of people, I guess churning out ideas and just trying to spark something. I was flown out to record at Record One, which is a legendary studio. Yeah I was in there for a while, I did a lot of work, me and ‘40’, always brought ‘40’ with me, that was like a stipulation in my career, I wouldn’t move without ‘40’, so brought ’40’. Got to meet a lot of great people, obviously got to work with Dre, and it kinda all came to an end, when I.. Dre brought me into his office and said “Man you’re doing really good work” and he gave me a $10,000 cheque, and it was the most money I’d ever had in my life and at the time I was in a relationship. So I got the money and I called my girl, and I flew my girl down to L.A and was like “we can get a hotel this is crazy”, it was just a joyous moment for me. And I had missed studio or I had done something wrong, I had let my mind deviate from work and I had missed something, and next thing I know I was sent home and that was kind of it. It was a huge life lesson for me and I still have that… Actually when Dre came out at the Forum, I brought him the $10,000 cheque cos I had saved the actual hard copy of it, even though I got the money for it, they let me keep a copy of the cheque
So yeah that was kinda my dealings with that very early on, and I had heard rumblings, like oh all these people are here and I had met Snoop, and I kinda wrote this song, that ‘40’ still has somewhere for Dre and Snoop. We listened to it not to long, couple years ago, its kinda hard. But yeah it was a great experience, a great learning experience for me and ‘40’, it brought us closer and it just taught us about how this shit really works and I think that set us on our own path
So lets fast forward to 2015/2016, VIEWS one of the most successful albums, the tour you did in America was the most successful tours. How do you feel about what you achieved with VIEWS and the reaction? It’s a very pivotal point for you, going from writing for Dre and being on a TV show all the way up to …
Yeah I mean, it was one of those moments in my career, where the album started to build and build and build and you know when anticipation starts to build, it can either result in massive failure or massive success. Obviously somebody’s watching over us and it resulted in massive success for us and it was also just an opportunity for me to really take a lot of risks that I felt I was ready to take at that moment. And yeah, I mean I was obviously very proud of it from the title to the cover, to just the styles of music that I felt we introduced almost as a package. It kinda started with ‘Work’ because ‘Work’ came out before my album, and then progressed into ‘One Dance’, ‘Controlla’, ‘Too Good’. But just the style of music that was making me happy at the time, because to be completely honest with you I was having trouble figuring myself out in rap at that time I was a very defensive individual just coming off the situations that I’d come off of. I was having trouble trying to make rap music where I was able to peel back the layers and every time I’d make a song – ’40’ is always really bluntly honest with me and was like “Man you really sound like aggressive and defensive” – and I was just trying to figure out why and I realised it was just a reaction to my previous situation that had kinda happened before that
So there was a time where I actually thought about taking the rap off of VIEWS and just making it an album full of music that made me happy with melody. But obviously I know why I’m here, I know who my core fanbase is, and so towards the end of the album, I tried to execute it as best as I could, on the rap end. You know I still listen to the bars and I know exactly where I was at and they are great to me, and they are time markers to me, but yeah, I guess we’ll get into ‘More Life’ after and how that situation progressed. But yeah VIEWS for us was, it was surreal, the numbers and all the things we were able to achieve, it was an incredible time for us. And of course in true OVO fashion we didn’t celebrate it all, we just kinda went on to working on the next thing. That was kinda it, it was just another album to us, it wasn’t my biggest album by any means, it wasn’t the one to me, it was just another chapter in the story but I’m very grateful for the people who enjoyed it and supported it. Whether people want to admit or not, the influence that it’s had on music, I feel is very evident, whether people don’t wanna say it
Did you know what you were doing when you made ‘One Dance’, Kyla’s on there, Wizkid is on there, it’s a truly global records, because I think very few people have done what you’ve done with mixing everything with the US, the UK and African sounds. Did you know how big it was going to be, it was the song of the year
It really all started with the Kyla record, it was just a song that I had played, we Dj at our own parties just because …
How did you discover it though, that’s like a UK underground Funky Sound…
I mean I just listen to a lot of music and I have friends with great taste in music, so I’ve been personally putting that song in my own playlist and DJ set for like four/five years now, I know it’s older than that, even just playing it and having people… What really set something off for me was having people in America come up to me and be like “Yo what was that song you just played?” and I would be like “man people really like that song but they don’t know it”. So I just, my brain started working of like how could I utilise a bit of it, there’s so many good pieces. So I introduced the concept to ‘85’ and I said to him like “man if we could make a beat, I don’t wanna do a cover I wanna write a whole new song, I just want Kyla to serve as the bridge or as a bridge to the next verse, or as a bridge to the next hook”, and he was like “alright alright cool”
I had the beat for a while, I was just trying to figure it all out, and at that time I had met Wizkid through Skepta, cos we did a remix of one of Wizkid’s songs together and it just kinda all really fell into place naturally. And when it was all said and done, it was one of those moments much like ‘Hotline Bling’, I just didn’t really know how people were gonna feel about it, and that was part of the reason why I dropped ‘Pop Style’ along with it, cos I was kinda almost nervous like man I don’t know, this is just so different, let me just make sure I drop a rap record, so people just know I’m still on my shit. And I remember Boi1da had walked into the studio one night and he had heard ‘One Dance’ and he just looked at me and he’s like “man that’s gonna be the biggest song of your career to date” and I was like “c’mon man it’s like, that’s a lot to say, we hope it does well”. And yeah he was right, and it was just the perfect marriage of a lot of things, so many thank you’s to Kyla for being so supportive, she came out to South Africa and shot a movie with us for this song, and you know of course Wizkid doing his thing, and yeah just the entire UK for supporting it and the world for being open to listening to it
I love that tempo, I love that cadence, those melodies, that’s the music that makes me happy in life, so it was great to just be able to just make something like that and shine light on a song from the UK that deserves it, because that’s truly a classic song
With ‘Pop style’ what happened with that, because when I got it originally it was Jay-Z and Kanye on it and they kinda weren’t on it?
Yeah, I was dealing directly with Ye and that’s the version that he sent me and that was what we talked about and he was like “man you know this is like ‘Pop Style’ featuring the throne, this is huge” and I was excited obviously anybody would be excited to see them link back up. And then I didn’t know what I was gonna hear. So when I heard Jay had two bars, I was like alright it is what it is, it’s cool I like that, it’s a little intro and Kanye goes off. And then you know I’m not really sure the details between how that conversation was miscommunicated or what they were going through at that time, or what anybody felt towards me or whatever it was, I’m not really sure but next thing I knew it just became a bit of an issue. And you know from there I don’t waste too much time, so I just was like alright cool I’ll finish it, I can rap as good as anybody else, so I’ll just go finish this song and put forth my own version cos I don’t really like… you know no one can dangle anything over my head in this business, I don’t play that. So it just needed to be done and I did it myself and yeah both versions exist, so when Kanye comes out to do it at the shows it goes crazy. I know he was really upset cos at that time we were working together pretty heavy and he really wanted to be on the record but you know…
On the Pablo tour, he said a lot of things that are well documented but he said, before the last show, he was talking about how he was sick of not being able to do certain things everyone should come together and just make music. Is it digital politics now that prevents things from happening?
I don’t know, I think everybody has their own little things going on, I’m not really sure what he’s referring to half the time, cos in the same breath, I went from being… like working on a project with him, to him sorta publicly shitting on me and DJ Khaled for being on the radio too much. But yeah I’m not really sure, everybody’s got their own thing going on. Again me when I hear that, I just distance myself from it you know, alright if that’s what it is I don’t really even understand the point you’re trying to make but whatever it is that you’re going through, I accept it, I don’t respect it at all. You know cos I feel like me and Khaled are just good people, I’m not sure why we’re the target of your choice that you made that night. And yeah I accept what you’re going through, and I just go and continue working on my own thing. You know the more and more this progresses, the more and more I just feel like keeping to myself, cos its just so unpredictable, you never know which way people are gonna go. I mean streaming is the new record business, so yeah I guess you could call it digital politics, that’s kinda a good name for a song, I might have to do that when I get upstairs
So with ‘Childs Play’ another banger, there’s a line on there where you say why you acting light? What does that mean?
Oh you mean “I’m acting like I’m light skin”, that line (laughs), that’s just sorta something people… that’s like very an American thing people say like ‘ah man’ you’re being light-skinned”, I guess they say it’s like ‘emotional’ you know. I just think it’s a ridiculous stereotype, but I was just kinda playing on the irony of it, cos I’m actually light skinned so it made me laugh so I said it. But yeah it’s just a silly stereotype in black American culture, that light-skinned guys are this way or that way, so that was just a little joke
When did you first experience racism, you’re coming from a dual heritage, your fathers black, your mothers white, it puts you in a predicament, when was the first time you really noticed you get it from both sides, or one side or the other?
Man you know, I’ve really been grateful in my life to be born in Canada and just the journey that I had growing up was so… it was just a very accepting journey. I always had friends from all different backgrounds, from different walks of life, we all get along, I never really notice colour, religion, we don’t live like that. There’s really not that much segregation in Canada, and especially in Toronto, it’s like a cultural mosaic. And I know I’ve said that time and time again, but it truly is, it’s made up of so many beautiful people from beautiful places and you get to actually learn and you don’t ever develop hate. You know, the first time I really experienced it, was when I got famous and went to America and people would challenge me, like I don’t understand how it works or like “your Canadian, you’ll never understand, like the Black American struggle, or you’ll never under…..” That was the first time I really got challenged, and it was by people I had met from America that were like even close to me at the time
You know, if I ever feel anything or if I ever feel like an outsider, it’s usually because I’m not American to be honest with you, that’s when I feel like people are against me or they feel like I’m not part of the…. I guess it’s got something to do with the fact that I have quite an eclectic make up, I am mixed, I am Jewish. Yeah but I feel like, at the end of the day when it comes to everything else I’m Black. I am referred to as a Black artist, last night at that Awards show, I’m a Black artist. I’m apparently a ‘rapper’ even though ‘Hotline Bling’ is not a rap song. The only category that they can manage to fit me in is a ‘rap’ category, maybe because I’ve rapped in the past, or because I’m Black, I can’t figure out why. Just like I can’t figure out why ‘One Dance’ wasn’t nominated, maybe because they can’t… I mean, well it’s just there’s pop obligations that they have and I fluked out, I fluked out and got one of the biggest songs of the year that is a pop song and I’m proud of that, you know. I love the rap world, I love the rap community, but you’re right I write pop songs for a reason, I wanna be like Michael Jackson, I wanna be like artists that I looked up to, those are pop songs but I never get any credit to that
And shout out… and by the way I’m speaking to you as a winner from last night, I won two awards last night, but I don’t even want them, cos it feels weird for some reason, it doesn’t feel right to me. I feel almost like alienated or you’re tryna purposely alienate me by making me win rap awards, or either just pacify me by handing me something, putting me in that category, cos it’s the only place you can figure out where to put me. And remember they don’t decide the winners, but they do decide the nominations so they have to play it politically. And shout out to Chance, for last night, like I said I’m speaking from a winners point of view and I’m so happy for him, I’m not talking about.. I’m not angry about how last night worked out. But when you ask me like where, like do I feel, like racism, or do I feel it the same as everyone else, yeah I feel it, I notice it going on in it’s own places. But thankfully I get to be around the greatest group of people, my friends are from all over the place, they like Lebenese, they’re.. I’m Jewish, most of my friends are from the Islands of Jamaica, English, so I mean, we just don’t really notice it like that until I start talking about the music business
Yeah it’s a really tough time in the world and again that statement has been said over and over again and I think we know it’s a tough time and I’m …
How did it feel to be on stage in Manchester when the Grammy’s were going on, you stuck to the tour..
Yeah I mean I did it because that at the end of the day is what matters to me that’s real life you know. I was pitched by the Grammy’s to cancel those two shows and fly and go sit in the audience to lose because they don’t air the other rap awards on TV. So I would have left 30,000 people hanging to sit there and just be there for their own ratings you know. The worst part is I expressed myself, like man I’m really thankful I was at those shows in Manchester cos those were two of the strongest shows that we’ve had so far. I texted somebody from the Grammys and was like I’m really glad I stayed behind, I really don’t wanna have this conversation about coming out there again and I got a text back that said ‘Blame It On Donald Trump’ – and I’m not gonna say who it is that I’m texting but this is like the institution, we’ve been conditioned to think that this it the true award for our accomplishments, for our music. By the way if you had a night like Chance last night, he deserves it, for his friends, for his family, for his collaborators, its amazing when they champion you. But all I’m saying is, to kids that will be coming up in the future and might now get championed or might not get that moment, that’s OK too. Because you have to realise what institution you’re dealing with. You’re dealing with a bunch of people that are just people at the end of the day and they’re either good people to the core or bad people to the core and we’ll never know. But I mean yeah, I was really glad that I was in Manchester last night, and like I said I’m speaking from the perspective of a winner, I won two awards, it’s just it really put it all in perspective for that thank God that I stayed here and did what I’m supposed to be doing for the people that actually care about my music, you know. Yeah man, that’s just kinda how I feel about that about this given time
Yo, nigga. What’s up? This is Glenn Lewis, man. Had to holla at my boy, Drake: the incomparable, illustrious, lyrical genius hailing from the one and only Toronto, Up-North.

Work, work, work, work, work, work
When you gonna learn
Learn, learn, learn, learn, learn
Don't want her to be
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurting
Trying to desert me
No time to have you lurking
I know you told me you don't like it
But you know I dealt with you the nicest
Nobody touch me you so righteous
Nobody text me in a crisis
And if I get another chance to
I will never no never neglect you
I mean who am I to hold your past against you?
I just hope that it gets to you
I hope that you see this through

You need to get done, done done done at work come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long-distance I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got bad women tryna tell me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the..

I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, just hold on
We're going home, we're going home
Just hold on, just hold on
We're going home, we're going home
I know exactly who you could be
-girl, you know me
Still with the dawgs that I grew beside
All the niggas 'round me ride or they die
Gotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by (Yeah)
I'm outside in an AMG (Oh)
Right outside-
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go L-A, V-A
N-Y, T-O
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin' at amazing'
Girls tryin' sell a whole lobby of us
Hear 'em all screaming then it's probably is
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Look
I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days, yeah
These days, I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently, yeah
And last night, I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it, I hope you can take it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I don't know how to talk to you, yeah
I just know I found myself getting lost with you, yeah
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you, yeah
And last night, I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it, I hope you can take it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted (yeah)
I just don't understand it
Tell the UK tings that I soon forward
I might go Visions with Skeppy
I might touch road, do section
I might just, I might just
Dreamin' of the places I can get to
Drizzle, all the mandem miss you
Man like that need a visa to get you, baow
But, girl, listen
I wanna do the things that I mentioned
I wanna benefit from this friendship
I wanna get the late-night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright
Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind
You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things would get cancelled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved

Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home
Alright, this is it right? We are rolling and we're recording, let's begin. This is a very special broadcast of OVO Sound Radio right here, Beats 1, Apple Music. Long time coming man. Long time coming man...long time coming, an exciting time, an exciting night for obvious reasons. Any way, man, here we are in the Safe House this is kind of...I suppose the official home of OVO Sound, this is the heart now of OVO Sound, here in Toronto, OVO house based in Toronto. Uhm...It's 40's spot, where the music gets made.
40's...uh what do they call it, like a brain child, brain child? This is 40's creation from the ground up...I mean I was here, man, when there were no walls. I was here when there was no...not even a hint of a studio, or any...and uhm, he saw it through to the end. I mean, incredible execution on a vision that he had from the very...very early on. I know he's always...he's always enjoyed living in the same space that he works in. So he's been able to build this...build this complex that we utilize to get the job done, yeah.
When you walked in here for this first time, because I always thinking like....rooms you can catch a vibe pretty quick Yeah And you know 40 obviously build this, you were there for the process...and when, you know, he called you in for the first session...did you, did you catch a vibe? Did you record something that first night?
I was here, uhm, I was here a few times as you know...I was here when this room first started functioning and everything else wasn't built. I think....I think maybe the first...one of the first things we did here that got released was probably "Back to Back" ironically enough, but I think that was kinda when we were kind of....That's how you, uh, that's how you broke the bottle on the bow? Haha that was like one of the first... On that track? That was like one of the first thingsWow. that we actually recorded and it...and it...Tangible energy from the get-go.
I mean, you know, just... Get it done. execution, man, just following suit. I watched 40 execute so I had to come in here and execute too, that's it. How many visitors really...I mean I know there's a lot of people in here tonight for obvious reasons, because, you know, we're tryna capture something. You know...but, uhm, you know, when it's, when it's... business time, how many...how many visitors generally roll through here? Cause the vibe I get is you guys keep it pretty...pretty light.
Yeah, I don't really. I'm not really into, like, a whole bunch of people and distraction, uhm...I have, you know, I have respect for everybody and their craft in whatever they do. So I expect the same thing when people come in here, I don't want a bunch of hustle and bustle, talking and...loud you know. And...and the other thing that's tough when you invite people in the studio...is they're obviously coming to watch something happen. Right.
And...and it doesn't always happen every night. You know...it's not like every night is some magic moment. I mean, there's nights of frustration, there's nights of nothingness, there's night of just...you know, uh...these little tactical, uh, things. That clinical, surgical edits and stuff that...it gets you know Housekeeping. Right. I pretty much gauge the, uhm... characters that are allowed to sit in here based off of how they conduct themselves on those type of nights. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I think I have a pretty immediate, immediate team that is able to sit in here and I...I...I...I don't want to notice you, and that's not to be offensive, I just don't want to know that you're here. I want to be able to...to get up and just go in there and spill you know. Not worry about people's feelings Yeah. or tensions or any of that, that makes perfect sense, you know. Today unless...you change your mind Laughing the album's done It's done. 40 sent it while the game was on. It's crazy, I mean we're literally watching the Raptors while 40 was...you know... Mhm. I think the line was from Noel was "right now we've been finished for seven seconds." Yeah hahahahaha.
Vincent like came in, he was like "but nah, I sent the...I sent the email seven minutes ago, we've been finished for seven minutes." And he want to his computer and he was like "ah, I never sent it." The game clock was kinda measuring the album clock too you know, it's synonymous tonight. Oh man the world clock has been measuring the album now...and, and to a certain extent that's your fault. Cause back on August the 6th in 2014 you announced the name of the record. Yeah.
Now...now I have...I spoke to your friend Skepta about announcing records prematurely. Mhm. And he was pretty straight about it, he wish he hadn't done it. He felt the pressure of announcing Konichiwa way up front, added additional pressure to him. I mean...you did it almost two years before you delivered the record. How did it work for you making that announcement, you know... in 2014?
I think the...the announcement was more than just the album title, it was just a shift in the city. You know, that we, uh...we saw an opening there. You know, it was, it was, the name took on a life of it's own. Uhm...and now the city is obviously referred to as, as what it is...Yeah. Uhm...and yeah, I mean...I...we're...me and Oliver are always, are very cautious about that. Uh...we never wanna prematurely announce anything, but I kinda feel like, like it's crazy that you say two years cause t really doesn't feel like two years. I mean, yeah, I just had this plan to finish this album and then...but I, I remember I was like "oh man, well you know, I'm gonna do a mixtape."
Just cause I'm just like at this place, where I'm..I'm in this hotel every night, I just wanna make rap music, and I always, always wanted to make a, a project with Boi-1da. Uh...just like, exclusively like his... his brand of music, like just hard ish, like uh...trying to snap as much as I could and get as many joints as I could in, in a short amount of time. Uhm...and so that's kind of, you know, I was really adamant about finishing that mixtape first and then I said, okay then I'll move on. I mean, when we...when we do these albums, and especially if it's me and 40...it's never not been me and 40...but, when me and 40 lock in. We really lock in ...yeah. and we take it very seriously and it's not... it's not like some rush job, you know? We...we, we'll sit there and, and we...like I said some nights we don't even come here and make music some nights we just talk yeah... we talk and we listen and you know, we try and figure out, what...what the direction is and what...what works for me... It seems to me, that might be a distinction because you blur the lines so successfully, it helps in the evolution of mixtapes. They've been around in existence for a long time and yet when you started to do and some of your peers started to do it at a similar time, these mixtapes were becoming blockbusters in their own right. They weren't just moving the streets anymore, they were actually moving the sales and the charts and you were touring off the back of these things.
Well, well that was it, I went...I wnt on a full-blown tour off of If You're Reading This It's Too Late.... It's crazy. ...and it went straight to iTunes and I feel like that's like a...that's a hundred percent a possibility, same thing we do with a lot of the OVO Sound artists, you know, it's like, why not? You put all this time and they're all original sounds, why should shouldn't it be able to be...you know, I understand, I understand...the...the joy of getting a free body of work from somebody, but you know, this is like one of the only platforms we have left to like generate interest and income and all these, you know, these...get the attention and make it that easy to access... and focus... as opposed to going to ten different places to try and find it once links are being you know...so I mean... It's focusing your audience, isn't it ultimately? Yeah and that's really what it's about right now, is, is...and that's, I mean not to shamelessly plug but even...you know, what we've been doing with Apple Music and stuff like that...it's like you know, just focusing the audience and giving them a place to go and hone in on this one hub to go get everything.
Uhm...but with that being said, you know, I...I finished that tape and I was really happy with it a lot of the songs got bigger than expected and we had to go do some shows... I wondered that...I wondered, you know, if it...I mean I know you dropped it in the early hours in the morning and it was just like "Wake up surprise, here's a Drake record" and everything else, but i know how I felt about that album and millions of other people do as well and that record has become, in many respects, a modern-day classic...and I wondered if that caught you off guard?
Uhm...yeah I definitely...I definitely always just treated it like a mixtape. I...I was never...you know, even the difference between this album and that is like...the...the time we spent on the transitions, the layering of the production, the...the changes...just, just...sonically even, the time that 40 and Gadget put in...uhm, you know...this was just a tape that we did in my hotel room at the end of the day...Laughing so, I mean, it's...it's great that people love it, I mean, I always just looked at it as a bridge to get to where we're...we're at today. And then...and then from that, I mean, I ended up going to Atlanta and sitting with Future for six days and he's just a... a monster ...he's a machine, it's crazy, I've never seen anybody with that much of a catalog...like I mean, songs that I still think about to this day that I heard in that studio, that I'm like "when is that coming out?"
Oh, I've seen him...I've seen people loading projects
Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together moving
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus
Blue green jewels with the supreme fuel
And looking raw up in the cut
While i lay back cool and moving
Right to left, moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
Wooden leather, base model never
Holding birds of a feather
And we all are seen together
Moving right to left
Moving right to left, moving right to left (left left)
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise
If finding somebody real is your fucking problem
(Uh) Bring your girl to the crib, maybe we can solve it
If finding somebody real is your fucking problem (I mean yearly 16s)
(Uh) Bring your girl to the crib, maybe we can solve it (Uhh)

Ayy, I gotta stay in my zone
Say that we've been beefin' dog, but you on your own
First night, she gon' let me fuck 'cause we grown
I hit her, gave her back to the city, she home (She at home now!)
That was that, so I can't be beefin' with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you livin' in a mansion in all your raps, though
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though
Migo trapphone, runnin' water on my Rollie in the sink, in the sink
Hit the spa, a nigga workin' out the kinks, out the kinks
Out the kinks, sent my girl to the salon
Only one to go from six to twenty three is me and Bron
Know I
Yo, Drake. What up? This is Keeyaga, your boy here. Umm, I don’t know why you’re not picking up the phone, you’re probably out, you know, talking to Lindsay Lohan, or will be talking to Tyra Banks whatever. But, yo, check it out, it’s your boy Keeyaga. I’m just calling to say what up, haven’t talked to you in forever, indefinitely. You know, we need to go, you know, downtown Toronto, kick it together and do what we gotta do, but, uh, I gotta, you know, get off the phone because I have, you know, Beyoncé, you know, Eva Mendes all on the other line. So, yo, do what you gotta do, and holla at your boy man. All the best. Peace
But I ain't changin', elevatin', doin' more, I'm not just maintainin'
That's why I hate when I see a nigga
And I ask him what's been up with him and he say maintainin'
Eighty pointers up in the necklace (Huh)
Insane jungle boys sellin' cookies 'cause I'm connected (Woo)
Yeah, whip it in the pot, this shit is lockin' (Cap)
I really play with a bird like I'm Dennis Johnson (Hah)
While niggas milly rockin', we got the city poppin' (Uh huh)
Twenty-K on Rodeo what I consider shoppin'
I can tell your record deal was horrible
I got rich on my own, that's real applaudable (Talk to 'em)
This new album a wave, boy, I'm feelin' nautical
Sold crack on May Street, now I'm in Billboard articles (Uh huh)
Shot in the head, they said my grill ain't marketable (Okay)
Now I get DMs from bitches sayin'
"I seen you lookin' good on Jimmy Fallon show, that's real remarkable" (Hah)
Hundred-K on my wrist, how's that still affordable?
Machine
Ever since I left the city…
Alright, let's see you do your best Drake impression
Something like this
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I won't ever know
Uh, but here goes nothing...
Just me and my baby to fly
Oh, I just want to glide it out
Something like a Bonnie and Clyde
Oh, I just want to ride it out
Breeze into my kinky hair (Breeze in my kinky hair)
This is how we take trips, ooh
Aston Martin, you know we go hard
Let 'em push and park
Go and let up the top
Just me and my girl, yeah
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night

Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I won't ever know
Uh, but here goes nothing...
I'm not trying to be no one's star
Starter was assigned to me
I'm just trying to be who I are
The battle wasn't meant for me
I ain't trying to be the next baller
My top's down, I'm so cool
If you want, I can ride you too
Let's go make these moves
Aston Martin, you know we go hard
Let 'em push and park
Go and let up the top (Ballin')

Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music
Top down, watch out
Ring on, rock out
Pop bottles, lay low
Drive slow, it's cops out
We fresh as Dove soap
The bomb like flat out
Aston Martin swag
Burn you on the track, flat out
Aston Martin Music, Music (Ha-ha-ha! It's LP!)
Aston Martin Music, Music Yeah...It's Chrisette Michele and Lem Payne on the track...

Spliff burning with Matesa on, you feel me?
Lay back, just cruise
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go (yeah)
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing
Uh, everybody saying remember me
But where the hell is y'all memories?
I'm searching through walls of my membrane
It's insane, I'm entertainin' the big names
Through diamond, silver lining on my big frames
Niggas stressin' all I'm seeing through the Oakleys
Shit depressin', so we investing to blow trees
Had a dream I was chillin' in the OC
Then I landed out in Cali where they woke me
Discrete mumbles, from summer to street jungle
Voice from my uncle he tell me to keep humble
But at times I slip into deep wonder
Would they show they support in the event that my feet stumble?
See, when you already on, it's harder to say shit
Like the feelin' when you dazed and caught in amazement
Girls gotta stay separate from all of your statements
'Cause for the most part, hoes want a part of the payment
I'm relaxing in the Rolls Royce
Getting money 'cause I give these hoes no choice
I'm all alone in my box, blunt burnin' in the zone with my thots, wait
(uh, Mr. Peterson, January 1st, 0-11)
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the...

Jealousy’s something I haven’t felt for years
There’s nobody around for me to be jealous of

Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love but damn
They just need to enjoy it
Try and make it better instead of trying to destroy it

Digital camera, freeze the moments
Use money and talent as my lead component
Normally Drake sip Don P but
You the type of girl that I need Patron with
We could do it, corporate sponsor
Your man prolly riding in his boy's Elantra
You could drop him, he's forgotten, you got options
And plus I show these young boys how to bring the money on in
When they rhymes ain't hot, and they records don't sell
Stuntin' on the strip, came with no I.D
And I only brought cash, if they checkin' oh well
I'm good, Drake make one phone call and I'm inside
Welcome to the life of an icon
And I don't like jewels, but I am thinkin' of you
In the mirror while I'm puttin' all this ice on
So
Lloyd I see you Danny
Atlanta I see you, and if its ten
Toronto, Do it for Y'all
Yeah man
Yeah, sound sound sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind ’em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line ’em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends (from the ends)
We don’t love no girls from the ends (from the ends)
I’m gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I’mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain’t tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (what you say)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (what you say)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (what you say)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (what you say)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (what you say)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (what you say)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the one they want to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the woes I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (what you say)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (what you say)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (what you say)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (what you say)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (what you say)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (what you say)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man
Yeah, they don't love you like they use to (what you say)
In the city with the windows down like I use to (what you say)
Like I, take some getting use to (what you say)
Man, they don't love you like they use to man
Cause I know better than to let a
Bunch of them stop telling me
Cause I would never wanna give you up, so why
Do they keep talking when they know that it ain't right?
No, no, no
Can't tell me nothing 'bout my baby
Stance on, lean, the same old thing girl
There ain't a damn change that the fame gon' bring, girl
Uh, I'm first string, girl, handle a lot
'Cause up north is a scandalous spot
They think I'm pretty and rich
But pick one I'm on a Canada block
In some sweatpants, sandals, and socks, 'cause I can do that
I heard rappers wanna get into it
Until they hear the mixtape and they get into it
I used to pay just to get influence
Is nonsense, my advancement is a definity
Something that you rappers pressing to see, and I can do that
You need cash? Sure, I'll make it rapid for ya
You need it faster? I'll make it happen for ya
I bring drama in town, but don't worry
I'ma pull my pants up when your mama around, girl
Are you listening, is anybody listening
Walk into the room, and you can smell the cloud glissening
A lot of niggas is threatened by my positioning
Thrilling bars, you'd think I'm writing with John Grisham pen
I need Rosay, never mind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom, no licence
Fuck if you feelin me, as long as your wife be
No one in my city got a pocket like Drizzy
I got rock fitted jeans, cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black, and covers all insedentals
And Mr. Wrong, sorry, you ain't know thismy prosensal

Guess I got the mind of a little man
Then she tell a story, this shit kinda bitter man
You never hit, so you feel like a silly man
She never mention the spot that you fillin' in
She keep on tellin' your friends, your head in a spin
You can't even win, your head in a dance
She won't let it in, you spend it on her, she spend it on him
You see a check, then you see a grand
And ya'll take your pictures, save it a chance
She call you a name, you scratchin' your chin
You finally get it, you catchin' ahead
Suckin' your head, I'm far out the wing
And she tried to vent 'bout she wasn't in
How she really good, how she ain't a pimp
Then you take her back, she do it again
The story are, niggas are really a wimp, ey
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right, now that I'm here, baby
Show me a good time
How about you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight, and worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl, can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne, presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
People really hate it when a backpack rapper get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could: it's in our nature
Young and rich and out of control out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though, so I'mma spend another 10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it Yup!
All I gotta do is put my mind to this shit (goddamn)
They should call me James
Cause I'm goin' hard in this bitch
We're just so much smarter than them
Maybe I just needed you around me
Drank a lot tonight, I know
She can drive your car and you can roll
Take you where you wanna go
First off, I'ma start by sayin' this
Goddamn, goddamn
Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the...
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me
(EarlOnTheBeat)
Voltando pra casa, conheço o presidente, eu sou o Obama, ayy, eu perdoo o drama, ayy
Coloquei a língua Madonna, ayy, você precisa de pijamas? Sim
Fique de noite, garota, você prometeu isso
Me escondi na caverna como Osama se escondeu
Tô gastando grana no Diamond District
Você precisa de mim como precisa dos dólares que te devem, sim
Dinheiro e eu somos iguais, mas eu não desapareço pra você, sim
Corra até mim, irei colocar a Range na estrada por você
Eu não sei o que você falou, mas não estou bravo com você, bebê
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city you
Switched on who you said you wouldn't change on
Hung with clubbers until you became one
Now every night you dancing to the same songs
Cause ever since i left the city you
You've became more heartless and impatient
I swear this ain't the girl i used to hang with
I seen you round some boys with reputations
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

Maybe you've grown up, or I just didn't know ya
Please don't push me away, girl I'm just searching for closure
Let me dig alittle deeper, get alittle closer

But now I'll let you tie me down, something like a tennis shoe
And now I got bread I could grow, we can go do some things that we don't normally get to do
I feel good, I got some time off girl it's been so long
Did you have fun, cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring it to the crib and get all this, all this

You want this feeling back, well you should know

Everybody knows and I feel left out

Going places where you don't belong

You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling

This shit is all about hits and miss's

And I hope when dinners cold, my fingers do not dessert me
And these haters like, damb m
Gave a lot of women they first ride in the phantom
And yeah, I got a deal now, and I'm secure with it
And yet my life is so exciting, I get bored with it
I'm the best one out of my peers, and everybody pray I'm running out of ideas
Past my MOs, cause I shine so bright
And I'm the result of when it all goes right
So many pictures, man, the floor is a collage
Critics have hard time pointing out the flaws
All this slick talk, I just hope I don't fall
Right out of the sky, through the roof of your garage
I fuck with Slime man that's a fact, nigga Slatt
I told Gadget make this one pop, I swear that nigga got my back
They said I was done for good man all these records fucking platt
Was in the club at like 4 am I was laying down the Jacks
I said no to the Super Bowl just like Hov
Rolling paper back at home
Niggas chaka-chaka doing road
Don't got time for this shit I might switch my mode
Add the Richie to the Card
I don't want the Audermar
Take a Rocket out to Mars
I'm with Sheck I'm with Thugger
3 in the morning in the 'stu tryna make another
Bitch I'm smooth just like butter
Been making money, getting cabbage
But on real shit, Free up Savage
Ayobi
Yeah yeah yeah
I see changes
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither"
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I (Changes)
I see changes
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over (I see changes)
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh (I see changes)
Ayobi
“They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving this crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving this crew”
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Let me tell you a truth
It is amazing what this game could do to you
Fake cold may lose your soul too
And if you a fuu, the hook can get you though
If you knew what I do
What I went through
Thank you to the crew, I salute you
And if you go, I will give you a 21 salute as if you are camo
And we are good fellas mixed with regular dudes
So who knows if it could be me or you to salute
Like they say in the marines
Everyone wants to go to heaven
But no one wants to go with sleep’s cousin
And with death, it is not the greatest loss, but the greatest loss is what dies inside while still alive
And that is far worse crime if it kills time
But I guess it is also good to go with pride
And I want to express what’s inside outside but my enemies want to see my insides outside and I got to bottle it up and make whatever outside inside
Let me tell you a truth
It is amazing what this game could do to you
Fake cold may lose your soul too
And if you a fuu, the hook can get you though
If you knew what I know
What I went through
Thank you to the crew, I salute you
And if you go, I will give you a 21 salute as if you are camo
And we are good fellas mixed with regular dudes
So who knows if it could be me or you to salute
Where is your backbone, or your code at
A paradox that that make the real die quick
It’s hard to separate friends from enemies
Always show love but in their hearts they envy me and wait for the right opportunity to backstab me
Ride for me but still sell me
I got to ask dogs cause they have better answers than those snakes in disguise
But I guess righteous choices don’t pay no more and only god knows
But I promise for my crew I will hold you down
Let me tell you a truth
It is amazing what this game could do to you
Fake cold may lose your soul too
And if you a fuu, the hook can get you though
If you knew what I know
What I went through
Thank you to the crew, I salute you
And if you go, I will give you a 21 salute as if you are camo
And we are good fellas mixed with regular dudes
So who knows if it could be me or you to salute
Headstart, ready for war, raise your sword and play with fire
War without failure with a taste of pleasure and pain
Change the system, new gen revolution
Shifting powers, new forms of throne
Fear of getting out the zone
Pressure of making the right move
Play it wrong, you may lose your soul too
I'd rather have loyalty than love
'Cause love really don't mean jack
See love is just a feeling
You can love somebody and still stab them in they back
It don't take much to love
You can love somebody just by being attached
See loyalty is a action
You can love or hate me and still have my back
Jesus help me
Please just help me
Come right back again
Everything's okay
At least that's what
I tell my friends
But its all made up
And i have changed
Just make it for the best
Cuz it is if you say so
Say
Sittin' in a spin
Telling everybody where i been
But it's getting old
Wanna go back to me and my friends
When he hit the club
Everybody wanna see em
Tellin' me to drink up
Really drink up but I really don't drink like that
I am what I am

Why they in my biz
Why is everybody on my phone

Run up in ya song like "hollup"
Is-tan-bulla
Turkey zigguns
Swear i get up on the beat and murk these zigguns
On they mutha-mutha...
I don't really know
But the mighty head's the only one to roll
Don't ever really wanna know too much or at least
Don't wanna ever let em think i do
Aaye, its all right
Calm down
Son-
You ain't heard it?
You the bomb now son
They never gonn do -

And I don't got time for your drugs no im never doing drugs like that

But its alright- It's alright, it's alright
To tell the truth

Confessing my sins

Molested - uh.. i was young...

Sinner for tonight?

Futhamuckas only
Want me making
Beats for em on the side
I know how it feel to be the side
I would never make you that tonight
I mean i don't think you'd be everything
But...you'd be everything
How you feel about
Knowing all the
Secrets in my lines ?
Even if they really don't rhyme
Even say the same thing twice
Sometimes sometimes
...so
How you feel about
Knowing that i can't keep it to myself
I don't want you anybody else
I don't wanna keep it to myself
People : I don't like people
I don't deserve them
To my city
I get it i get it
Id never be hot there and thats why
Im not there i know i admit it
And nine out of ten times i
Wouldn't have doubted my self for a minute
But i swear it's taking so long that uh
Even my name reminiscing
It's one time
This cutting into my fun time
This ain't no game cuz i run time
It don't stop for a minute
Son i'm
Done wait
Lastly - God changed my life very fastly
Wanna shoot me down - that's yo ass b
Wanna go to heaven
Then you gotta let him be great
All I do is "Pre", don't leave me like I'm Dolph
This ain’t holy, when they see the chain, it’s not a cross
Put that owl on and you can never take it off
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Dawg!
Uh
Slide for my n******!
Stay Scheming, raise demons
All you haters f**k yourselves face to face penis
Can’t do it like I do it they just stay dreaming
I’m the truest if it’s music, on the stage screaming
Back to back a couple Jordans like I made millions
Just some thousand dollars
Regular whip!
Got some mileage
Trying to plot on me, they treat me like a graph book
Barack Obama or depict me as a mad Bush
‘cause I’m ruling this
My music now got mega downloads, so you could say I’m doing swizz
Quick to holla if she look like Alicia Keys
A couple chains on me, looking like I’m Mister T
I got them thangs! on me, looking like I’m with police
But I’m not with the law; I don’t roll with the badges
I rep the green white green, now you know what the flag is
Polo beneath my jeans, it will show when I sag it
Trying to play me for a joke, all these n***** clueless
I make the desert storm; it’s nothing like fabolous music
What ’re you scheming for? I don’t see your reason
You claim you’re shooting like you’re Kobe I don’t see your season
Slide for my Ni***Z dawg!, ride for my Ni***z Uh!
I’ve been trying all my life to fight my stomach growlings
My Pops told me that to be a man takes more than violence
I’m just trying to get a nut, like a couple almonds
My real ni***z stacking up, labor for allowance
But I’m kind ‘a imbalanced, when my paper’s deficit
Searching for a hustle, like another way to get at it
Tried to make a video, was looking for a camera guy
Took my money from me, left me nothing I was traumatized
F**k Jordan tower films, a couple bullets shower him, (fuck y’all ni***z)
A couple bullets shower him
F**k Jordan tower films, a couple bullets shower him…him
Couple bullets shower him!
Today? That should be my day of no luck
It’s the thirteenth/ weren’t we here just a second ago?
Oh, a year maybe? That’s my reckoning so
Recollecting on how we disconnected
I fell through the cracks/ came back nauseated
And hating the fact my insecurities kept pulling me down for real
So sick/ couldn’t go/ feeling to throw up
I was torn up/ thoughts tormented and so fucked
Going insane ‘cause I chose one
Couldn’t fathom ever having to let her go
And you know what? I’d be lying in my bed
Stare up the ceiling ‘til the minute that she’d walk by
And step inside/ say ‘hi’/ chill a bit
Then at best give a hug or a goodbye and yet
I would pray she stayed like the days that we lost
Making our way to the way that we was
But my major mistake – I remained unlocked
Put my all on display but then failure popped
Wave after wave but I still gave a fuck
Wish I was making this up but I’m not
There were days I would wake up and then doze straight off
‘Cause I couldn’t deal with it
Mind, body, soul set ablaze/ make it stop!
I would say to myself/ hate how I felt
This girl got me so dishevelled to the point
That the Devil himself couldn’t take it
And put in a request that I’d be sent straight out of Hell
I’m not one to place the blame for any of this major pain
That I was put through/ wishing you would say name
Because I felt hurt/ trapped in this cell worth less
And I ain’t even got to the L word yet
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
Say ‘baby, I love you’
If you ain’t running game
Say my name say my name
You acting kinda shady
Baby why the sudden change?
Say my name say my name
Say my name, ooh
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
See I felt hurt
But I never gave up/ I was mad/ too attached
I was dumb/ I was blind/ I was axing the facts
Ignoring every instinct/ collapse ‘em and act
Like everything was okay/ I was being me
Then I started seeing cracks/ soon enough
There was no way I could ever feel like I’d match up
To these man you would hang with so I backed up
Struggling in silence/ muffling my voice
No more muscle to get violent
Stepped up a gear still I felt like my rebuttal had no mileage
Tired out/ drained and trapped in this madness/ unh
At times I could swear I was an actor
Tryna be like these guys/ oh my…
Think back like “KD, why would you do that shit?!”
Selling out just to tell ‘em how you were there
Take notice but still you would let her down
You dived in headfirst/ got hurt and that’s it
Better man up and stand up and act in a manner
That won’t go expose just how deeply enamoured
You are with this girl and then damage your status
Shatter your chances/ your heart and your sanity
Man I remember that happening back then how manic I felt
What I had with this girl brought me back to anxiety (Ugh!)
Who the fuck was I tryna be?! (Ugh!)
Couldn’t help but think rightfully (Ungh!)
That you’d never be mine fully (Nah…)
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
Say ‘baby, I love you’
If you ain’t running game
Say my name say my name
You acting kinda shady
Baby why the sudden change?
Say my name say my name
Say my name, ooh
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
So a year back from today
I was in my room with a few tracks I could play
As a soundtrack to my night
We had talked/ sorted shit/ got along
No scraps on the plate but we still weren’t acting the same
Sat back had this one track on replay
Then I realised next day it was V Day
Fuck! We weren’t together but we were
So was I obliged to assign you a gift
And remind you of how much I liked you? Shit…
So I dashed out to get you some flowers but they were sold out
(Ah fuck’s sake…) Came back to my seat so defeated
I think that you came home late with some flowers and gifts
That some other guy showered you with
I ain’t gonna lie/ I was down I was pissed
Felt like I lost all power from my grip
I was bound to this black cloud hounding me
Sick…but I didn’t show anger aimed at a man that I didn’t know
Fuck that! I was down for that shit
Tryna decode everything you were saying
I was overthinking all these codes and meanings
In my Mona Lisa in the hope one day that you’d know I mean it
‘Cause the coldest feeling was not knowing
You see its…(KD!!!)
(Alright alright…)
Fast forward past all the bullshit and let’s look at March onwards
Skip ahead to tonight where I’m with you
But this time I got my flowers and gifts all ready to surprise you
It’s only now I look back ‘cause I can with a smile
Yeah we had those times/ you get mad all the time
But nowadays I don’t even have to ask if you wanna be my Valentine
I would never say that…
That was just for you…
It could all be so simple
But you'd rather make it hard
Loving is you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me who I have to be
’Cause no one loves you more than me
No one ever will
No matter how I think grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working, it ain't working
And when i try to walk away
You hide yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy
I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself
As painful as this thing has been
I just can’t be with no one else
You let go and I'll let go too
'Cause no one's hurt me more than you
And no one ever will
No matter how I think grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working, it ain't working
And when i try to walk away
You hide yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy
Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won’t you live for me?
Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you’d be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me
Everybody get your mothafuckin’ roll on
I know shorty and she doesn't want no slow song
Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I’ve been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First, last phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off but it's alright
And you showin' off but it's alright
It's a short life, yeah
That's a real one in your reflection
Without a follow, without a mention
You really pipin' up on these niggas
You gotta, be nice for what, to these niggas?
I understand
You got a hunnid bands
You got a baby Benz, you got some bad friends
High school pics, you was even bad then
You ain't stressin' off no lover in the past tense
You already had them
Work at 8 A.M., finish 'round five
Hoes talk down, you don't see 'em outside
Yeah, they don't really be the same offline
You know dark days, you know hard times
Doin' overtime for the last month
Saturday, call the girls, get 'em gassed up
Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off but it's alright
And you showin' off but it's alright
It's a short life
Where were you when I needed you?
Where were you when I needed you?
Where were you when I needed you?
Where were you when I needed you?
Trust me this ain't about revenge
But now I get along better with your friend
What if I kissed you right now
How would we explain it
Trying to imagine how it might sound
If I just yelled out
What if I kissed you right now
Would it bring us any closer
Take the weight off our shoulders
Take me I'm yours
And I don’t really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions
If we were a secret how long could you keep it
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
...away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine
What if I kissed you right now...
Would it bring us any closer
Take a weight off of our shoulders
Tell on me
I dont mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie...
...admit that I’m yours
I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions
If we were a secret
Tell me could u keep it?
Keep it your yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
...away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine (just be mine)
And you just be mine.. all mine

What a time to be a slime
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
You used to call me on my
Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That could only mean one thing
Well, ever since I left the city, you

Ever since I left the city, you
You used to call me
You used to, you used to
Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the...
I want some, don't try me, I'll set this bitch on fire
Told the chauffeur, won't you shut the fuck up and drive?
Told my mama, I don't need your fucking advice
Since then I have never felt so alive
Help me out
Help me out...
Tell me now
I know, hey, hey, hey
They want to tear me down
Paper thin, paper thin
...if you ask it be
Followers, minions
...My paper thin love
I write you up just to tear you down
I can't deny you, you're my
Paper thin love
I write you up, to tear you down
Paper love
I write you up just to tear you down
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I'm sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
You don't even drink at all, yeah-
I'm just here, here spitting realness
You know just trying to pay the bills and
I make music trying to get the millions
I was In love even told that girl my feelings
Now I Leave it to God and hope she feel it
But right now I'm focused on making killings
O.J the game consider me the villain
But I'm Wayne right now I have no ceilings
Black eye peas man i got a feeling
That the games our money women and the children
Man I turn up as soon as we in the buildings
We spit flames even when we was chilling
But Now i'm focused things in motions
Flow fluid and deep as the ocean
No more coasting I'm just roasting
All my goals on the gram I be posting
Some videos on snapchat
Turning up with the ovo hash tag
Couple checks girl i might cash that
I'm feeling good that I did good in math class
Now all that success you can add that
Those who me doubted me subtract that
Distribute goals with my woes
I do what I want why cause I'm Grown
I just ask you That you keep it keep it real
Spock logic i dont get caught up in my feels
I just Keep it keep it real
Divide that pie with my fam
Those Who keep it keep it real
And all of my good friend Who Stayed
Real to that real end
Anakin: I hate you!
Obi Wan : you where my brother Anakin...
I loved you
Ice: "Finally moving up in the business
I know you gone look after family "
Mitch : what family you talking about Ice?
Ice: heh F*ck, I look invisible n*gga?
Mitch: I'm broke baby I ain't got no money
Thoughts so calm
Mastermind of consciousness
Master with a plan or disaster is the consequence
The Benz polished short sight and not confidence
With the faith of a mustard tree, we move continents
Made marvellous, results of a God who thought of us
The same God became a martyr to harbour us
Cold hands in this blood stained promise
The only Man who kept a hundred percent when He promised us
Peace
And a release from the harmfulness
Imagine that heaven only charmed and had come to us
Maybe it's the only thing that belongs to us
Maybe we haven't belonged long enough
Maybe we let sin become a part of us
Maybe we need life water just to wash us up
Not a doubt in my mind that water isn't strong enough
I tried
This evil in my soul is too hard to scrub
If you thought I'm upset I bond to this carnival
And alarm don't worry my struggles aren't hard to you
Why do I question God's love like it's so hard to prove
Know you only exist cause God thought of you
Now figure that, it's hard to do
Go and try can I promise you it's hard to do
Every mistake that we make it's still starting to
And I'm the one that did it, it's almost like I saw Tucson bleeding ruse
No justice that a song could do
But the moment He looked at me I saw the truth
Some of us just sell amount to put on some jewels
Pharmaceutical dreams of being rich
No one can lose, small pursue
Occupied mind made for larger moves
I'm tryna live, I'mma follow ones for two
Technically a branch, call me palm trees
Simple rose ain't white linen it's south beach
Red carpet up but I keep a hood reach
Hood bleeding so I cleaned it with the good bleach
And every industry rapper we yell preach
They only spit truth right, *beep* please
Man we talk about the cake
Sierra mist with the jelly on the bass
Got a sweet tooth stir it up and then bake
Give you type two, cold body with the shakes
I ain't frontin' B
And you can never have enough of it
Talking Grandino
Grant got me blessing, Franklin off the ego
Room so free-o
Chains got me starring out the peep hole
Schizophrenic, but I keep it on the d-low
Money's the route of all evil, amigo
Cake it, cake it
No celebration like who ate the cake
Winners so said it so what you do with Jesus Christ the only thing that will remain
What they saying, cake, cake, cake
They said they cake, they said they cake, they said they cake
Cake, cake, cake
I heard 'em say cake
They say the cake
They say the cake
They worry 'bout that cake
They focused on that cake
Oh oh
I ain't worry 'bout that
I tell them I
Burn it up
Tell 'em that I burn it up
Take that money and I burn it up
Money and I burn it up
Take that money and I burn it up
You know I do burn it up
Hotline Bling, take 76
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
I’m scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone
But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
Say my name

I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?

Keep running through my mind, jog my memories; amnesia
Touch ya, tease ya, nervous?
Don't freeze up She let me take control, I run a woman like a Visa
She always run back to me saying he's a Dog off the leash, he got this other girl Alicia
She tell me she's in hell, I tell her take a breather
I'm nothing like your man, but I can't love you neither
It's wifey over bitches
But money's over her Cause money's under nothing
My life is such a blur
It's not the way it has to go, it' just what I prefer
And any Young Money nigga I know would concur
Weezy talk to 'em!
Shawty got a man, but I got a plan
Listen, homie, I ain't trying to force your hand
But I'ma take your girl
I'ma take your girl
And her girls and they girls

Look, I ain't never had a benzo
Nope, I pushed me an Ac wit the tintzo
Nosey niggas is peakin' in my window
Have a hard time looking
I tell you second hand that's a hard grind cooking
Cause my pop was in it so deep
If his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage
Instead, I drop bars like I'm two months sober
Its my time now so them you months over
Yeah if I want it I find me a way to get that
I'm trying to get to the point where I can sit back
Took a lot of patience and action
I grind so I'm anticipating relaxing
I'm thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts
I don't need brothers fillin' space in the back than
So from the kid with the sun tan flow
The hottest ticket in town to this one man show
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
I can easily make'em admit to bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah you best believe that I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So they don't like me and throw parties and yet they never invite me
I can't lie sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm and its obvious so who can tell
And no this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
Couple things that I do that well
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble but I live vain
With more deals on the table than a bridge game
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E
I think that you know as well as I know
People checkin' for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that it's me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I D.I.E

Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'
Mixtape, I been working on this mixtape
Nigga if you been sleeping on me, that's a mistake
Just think, I been doing this since 6th grade
Back when all my Jay-Z covers only got like 6 plays
Did that satire shit and got on Renegade with J
Got on Rap Genius, then I did them verses with Sway
Now everybody telling me that all my shit's great
I'm like thanks but I think that ya'll a bit late
Aye, but at least now they seeing me
You officially listening to V.E.N.D
When it comes to MP3s, I'm the MVP
Nah it's all about me, I'm the TimVP
Man, I'm just rapping for respect, you know I gotta get it
Flexing on the track just like a nigga ate a lot of spinach
Did you get that last line? Man ya'll prolly didn't
Ya'll niggas still ain't get like half the lines in no competition, nah
Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
She invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
No tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'
Okay I had to switch the
Flow up on you niggas, shit was getting to predictable
Painting a picture with these words, the flow is visible
And if that is the case, then these ain't verses, they visuals
Now picture this, I'm not tryna get all deep and visceral
And you might find these theory to be completely dismissible
But how can you follow a crowd and be an individual?
That's oxymoronic, like the homeless performing rituals
It don't add up, so you niggas will never get the sum
If you can't see this star in the making, you'll never get the sun
If you can't see this war that I'm waging, then it's already won
Ya'll never been inspiring, believe me, this shit's already done
I just named 4 Crash songs, and you ain't even know it
All these niggas tryna save the game, they tryna be heroic
I'm just proving that ya boy can spit, and that you need to know it
But after this song, I don't really think that I need to show it, nah
Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
She invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
{PART 2}
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'
Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'
Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
They told me all of my lyrics are never ever fly
They told that I suck and that I should never try
They said "Virtual Entertainment Never Dies
All the songs are free cause it's shit that no one would ever buy"
Whole time I was like, okay whatever guys
All that negative bullshit, I set aside
Cause it turns out that them niggas were never right
Cause this verse is so much better than anything they'll ever write
If you a pest to me then consider this verse some pesticide
If they say that I'm wack, it's just some lies, I'm the best alive
Anyone wanna come prove me wrong? Then I suggest you try
Anyone wanna come at me wrong? Then I suggest you hide
With this tape, you know it's safe to say the best has just arrived
I bet you guys get petrified every time that I testify
The best is I, and it's about time I start getting recognized
When I meet Mr. West some time, that's when two of the best collide
I really hate to be this guy
But I think I'd rather be seen alive, than sing a lie
Nowadays, the real nigga get penalized
If they not rapping 'bout trapping more than a venus fly
You know I really hate to be this guy
But who says the limit has to be the sky?
That's a mentality that should be despised
Cause I'm out of this world, so that saying should really be revised
My talent will never be disguised, so you can't be surprised
If you niggas still can't see my rise, get some eagle eyes
Fuck how horribly this entire mixtape is equalized
I'm not tryna get on the radio, I'm tryna Ether guys
D.E.A.D. Entertainment, we on top, and you can't beat the guys
The clique is Susan Storm-Richards, you can't even see the guys
Rolling with the cheese and the dough, like the pizza guys
Came to give the game a spark, I'm feeling like I'm Lisa, guys
I'm going in, but I gotta save, I got 7 tracks left
Will them bitches be any good? Ain't no tellin'
Mixed this whole fucking thing by myself
Will these verses sound like they should? Ain't no tellin'
Police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, but we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'
No tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
No tellin', ain't no tellin'
Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
No tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
You got my nerves gone
When you swerve off, turn your phone off
And dont call back,shit
Ill give yo ass about two weeks till you beggin back for my dick
Got that good good you can't get
From some other dude that dont give shits about you or yo feelings
Girl, Im what you missing
Im, christian no religion
Um, jeans tru religion
I, spoiled you last christmas
Empty stockins this year but its cool cuz I got some bitches
Thinking new years new mission
Uh, new thoughts new positions
Im the boss in this building
Pull your apllication for business
Mrs. cuz you married
To me it mean that maybe you gone love em till the day he
Slip up get caught cheatin
Then I'll b there for the time being
Baby girl we jus human beings
Make mistakes we dont mean to make
Out of all the things that ive ever seen
You seem to me like a piece a cake
Do my thing and then maybe skate
If the pussy good then I'll prolly stay
If the pussy good then I could eat for days
If your attitude at a latitude where I dont need no parachute
Then turn over let me handle you
Tip me, gratitude
Kiss me, red lipstick
So they know who I'm tached too
So I know its real get a tattoo
Then that dude, and that dude gone recognize that I had you
This roller coaster move faster
Nothing ever gets passed you
Stalking me and my tags with some old chicks that I smashed
Insecure bout yah ass
Insecure bout your class
She need to be self secure with a confidence that dont ask
Im coming down, crash
Aterol, hash
Alcohol, extacy, and two lines threw my cash
Friends callin me cabs
I dont know how to act
Im too faded thats fact
Two ladies when I wake up, they prolly think that I'm famous
Nameless, shamless, in my bed butt naked
Asking me where they pay cut
Wtf was I thinkin
3 benjamin franklins got em comin over 3am
So I send a text now im waitin well alright
Now thats SO C-Lee...haha
Woah, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man if pole dancing's an art you know how many fuckin’ artists I know
Got some new bills in the mail
Got some big favours I owe
Got some good things ahead of me
When these bad bitches let go
Well, girl let's go
Walk your broken heart through that door
Sit yo sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs jus’ ain't you (be you)
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown
It been going down it ain't new
That’s that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But its all good, don’t stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
You don’t really like attention, I don’t know if she gon manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place
Shit I did all of that on my own
Oh yea...
Feel the moment
But think what you've forgotten
God and gotten rotten (got it!)
Just remembered a thought or two about it
('Bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it)
You ain't 'bout it
If only you'd allow it (to grow)
Louder, scream it louder
I can't hear you! Louder!
I hate crowded rooms, I'm a little claustrophobic
That's why I let my feelings out it in the open
I don't like to hold them in
Hate how it's been an hour
I'm an hour clerk, I just count the time fly by
While I'm sitting in my math class
Man I hate class, but I still have it
Ain't that ironic?
Girl, I got it going on, I got it going on
What's the 411? What's the 411?
I got it going on, I got it going on
What's the 411? What's the 411?
Girl, I got it going on, I got it going on
What's the 411? What's the 411 hun?
You won't feel me 'til everybody say they love you
But it's not love, bring it down an octave
Cause you're just another kid that the crew can get rid of
They say be quiet and stay silent
But you just staying loud, keeping proud
Cause you were taught that they were born to listen
And that you were born to fix up all the broken niggas
Bitching on the second level
Who are you to try? These niggas lost their lives?
Well, I just thought I'd offer one
You won't feel me till one of your ex girls gets knocked up
She says she took a step but he took it further
Thinks he ain't mean to hurt her, she says shes certain
But now its been a month, so now she has her doubts
Yeah she has her doubts and you have your doubts
Cause you warned her bout the route she's taking
See you always have advice, so you always giving
But they don't ever listen, they just pat you on your back
And say they "feel you", nigga
I've been fading too long
I've been fading too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride
You won't feel me 'til you're at your mother's funeral
And you're the only one not crying
Cause you can't get it through your head that she passed on
Yeah, she's really gone, no, she's really gone
But you just don't believe it, you think they got it wrong
You won't know me till your friends
Start laughing at you like some damn Hyenas
Reminds you of Selena back in eighth grade
When she said that, "You're doing wrong,"
That, "You need to change"
"Life is not a fairy tale, it ain't no fucking game."
You're gonna hate me, I swear, you're gonna hate me
When you catch kids sipping Pinnacle during missionary
Meanwhile, you bringing dead energy to a cemetary
Searching for your mother's grave
Crying yourself to sleep at night, cause you ain't got it right
You ain't even write a letter to say bye or nothing like
Your Dad fucking hates you, Mama's outta songs
Grandpa pays the bills and you always feel alone
So, "What's good at home? What's good at home?"
If you keep on X and O'ing, keep on telling lies cuz
"I feel you", nigga, I feel you
"What's good at home? What's good at home?"
If you keep on X and O'ing, keep on telling lies cuz
"I feel you", nigga, I feel you
Yeah, yeah—I feel you
Yeah, yeah—I feel you
Yeah, yeah—I feel you
Feel the moment
But think what you've forgotten
God and gotten rotten (got it!)
Just remembered a thought or two about it
('Bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it)
You ain't 'bout it
If only you'd allow it (to grow)
Louder, scream it louder
I can't hear you! Louder!
Been an hour, I'm an hour clerk
I just watch the time fly by
Sitting in my math class, man I hate class
Ain't that ironic?

I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I can't get across to you
Yeah and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
Years go by so fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this (We gotta take time with this)
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
And I hope you can take it
Houstatlantavegas (ay), Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay), Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay), Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh
Last year I caught a body for sure
I gave him punch after punch; Gotti and Ward
I had him makin' excuses, soon as he walked through the door
Bulletz was hangin' onto his chest like a Somalian war
You lose a lot, I maneuver plots
I'll kill you with the cool side of the pillow, word to Stuart Scott
You were hot, in the WRC's but your future flopped
You get more ass every year that's a booty shot
I heard Uno boned your ex, banged her for weeks
Did her worse than Mystique then shovel danced in your sheets
Then I heard you guys ran train, I guess Peter is right
You two time everything, even your wife
I'm so deadly, two can' same result; Coke/Pepsi
You get ex'ed out and stay thirsty; Dos Equis
I saw you get killed by Dan, don't test me
You let that man go nuts in your face; Loe Pesci
You traveled all that flight distance and I'm glad you made it
Cause as soon as they turn that FilmOn we seen that Rich bitch fuckin' up more battles than Alki David
You seen that footage; Lush wrestling Alki
Ran up on him, then grabbed his neck in the lobby
This would've been similar to that, I'd be catchin' a body
Cause that Rich fool be chokin' in the ring more than Ted Diabiase
Yeah I brought bars about wrestlin' moves
You're the fuckin' man for tryin' to step in his shoes
But now I gotta leave you dead, you'll be left in a tomb
Jimmy Fallon Show, leave him next to The Roots
Kick him a couple times, like, "Yeah that's a real body"
I don't feel this pussy; Charron when he drills Tarsi
I know your real hobbies, playing online poker and beer pong with Bill Cosby
First punch, put him in a daze, that's Rico
Second punch, put him back in a daze (days); that's Skee-Lo
Third punch, death ridin' beside him, that's evil
Fourth punch, they'll be ridin' (writin) together Mac Lethal
That BOLA shit, right?
He hit me like, "Pro it's last minute are we riding together?"
I was like, "From the airport?" He was like, "Nah, literally writing together?"
Fuck that I'm applying the pressure
This is Pete's peril, a last second call got you picked off; Pete Carrel
He's like, "Yo when you see Hawks (Seahawks)" you blaze nada
How did y'all expect a gambling addict to save Dolarz?
I know you're in Las Vegas, playin' your little cards
And late night The Saurus goes to underage titty bars
He's like, "Do those exist? Man that isn't real
But then he turns into Loaded Lux when he gets caught, "I just had to get the feel"
I'm just freestylin'
You should be on Loaded Lux level, I mean The Saurus old
He was battlin' since cave painting in Morse code
You can tell a The Saurus fan from they wardrobe
Cause only computer geeks think Saurus cold (source code)
He's like, "Scribble Jam! Scribble Jam! We freestyled it was raw it's impossible!"
That was just off beat dick jokes and more pre-meds than a volunteer hospital
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you ain't even gotta ask
Because it's hard to say no
Yea it's hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea you're all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea I'm all the way down we'll be fine
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you ain't even gotta ask
Because it's hard to say no
Yea it's hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea you're all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea I'm all the way down we'll be fine
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double you ain't even gotta ask
Because it's hard to say no
Yea it's hard to say no
Are you down are you down
Yea you're all the way down every time
Am i down am i down
Yea I'm all the way down we'll be fine
Manchmal frag ich mich, wieso ich immer noch rap
Ist wie Parfum sprühen über einen Kotzfleck
Auf deinem Lieblingspulli, doch er bleibt
Ich dachte Null wird mein bestes Album, doch, wer weiß
Vielleicht ist es der Anfang von was Großem
Oder das Ende von was kleinem, ich kann mich nicht entscheiden
Ich lieg um zwei Uhr nachts wach auf meiner Couch
Und denke: wann wachst du endlich auf?
"Schachmatt" - Schreit mir das Leben aus dem Nebenraum zu
Ich lenk es ab und stell meinen König schnell von E2 auf A8
Passanten fragen immer: "Markus, warum leuchtest du?"
Ich sage: "Ich gehöre nicht zu euch dazu"
Ich gebe mein Talent den Hunden zum Fraß
Mich auf, dich auch, kein Fick drauf
Ob meine Musik einer deiner hundert Kumpels mag
Ich nehm sie nur für dich auf, mich auch
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Eigentlich will ich gar nicht unbedingt erfolgreich sein
Doch umso älter ich werde, lässt man mich fühlen, ich sollte es sein
Naja, dann werd ichs halt
Manche sterben jung, manche sterben alt, manche sterben nie
Ich will meine Fresse nicht (nicht) unbedingt auf Titelblättern sehen
Mir reichts oft auch schon, wenn ich im Spiegel Maeckes seh
Muss es da auch noch auf dem Spiegel sein?
Ein ganz klares: ja! Bums, fallera
Stein für Stein stell ich auf, für mich ganz allein, ein ganz normaler Soziopath
Der sich freut, wenn möglichst viel vor allen Leuten zusammenfällt
Willkommen zu Maeckes-Dominotag
Manchmal denk ich, unser ganzes Leben ist 'ne Show von Mario Barth
Alle anderen amüsieren sich, ich nicht
Angesichts der Scheiße für die manche noch Eintritt zahlen
Heute schau ich mir ne Show von Maeckes an
Der Rest ist Barth
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Null ist das Tor in eine andere Welt
Uns egal, was allen anderen gefällt
Wir sind der singende und tanzende Abschaum der Welt
Jeder hat kaum noch Geld
Doch wir sind trotzdem drei mal so voll wie unser Kühlschrank
Und wir leuchten heller als der Rest mit ausgeglichenem Gemütszustand
Schließ die Augen, fühlst du es dann?
Wie du die Müdigkeit übermannst?
Die Füße im Sand, der Kopf im Smog
Obgleich du dachtest Null wird mein bestes Album, doch, wer weiß?
Ich gebe mein Talent den Hunden zum Fraß
Es langweilt sie, sie haben Zeit Ihres Lebens daran rumgenagt
Wenn ich mir den Kopf wegschieß, wachsen zwei neue nach
Ich feier meinen Erfolg im Grab
Zeit, dass ich weniger sag
Ich bin nicht Maeckes, nur sein chinesisches Plagiat
NULL!
Heute habe ich gemerkt, dass ich nicht perfekt bin
Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
...
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me (Got me)
I need you to-
So I keep my family close (Family close)
I keep my family close to me, I-I-I (I-I-I)
I keep my family close (I keep my family, I keep my family)
And we went whooped that nigga ass
He never respected me again
So that nigga goin' in
I'm gon' work
You live a double life and your mouth run like you get two lives
You're loose with it
You know my Startrax niggas, they produce with it
Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up (LIGHT UP!)
Wait until the sun goes down, we gon' make this
Bitch light up (LIGHT UP!)
Even when the sun goes down I'm a make it go
Where I don’t have be with you at all were what kind of man do you think that I am let you play with my heart, were she was at home all alone round by 4 in the morning and I gotta chance is go for it without no strings attach to your heart, then She waiting round for the phone to go off were I arrive at the door knock-knock so softly, were she came towards unlocked it an open then grab me by the Shirt
Verse2: there I having these Dreams bout Yo girl talkin to me seal the Deal with 3 bottles of Patron, were She was dancing like in Slow motion and seeing me everything wine down then I can’t witness were she teasing me so badly, where I want you to sign her like a Contract and She like the way she moving on up &down on this stick Im Lovin That Yo’ booty
Verse3: where Im wanna tie you down and playing rough with Yo Body in this Bed, were she looked back at me like that its whatever she wants said it don’t matter to me she screams like yeah, were she gets on top of me I get her from the back hit it from the side there’s ain't no stopping me she don’t want him she just want me
Verse4: where I told her Dim the lights on low jus turn on the stereo system take your Lingerie off leave on personal stereo, were she crawling for me with that Body and come sit close to me cause that’s how it’s supposed to be, were it’s late in the Evening then Freakiness’ has started and she drop it low ain’t tryna move fast baby let’s go but we gotta slow it down
This here's before the tip off, this is just the anthem/ before the fame, before the stage show ransoms/ I'll be demanding, for the chicks know I'm handsome/ just a ill artist on the mic but give my band some/ they tried to play me foul turned it to an and one/ crossover appeal guess that makes me The Answer/ A.I. while the push artificial intelligence/ I stay fly but I always remain a gentlemen/ and now my name got some relevance/ cuz I tackle issues and say it in a way they get/ use to play the bench but soon I'll pack stadiums/ cuz I detonate on MC's in blast radius/ I'm by myself but y'all just the Raptors/ so best believe you'll see my name in the raftors/ When its said and done, the game's chosen son/ shatter records, homie and I just begun
Chorus
I been balling for a while but nobody knew my name
But I'll tell you something real I'm the coldest in the game
Keep it true for the fans I ain't never gonna change
Get ya tickets now cuz I'm headed for the fame
8x Watch Me Ball
I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy
But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Tripping off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me
Chorus
That was that
So I can't be beefin' with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you livin' in a mansion in all your raps though
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though
Google Maps, though
That was that
So I can't be beefin' with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you livin' in a mansion in all your raps though
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though
That was that
So I can't be beefin' with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you livin' in a mansion in all your raps though
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though
Google Maps, though
That was that
So I can't be beefin' with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you livin' in a mansion in all your raps though
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though
That was that
So I can't be beefin' with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you livin' in a mansion in all your raps though

That was that
So I can't be beefin' with no wack nigga, got no backbone
Heard you livin' in a mansion in all your raps though
But your shit look like the trap on this Google Maps, though
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
'Cause ever since I left the city
You got a reputation on your own now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down
You got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city
You started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I’ve never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
'Cause ever since I left the city
Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the...
Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Muthafuck them other niggas be the state of mind
Got them haters on the job like it’s a 9 to 5
Getting money, mind ya business and stay out of mine
50 thousands for this rolly homie
I die tonight just bring my jewelry to the ceremony
Lord knows I be shittin’ on ‘em
Hottest nigga since that weather out in Arizona
Sleeping on me hope you choke and fall into a coma
Smell the frangrance know the money be the new aroma
I’m just spazzing out, denims carry large amounts
Got them bitches throwin’ pussy what the asses out
True story, new glory
Money stacking taller than a two story
Real niggas countin money, never gets boring
Last year I made a million of the state touring
Fuck boys, know what you talking bout
I run my own team, ain't no room for mascots
Look around, peep at the winners circle
We the niggas touching paper like a social worker
Plus them pistols keep them shells like a ninja turtle
Wear rubber, cus these Spanish bitches so fertile
Lord Knows I be going hard
RIP my nigga Daniel, remember that garage
Long nights, before that rap shit
I was thinking moving keys like a locksmith
No sir, the cops
Them crackers dirty, I just hope you keep ya name clear
Waiting for a nigga, trippin’ I just stand still
I ain't trippin’ I just stand still
Lord knows that I’m stressed out
Walking through these roadblocks with my chest out
Damn, 23 and made a million dollars
Fucking put a quarter million dollars round a collar
Couple more to cop a Phantom I ain't talking opera
They sya my flow sick I should see a fucking doctor
Real niggas in ya presence
Chopper raise a nigga head like you present
Broward County I am that
Only nigga in my city riding Maybach’s
Motivation, motivation, my niggas fans are dead
They only location?
And thats word to my daughter
I’m just tryna make it your headquarters
Word up
I love your sushi roll, Hotter than Wasabi
I race for your love, Shake and bake Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W but I can't meet you at the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back cuz I’m not just anybody
I see em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston, and let the rest surprise her
Cos when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh that was you girl, I thought I recognized her
Uh, She a'int got a man, but she is not alone
Miss Independent, yeah she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um uh I mean flawless
Well that's what you are, how I see it
Is how I call it, yeah
Look at how she walk
Mm hmm, she know she bad
Do your thing baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain't leavin fast, Imma stay awhile
Hold your head Chris, Imma Take Her Down
Have it my way, them bullets coming for your ass lik' tupe it's the superbowl
What would you do if I needed more cash, What would you do if I needed a bus pass, would say "Who me, get up and pay your fare" is that you walking or is that the money talking
Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art
You know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail
Got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me
When these bad bitches let go, well, girl, let's go
Walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth, I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you
Be you (Be you), yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown
It being going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention
I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place
Shit, I did all of that on my own, aw yeah
All I gotta do is put my mind to this shit
I like all my exes ...
24-hour champagne diet
Spilling while I'm sipping, I encourage you to try it
I'm probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it
The club owner supply it, boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow, oh
I-I'm on my Disney sh*t - Goofy flow
On records I'm Captain Hook and my new car is "Rufio"
Damn, where my roof just go? I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shaking something cause that's what Drumma produced it for
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for
Like leaving girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
Boy, I'm on that fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
That fly sh*t
I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow, oh
Yeah, JR, Songz
The guys want you
The girls want me
But what can we do
If I just keep it honest, promise you will be too
Cause you told me that everything I'm doings brand new
I watch you getting dressed
So just appreciate the view
They ask why I let her go out alone
I say I don't feel no pressure coz I know she's coming home
And my
Is home
So she's always tryna housie
Anything she puts on her body's the perfect outfit
I don't see the problem
If she wanna party
Put on sexy clothes and
Go and move her body
Shawty, my shawty she do what she please
Please, she's coming home with me
Put my county on my back let em know I'm real
Its somethin' I ain't gotta say they can feel
Never fade away from the real me, always keep it one hundred and always be me
They may change yeah, they may change, but I'm a always be the same, always be the same
They may change yeah, they may change, but I'm a always be the same, always be the same
Hope you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back
Lil Mel :
Never on my mind to change
I just stay the same
See my life image is plain
Now addin a frame
Do what I want for me
Overlooking the rest
I just express the truth
And hope for the best
I was taught to be independent
So me standing alone is not really nothing new
Moms told me grow up and make the right variety in life
Now I guess it’s about time I choose
I would love to see the faces of those who tried
Cuz like a new car in highschool they wantin a ride
But No wasn’t with me then not with me now
I see how money sure make em come around
But for now that’s just a dream I’m just hoping for
I wish could step right into fame like an open door
I hate that it’s my fault women lose connection
But I never chase girls so there no real affection
Family over all I stand by that statement
Success is in the air I inhale the greatness
I tell them liers to get use to my lateness
They need to realize themselves to differ the from fakeness
I hate it
Also im way pass judgement calls
I’m not the one to judge
And neither are you
So don’t tell me what you hear
Tell me what you know
If you paid attention to my lyrics tell me what you owe
If I ask you my name do you even know
And if ya dnt know now ya kno
Lil Mel
(HOOK)
Yeah
Look
I never been the type to take love
And never ever will I fake love
But maybe we can make love, yeah
I kinda like those things you do
You know I still got that thing for you
And maybe I can teach you a thing or two, yeah
And maybe we can touch a cloud
We might not make our parents prou
But, fuck it
Cause I be on some cool shit
But I ain't tryna prove shit
If you ain't tryna be down
Then we can just be cool, shit
Forreal though, like
We should leave it to the birds to hide
We might not make it to the other side
But tell me is you down to ride?
Cause they'll miss us, before we miss them
And they'll diss us, no matter what we give them
So like, fuck it
You down?
Or nah?
This is the quest
You are now on cloud number nine
Sometimes, I sit and wonder if it is what you say
You see, I know I got you feeling some kinda way
I'm trying to feel at home at that place that you stay
Or we can get it poppin' in some shit far away
I still feel like I'm on a quest for you
Getting dressed feeling like I'm getting dressed for you Opinionated but you make me digress for you
And I know you gotta do what's best for you
So I'm
On cloud nine
Up past my bedtime
No rest at the kingdom
I'm up in my zone but I'm not alone
All that I can think of is
We should get higher
We can get higher
Let's start rollin' up on this and let's get higher
Let's get higher
Let's get higher
Let's get higher (x2)
I just wanna say I'm yours, I'm yours
I just wanna say I'm yours, I'm yours
I know you think I'm playing
But I'm yours, I'm yours
I'm yours, I'm yours
I just wanna say I'm yours, I'm yours
I know you think I'm playing
But I'm yours, I'm yours
You see, I think it's dope that
We got two different minds
We got two different paths
And we on two different grinds
We got two different style
And stand on two different ceilings
But damn, some kinda way
We got identical feelings, it's like
I been through hell to get right where I am, and
You been through hell to get right where you are
I think it's meant to be that we're right where we are
So if you ever wander just don't wander too far
I'm still
But you wasn't really real
You ain't even really fuck with me
All this time passed and the shit still fucks with me
Got me thinking if the shit is what it's suppose to be
You said it was good but the shit just sucked to me
And you was just bad luck to me
Could have been the one
But you was just bad luck to me
Ayo
I'm the guy that's always tryna get high
And sometimes
I like to leave and be at one with the sky
And that's when
I get to thinking, damn another lonely night
Seem like love not for me
So I'm just loving my mic
I been through hell and back
Tryna fill this hole in my heart
And it fails, it just fails
And I'm just back at the start
My sanity then departs
And revenge is what I'm craving
Bodies dropping, steady plotting
Thinking 'bout assassination
As my guard gets stronger
Hit-list gets longer
Am I forever alone?
This the shit that I ponder
Are you out there in the world
Or did you already leave it?
If this is what love is
Then shit I don't really need it
So it's just back to the mic
And it's just back to the grind
No more opening up
No more wasting my time
Ima, ima be up here on a cloud
'Til I think it's time to re-up on the loud
Midnight on Cloud Nine
Yeah we kill and get te money
Hey nigga this is funy
I keep the bitches crazy but tonight I make em busy
The rap was there before I born Im hustling
Dont try to pour me water her is the warning danger zone
My lil niggas from Spain are smoking cocain
Big money big bank young nigga big stomach tomuch money I feed em more Im hustling
I was the soccer player now Imma fucking the world
Stamo Songz2
This is summer summer summer summer summer time
Each and every time I make sure that I make em dance
Never miss me baby if you get a chance
Im in the blue beach
Stamo make a change
You can't believe
2.4 is a million
In rands its a billion
Yeah
.
Thank you to love ex, Zumbarion, Shadyfan, Devanand Kate, Anoint Ngobeni for correcting these lyrics
(Sample: From Time by Drake featuring Jhené Aiko)
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you've been through more than most of us
I graduated but didn't attend the ceremony
Because the honour wasn't really much to cherish for me
Imagine being on stage with teeth barely showing
Stomach in chest out, with the camera's glowing
For a qualification you'll never glorify
More than getting excessive plays on Spotify
Or Soundcloud, around town they know the guy
The calling was too loud to nullify
A hundred times, I swear, I tried to deviate
And I was wishing that Modimo could just mediate
I broke down, no tow truck to see me straight
Psychologist saying that I'm in need of space
But I'm already lonely, though I'm hardly alone
On a journey I shouldn't be embarking alone
Pack of 10s and a 6 pack I party alone
Say hello to the real me I promised to show
Hi, nice to meet you
I'm hoping that we can connect as people
I'm learning with time to silence my ego
But, being humble don't mean that I can't be lethal
I'm killing you if I need to, I'm killing you if I need to
Your honesty can sometimes lead me on to a sequel
I'd probably be a nice guy if I wasn't so evil
Because I'm vulnerable the most whenever I'm living see through
Transparent it's hurting like I'm a homophobe
And 'fuck you' to all the homophobes
My cousin's the realest person I've ever known
And he was living gorgeous way before they invented phones
So get a load of this reality
For all the tough times that you battle in
A little bounce you can party to
And heres the needed magic to get you through all your Varsy Blues
.. Yes
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you've been through more than most of us
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love, call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know that hotline bling
Oh, and that could only mean one thing
Well, and I know that hotline bling
Oh, and that could only mean one thing
Boy, what do you mean?
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don't want me to leave, then you tell me to go
When you wanna turn right, when you wanna turn right
'Cause we argue all day, makin' love all night
Oh, what do you mean?
Oh, and where are you now? Oh
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For ever breaking your heart
But when I called, you'd never seem to be home...
So, why don't you call me on my cell phone?
Late night when you need my love, just call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know that hotline bling
Oh, and that could only mean one thing
Well, and I know that hotline bling
Oh, and that could only mean one thing
Boy, what do you mean?
Too Many Times, I've been wrong, takes-takes too long
Too many times, I've been wrong, I'm done waiting
Too Many Times, I've been wrong, takes-takes too long
Too many times, I've been wrong, I'm done waiting
There's nothing left to do
I thought you were my star
I thought with you we'd go far
But we weren't secured
Wellsfargo
What about the trouble we endured
How deeep are m bars gonna go
Sweet smell of misery
Everyday was a mystery
I guess that-I guess that I couldn't see through your wizardry
Too Many Times, I've been wrong, takes-takes too long
Too many times, I've been wrong, I'm done waiting
Too Many Times, I've been wrong, takes-takes too long
Too many times, I've been wrong, I'm done waiting
There's nothing left to do
I heard the sky is the limit, so I'm gon fly
Look boy I'm a man and I'm grown
Tryna make my money stretch like the city at home
The game is 90 percent biz, and 10 percent grinden
Got a team called Young Money, and the coach called Weezy timeless
Not sooner or later, but sooner than later
Born in September, I say it proudly
Ain't nothing but two middle fingers for those who doubt me
I ain't dead, but Imma shoot where the clouds be
Watch me as I
But I'll proceed to keep going until I'm filthy
Cause one of my niggas just faced the judge and found guilty
So Imma spread my wings, and Imma keep flying
And hope I don't freefall and dive in
Nigga like a
Yeah, alright
Look, like my big bro say I'm goin' in
Olympic pools of money I’m just glad I learned to swim Cannonball, bitch, I hope the divin' board's sturdy
And I hope when dinner's cold my niggas do not desert me
Ha, and these haters like damn 'em
I gave a lot of women they first ride in the Phantom
And yeah I got a deal now and I'm secure with it
And yet my life is so excitin' I get bored with it
I'm the best one outta my peers
And everybody pray I'm runnin' outta ideas
Pass my Moselys it's all so bright
And I'm the result of when it all goes right
So many pictures man the flow is a collage
Critics have a hard time pointin' out the flaws
All this slick talk, I just hope I don't fall
Right out of the sky through the roof of your garage
I'm a...

Why they telling me I can’t do it?
When they don’t know a fucking thing
They see happiness as something that the money brings
And I’m the dummy here that’s fumbling
I’m done with this/ me; I’m having none of it
Jumping out the thunder still I’m wondering
They hear my words but think of me as drunk I mean
Nothing I could conjure up would ever pick me up
I need something made of substance or I’ll always be kept underneath
And as much as I would love to be the one that cuts the leash
And lets you open up your minds and wander free
I just can’t/ used to think my father could
But if he failed then I don’t stand a fucking chance
I’m hearing stories of these people past their forties
Acting borderline mature and boy this shit’s just getting boring
So I’m calling just to call out this moronic kinda BS
And alleviate this stress/ I’m going all in ‘til I’ve poured it out
I’m not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I’m not new to this
Niggas wouldn’t make it on this side
I’m not new to this
I’m not new
I’m not new
Lord knows
He knows it better than you ever could
I’m feeling so unsettled
If you knew me well you’d know for sure
I never would attack you out of hate
In fact I feel I have to say I wrote this out of love
I’m only stepping foot in these territories
Simply ‘cause I’m sick of hearing everybody
Peddling their beefs and their opinions
Every second always talking him and her
And he did this and he got that and she got this and he knows her
You react in such a way that’s so confusing to me
‘Cause I grew up with you in my head as someone to look up to
Now I’m losing you/ believe me when I say I feel so stupid
Who could look up to some people hooked on beef
And just gossiping and frolicking in politics
And all of it’s just knocking on my head
This shit’s a problem
So I’m shooting just to hook you in
And help you out before I snap and have to look towards the hookah
Temper rising ‘cause I’m trapped inside this pressure cooker
Surrounded by these people I should break my neck to look up to
But every time I look up I don’t see a thing
So only place to look now is look down
And look at all these overgrown children
Hold in my emotion with an overdose building
Sober up and hoping for a colder soul
Still sit holding onto hope although I know it won’t kill this
Bullshit so I’m diving in this pool and going comatose
Ill shit/ my anger’s got this pen in my hand
Penning this banger as penance for any disrespect
I may have sent your way
Let me reassess my manners
But this ain’t no apology
I just feel uncomfortable
I’m airing out my family but still I feel I need to do it
Just to get this off my chest
I’m mad but see I love you still
I fucking will until my end
I’ll punch your grill from time to time
In the hope I let you know just how I fucking feel
Throw dirt on my state of mind/ no doubt it’s messy
Give a shout to Messi/ put me on this beat to beat it down
And show how deadly I can get if you were to ever send a hint
That you’d go out your way to just go disrespect me
‘Cause I can be as disrespectful as Fifty dissing Game and Buck
Or Shady taking ladies and their babies
And explaining how his chainsaw’s gonna wake ‘em up
It’s crazy how I use to be
Now usually I straight up question anyone that says some shit
That’s news to me/ I’ve grown up/ still see the world as beautiful
But thing is now I just don’t act as beautifully
And I feel like friend or fam I’ll end it now
This is who I grew into/ who gives a shit?
You knew me then/ try know me now
I hold my sound in ‘til I spit
Then I’m back to laying low
I’ll show you how
You get close
You sit back
Don’t get close
Then next step – stay mellow
And then what?
You get fucking used to me
Ha…
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Girl I know that it's been a minute
I'll take the night off for you
I swear tonight I'm gon spoil
Show you how much I adore you, yeah
You know all you gotta say is that you widdit
And I'm come and pay you a visit
Have you all covered in kisses
Back shots all over the kitchen
We treat the table like a mattress
Fallin all over the cabinets
Girl you know I'm selfish
And can't nobody have this, they can't have this
I know just what you want, you ain't gotta say it
It ain't hard to guess by your body language
I know you hella anxious bae
Cause you already naked baby
You know I
I know what to do widdit
Yeah I know what to do widdit
I know what to do widdit
(I know what to do widdit)
Said I know what to do widdit
Pullin off another nightshift
You been feeling kinda neglected
Studio got me sleepless
But I promise we both end up sleepin
Kinda person turns me on
Bout time we make it personal
Breakfast-in-the-morn-type vibes
Let me show you what this sex game like
Girl I know just what you want, you ain't gotta say it
It ain't hard to guess by your body language
I know you hella anxious bae
Cause you already naked
I know
I know what to do widdit
Just give it to me baby
I know what to do widdit
I know what to do widdit
I know what to do widdit
It's been like 5 months
And my ex still giving me hell
Bout that verse and shit
I just speak how I feel
You know keeping it real
The truth can really hurt some shit
I don't do too much talking
So don't be surprised
If I really start merking shit
Told you not be surprised
When I started merking shit
Lord please take the wheel
She just said that I'm famous
When I'm tryna stay humble
I can not drop the ball
They hoping that I fumble
Oh lord
I just made a play
You should see they face
Let me hit the Ickey Shuffle
After the touchdown
For the one time
Shoe box all the new money
So it can age well like Madonna
All my niggas focused on the future
Singing "fuck up some commas,"
She might be a sauna
But looks can really be deceiving
Mannn just look at Rihanna
This is no second chance, this right here's a letter
I was gonna send it later but now is better
It was set for delivery at graduation
I'll recite it now to clear my reputation
You think I'm lonely, Akon wants his girl back
But that's not the reason I wrote this rap
Me and you have definitely grown from that
I just want to break the ice, Titanic cracks
Want to say in many ways you inspire me
Handling your business like a boss, not employee
The way we cared for each, listened careful
Sacrificing time living now and not for later
This is something I gotta get off my chest
Even though we moved on I still hope for the best for you
I'm a guy who can keep his distance
But my respect for you is a truth I can't resist
Not often but when I do reminisce
It's on how we ran the world with an iron fist
On how you were protected by the walls you built
The way your mind was high above my cries of guilt
You stayed rational when I was a heartless wreck
Picked up the broken pieces like a skateboard deck
Worth it in the end the fights we fought
Even though the way it ended was not my thoughts
Appreciate your act of acceptance
The closure help my stance, my independence
You have this finesse that is under minded
By your willingness to keep everything aligned
Get what I'm saying? All your acts of kindness
Give sight to those who suffer blindness
The feeling now is mutual
Grew a goatee for someone that I used to, know
For sure you got my back still like plan b
When your name pops up it enlightens me
Knowing your heart is strong enough to carry on still
You singing voice enough to set off the fire drill
I'm getting trembles just by typing this out
I hope you realize who I'm talking about
I'm not wishing for us to be as one
I just hope you listen to this when your practice is done
Above it all I want to show you gratitude
Not many people can handle my attitude
Conversations sailed fluid with a ship afloat
We built on a conversation from Death Note
The night we walked down Bell Air
Had the street lights glisten glee from out of your hair
And when we talked again about a year ago
I knew our maturity was at a steady growth
While my thoughts for you are out in the open
I have a reassurance that nothing is broken
We'll never talk in the current world
But you'll stay in my heart as the one girl
That listened
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I have to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient and waited to long
But I woulda came back, but I woulda came back for you
Woulda came back, woulda came back
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
And you're so sad. It's too bad. I wish you could've had what I had
All my bitches crave the riches which they THINK I have
They don't understand that
My money comes slowly and steady
And only if everyone throws me some pennies
For all these recordings they don't even let me know about
Until it's like the day before
At like four in the morning; it's surely annoying
I'm sorry, but corny and boring MCs
Are, like, always the first who want so much for free
And they swear that they're special and act like I owe'em
And try to make me think I'm lucky to know'em
But I'm lucky mama didn't raise a dummy
And that I can play it cool when they act funny
Because, at the end of the day, I still need'em
To keep me from going insane, so I feed'em
BEATS... and beats, and beats, But, I ain't stupid; I tell them "I don't sell'em; I lease'em."
I let'em make a hit from my sh*t, then hit'em up for my cut, till the sh*t gets weak, son
So what're your thoughts on that?
What're your thoughts of my thoughts on wax?
If you think I'm wrong, nigga, SKIP this song
But, if you feel me, nigga, sing along
Hell yeah... hell yeah, hell yeah...
F*ckin' right... f*ckin' right, all right
And we say, "Hell yeah... hell yeah, hell yeah...
F*ckin' right... damn right, all right. (Yeah)
Nigga, what'chu want - new school or old school?
What the f*ck... you thought I couldn't do both, fool?
This whole hip-hop sh*t is a Cakewalk for me
So don't give me Reason to use ProTools
Most niggas got a lot of sh*t to go through
Before they get to me, and I don't even KNOW you
So, don't step outta line and get your whole crew shot
Bullets will heat up your stomach like soul food
Don't give me reason to go back to my old ways
I was herbin' niggas back in the old days
If they would ever try to come to me and act up
They got the top of their heads slapped. "Homie don't play... that."
Put a bullet in your wave cap
Push your finger-waves back, then grab your chick's ass
Make her gag on the dick, back and forth, quick-fast
Have her catch whiplash, then tell her to think fast
So what're your thoughts on that?
What're your thoughts of my thoughts on wax?
If you think I'm wrong, nigga, SKIP this song
But, if you feel me, nigga, sing along...
... Sh*t...
If you think I'm wrong, nigga, SKIP this song! But, if you feel me, nigga, sing along
Hell yeah... hell yeah, hell yeah...
F*ckin' right... f*ckin' right, all right
And we say, "Hell yeah... hell yeah, hell yeah...
F*ckin' right... damn right, all right. (Yeah)

Skip 1 to 99, dime by dime (Real fuckin Quick homie)
That's the real shit, this ain't a fuckin race
But you can bet your dough on the run, it's a paper chase
I'll scrape and strafe every tree or wood, a waste of space
There ain't gon be a trace of vapor, great landscapers ace
My fuckin nuts are bigger than the squirrels taking grapes
Making apes bananas enough to go whine and rape a steak
Or maybe fucking pussy, make the gape that ain't at stake
For Heaven's sake, and Jesus Christ Judicious fuckin faint
Faint mother fuckin bitch
Why?
And watch your mouth man, jeez
Sorry

You won't see me fucking faint, must be huffing paint
Stuffing taints, cunt punt a pussy's pussy, puffin dank
Cuffing skanks to the fence cuz the cuff yo chick thing made me poke
The joking clown holding frowns in, found him upped to roughing pranks
I thought I timed my rhymes from time to timing
The rhyming, dining in alive I'm driving
Surviving, I'm striving and thriving arriving
At the hide, the hive we on Vivran jiving
I go 0 to 100 brotha real quick
I'm not a hero or gunner but I still spit
Getting dinero you a runner but I'm real quick
Always from 0 to 100 and it's real fuckin quick homie
Slick homie it kills when your pockets are thick homie
It ain't shit if you spit like this homie
You bitch phony, whipped and stripped like a bitch pony
Tripped and get kicked in the ribs this is it homie
You slipped and I'm pissed so I flick my wrist only
As thick as the mist when I rip the piff, toe me
The jist of this shit when I mix the mix homie
The notes DO TI LA SO FA MI and flip DO RE
My prospective needs a prospectus, my concepts is electric
Conceptions eluding the rudest electives
Electoral selections, selective on erect consensus
Your senses sense what the cents is, the scent
That I sent the dentures, meant what I meant in the tent
The dent ventures, adventing inventions
For adventurous adventures, demented
As the dementia repents the sense to mention
Rubber band man, in dubs or vans man
Clubs in the crammed stands, thugs in Grand Ams
Snug as a bug in a rug on the drugs he can't stand
Candy land, white candy damn handy man
Knock knock this ain't a fuckin joke
Handful of mushrooms like the toad in Mario
Bro if you ask me why'd the chicken cross the road
I just went and fucked his chick cuz he owed me dough, bro
Damn
Who never been a heartbreaker, got a mind about it
Thought I had that, but I was wrong... lemme tell ya bout it
She was like my angel from way up above
She cried from the sky, she would shower me with love
Had her over every day, every single day I did
Started gettin careless, so next thing you know we made a kid
She was like mmm, I was like yess!
I hope we have a son, watch this nigga be the best
And right around june she took a plane & it was too late...
I did the math & found out her due date was...
Uh, this starts as my snipers hit they marks
And ya guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like clap, clap... let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let em all go
And most women are motivated, so I act accordingly
But this is so eshing that it means a lil more to me
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be
I provide protection if you open the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple "I think that were readys", couple "I think we should waits"
Are we actin like a couple? I'm just trynna get it straight
Cause I'm over here convinced that it's too early for mistakes & man...
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go?
I followed the rules & told ya everything ya had to know
Had ya over every night, every night was passionate
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident
Cause she was supposed to be my shawty, my baby
I put your life in front of mine because that's where you asked to be
Sayin I don't treat you the same, so now you askin me
Who cares chivarly, they need to get they sentencing
Meanwhile we arguin, & I can't get a sentence in
And just as I was hangin up the phone, she told me to hold on
Cause she's finally comin home in july...
She said, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly"
I only love my bed and my mama, I'm sorry
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they’ll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn that O2 into that O3
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies
God's plan, God’s plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't, yeah
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ay, don't
I finessed down Weston Road
Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin’
They wishin’ on me
God's Plan
You, you, you, you
You
Ever since I left the city, you
Cups of the rosé
Women in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
She's happy with a good guy
And I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say
Fuck that new guy that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that new guy that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around
I'm just sayin' you could do better
So tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
Yeah, cups of the XO
All my people been here
And she got all her friends here
She don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
And I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway, and say
Fuck that new guy that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that new guy that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around
I'm just sayin' you could do better
So tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking about women that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Women came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, 'cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
If this is how my story goes (turning pages)
What's its doing, nobody knows, but God
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal, and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
If this is how my story goes (turning pages)
What tomorrow has us doing, nobody knows, but God
Isn't it ironic?
Ain't it funny how sometimes we got our own plan
And life can just switch it up?
When life be dealing them losing hands
And leave you feeling like giving up
Sometimes it's hard to find a smile
Keep ya head up
Feel like it ain't gonna happen, no never
When defeat is not the magic door (it's hard to not open)
And the pain that you feel is hardcore
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
It's those memories of my sweetest, I was 15 when I started
Time flies, sometimes I feels like
It's happening for everybody but me
But I won't forget the promise I remember what he told me:
I hope that you can tell
I was only tryna get ahead
(I was only tryna get ahead)
If the spotlight makes you nervous
Don't you worry, don't you fear
Worries can't fill up your cares, ohhh
If you're looking for a purpose
Many plans in the minds of man, only God's purpose will stand, ohhh
I was only tryna get ahead
I was only tryna get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
It makes you nervous, woahhh, yeah
Uh, Versace remix you already know, whats good
Oh, she say I'm a sweeterman
But she say that she don't need a man
I say why don't we make an agreement then
We can just, while we being friends
Oh
Girl I know you wanna
I know you wanna, yeah
Party at the cribbo
Only wanted you here, not all of you friends though
In the feels so I'm never doing cheap shit
Doing what I can, I'mma show you that I mean shit
This ain't a love ballad, but I'm so dumb founded
Too much green, got too much salad
In the bong, feeling wrong, I just wanna be right though
Like I'm an iPhone fixing all the typos
Walking on a tightrope, will I fall down?
You can go Geico, but I'mma ball out
That 10% is like everything that I meant is like everything I gave is like everything I did
And if I never see a dollar then fuck it
Keeping with the rap like you kept me the comfort
Sometimes things are hot like an oven
But other times like I'm taking face full of knuckles
One, two, punch
I been up too much
I been stuck on you
I been fucked up drunk for a minute
I'm just kinda wondering if I can win it
Slurred words are still there
It's hurts but sure, you know that I still care
So I'mma pound these shots, these dudes pounce on thot
But my sights set, I might get, my one chance and (and, and)
Cups of the rosé

You're not gonna come?
Guess he's 'bout to just kick it here then

Her white friend said, "You niggas crazy"
He hopes no one heard that
He hopes no one heard that
‘Cause if they did, they gonna be in some trouble
They gonna be in some trouble, trouble

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city…
I think you're changin' your mind
Startin' to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise
And now I'd rather know ahead of time
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done
Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see you likin' someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done
I kept it decent, I kept you sane
I kept it peaceful, don't lie
I kept it decent, even the secrets
Kept it between you and I
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart
Breakin' me down when I'm already down
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea- brea
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezin' outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, oh
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
They keep telling me don't save you, if I ignore all that advice
Then something isn't right, then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

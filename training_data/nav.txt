Thirty pointers and up, Eliantte drippin', my whole team wet

When I'm sober I just don't like who I am
I remember being a kid, my teachers told me I wouldn't be shit
Diamonds in my pinky, look like water, make me seasick
Never had no help, so don't approach me on some free shit
Did this by myself, so why the fuck would I do a remix?
His bitch gave me top, don't want the pussy, he can keep it
Money and the power, fuck respect 'cause I don't need it
Drivin' to the west, I popped a bean and now I'm speedin'
Know some people in the 6 that dissed me for no reason
Sending shots, they sendin' shots, on road I never see them
Taking Ls, they takin' Ls, I never wanna be them
Got your bitch beside me, she just asked me what a bean is
Put her number in my phone, and you know I delete it

Everybody love me now, only you make me feel important
When we settle down, everything you buy gon' be imported
All of your friends, they told you, "Don't fuck with a artist"
When I tell you what my body count is, that gon hit you the hardest

Whenever they took my music for a joke
Whenever I ever had my back against the ropes
When I was down and out with no hope
She was always down from the get-go
She was always down, stayed ten toes
Lost my girl, found a thousand hoes
She a good girl, don't work on a pole
If I need it, she would stash my pole
She paid for all the dinners when I was broke
If I needed, she would hide my dope
Girl, I know you still wearing my clothes
I know you think about me when you're alone
I know you think about texting my phone

You wanna see me fail because I’m ballin'
You a fake and we ain’t got nothing in common
You didn’t pick up when you saw me callin'
So you wouldn’t catch me if you saw me fallin'
Be careful who you shit on, they might make it, you never know
Don’t try to come around me if you wasn’t here before
You say you need some tickets, wanna see me at my show
I put my bitch in VIP, I put you on the floor
I’m rolling off a bean and I’m stoned
I just did a interview with Rolling Stone
My teachers used to call my momma on the phone
I failed in all my classes, hated going home
Got-Got a lot of problems that I handle on my own
Remember making beats and feeling stuck inside my home
And now when I come home, I’m fucking every bitch I know
I just show my chain off to Lil Uzi on the phone

The ones who share a blood with me, the fakest people ever
I'm just trying to make it and they're wishing I would settle
You get a little money, thinkin' you worshipping the devil

You ain't drinking? I can't help you
Just cause I say I trust you that don't mean I don't doubt you
You wanna change your life you gotta change the people around you
I just fucked your bitch, she said "I'm so glad that I found you"

Either RAF or Ricky on my toes
In high school I never made the honor roll
Poppin' mollies, I've been on a roll
Hope the highway doesn't take a toll
Smokin' blunts, burn the seat in the Rolls

Woke up somewhere I ain't been before
Half a pill ain't enough anymore
They rappin' about drugs they never did before

Takin' full bars, I should really split 'em
Fell on my face, had to really quit 'em
My broski up north whippin' in the kitchen
My uncle just lost his kidney

When I had no hope you wasn't there
So when you ask for help, no I don't care
You say you can't pay your bills, no I don't care
I'ma go and spend your rent on underwear
I'm in Saks Fifth, used to shop at Sears
I've been poppin' pills and poppin' seals

They let a brown boy in the game and I'ma fuck it up
Nobody fucking with you, you should know you fucking up
Remember I was feeling down, now things are looking up
My pockets was so empty now them Franklins fill 'em up
Used to have a manager that was a jank
Cash found me I put gas in my Bentley tank
They had Body locked up holding on a shank
Now he cash out like he holding up the bank
I'm driving foreign whips, spent a hundred on my wrist
I might take your bitch, private flight, take a trip

Your bills be stacking up while I'm stacking up my chips
Your bitch on my dick, when she see me, want a flick
I fucked around and got my bands up
He see XO in the club, can't stand us
You better have your stick, can't stab or fight us
My team is solid and they can't divide us
I heard another opp just died, roll one and light up
You say that's your girl, then why she standing beside us?
Smoking so much blunts that I ran out of lighters
Me and mama used to cut the coupons out the flyers
She thought that her man was fly but now I'm flyer

His bitch isn't worth a penny, I can buy her
Doing burnouts in my 'Rari, spend his check on tires
Damn Daniel

I like the feeling of sand on my feet
So I brought a Draco to the beach
On my birthday she came home for me
Now I got her kids under my sheets
Brought her friend and she say she a freak
Now we bout to do something by the three
Fuckin' bitch after bitch
Got a sickness, I'm sick
I know your man isn't shit

Don't give any of these girls a kiss
Most likely I hit it and quit
You the only one that I miss
It just happened that I never quit
It just happened that I hit a lick
When I was with you girl I wasn't shit
It just happened that I turned out rich
Shopping, stoppin' I pose for a pic
It just happened that I bought Fendi kicks
It just happened that I fucked that bitch
It just happened that I thought with my dick

But you knew how I was from the start
Now I feel like we driftin' apart
When I celebrate you should be a part
I just got my first song on the charts
I just bought my momma a car
I turned my home boys into stars
When I'm shopping I fill up my cart
You should be wit' me
Ride or die Bobby and Whitney
Signed with XO and now none of these labels can pimp me
Now I'm getting the money so simply
I just hope that you miss me
I need you to trust me and believe in me (believe in me, believe in me)
I don't like taking chances, I like fucking hoes I already know
Gave into my thoughts, I can't ignore these voices anymore
Pendant flooded with rocks, I like it better when my neck is cold
Birdies by the flock, chasin' my crew everywhere we go
See them XO boys like, "There they go"
The money goin' where they go
Lifestyle so impeccable
Diss, we gon' turn you vegetable
Pillow-talking your business to these bitches, you ain't one of us
Bitch start blowin' me kisses when she heard me start my engine up
Ain't granting none of her wishes just because I got my money up
Got a big bag, you don't want smoke with us
Say you got money, you barely up
I'm givin' bitches pity fucks

We gon' shoot first and watch 'em duck
Been all in, I can call their bluff
Yeah, I done sold a lot of things but I would never sell my soul (My soul)
Diamonds biting and I got a Rollie yellow gold (It's gold)
I am not lying in the stories that I told
I ain't tryna fuck on a new bitch my bros don't know
Give into my thoughts, I can't ignore these voices any more
Pockets filled up with faces, I see dead people everywhere I go
Spend it but I work too hard just to waste it on a petty ho
Rockin' my closet, I can't tell you my favorite, I got plenty clothes
Got a big bag, got some bags of dope
I don't do it myself, but I got some coke

These other girls, they can't do nothin' for me
Girl, I need you here, I need some company
Dollars never disappear, ho
Why so serious?
These niggas, they make me sick, I'm about to throw up
Nigga, better hide yo' bitch, if you see us, roll up
Say you gettin' money, you better show us
Livin' like kings, these niggas is jokers
Jokers, jokers, jokers, jokers
Coupe all black like the Batmobile
These niggas is jokers, jokers, jokers
Try and take my chain, my niggas gone have them pistols smokin'
She drink, and she smoke, and she fuck, she the life of the party
The pimpin' is oh so ice cold, see the ice on my body
That's my kinda shawty, addicted to me, I'm her liquor, her weed
The marble look right in my lobby, count a hundred bands tonight
We hustle, stuff it in a duffel, uh that Samsonite
Gucci high tops on cold man, go sherbet
Young Bruce Wayne in the Batmobile, go skrrt, skrrt
Catch a breath, let her catch a breath
Twenty-four hour, make twenty-four grand
Fresh Prince, and I'm shinin' like night life lately
Vanilla the diamonds, like "Ice Ice Baby"
The whip that I'm drivin', like white rice and gravy
Your bitches, I'm robbin, they givin' like Mike Tyson lady
Forgets it, Porsche from a Lexus
Watch these bitches, and these bitches watch this fuckin' necklace
What a beautiful purchase, trust me my goonies are lurkin'
You movin’ too fast, hold up, shawty
Sippin' lean, I'm tryna’ slow up, shawty
I'm losing it
My heart is beatin', gotta roll one, shawty
I swear after tonight, I’m done with Molly
Just one more bean
I'ma pop one more bean
Just one more
I pop another Molly for no reason
I’m poured up and I'm leanin'
I call my homie, tell him sorry that I dissed him
Only if you knew what's in my system
All these bitches say they gettin' sick of me
I’m not myself, the drugs is takin' over me
You gotta understand my life ain't how it's supposed to be
I wanna be rich and havin' ice all over me
My heart is beatin', gotta roll one, shawty
I swear after tonight, I’m done with Molly
I'm poured up, I'm poured up
And I'm leanin', and I'm leanin'
Chasin' bags, I'm chasin' bags
And I'm chasin' bags, I'm chasin' bags
I'm poured up
Check my little pocket, what you need? I got it
Got bitches waitin' in the Four Seasons lobby
Said she got a boyfriend but at least she bein' honest
I've fucked some strippers but I never been a onyx
I've fucked some models but I don't look like a model
I've fucked a gold digger but I never spent a dollar
When I fly out to the Rex they shit themselves when I come back
Said she love me had to tell her, "Baby, stop it"
I see it, like it, if I want it then I cop it
Told Bucksy if I die put act inside my coffin
That bitch makin' a mess she fuckin' with the opps (With the opps)
Call up my shooter, he gon' clean up with a mop (With a mop)
Me and Trav feel stuck, we sippin' lean on the rocks (On the rocks)
Got two hundreds and they tucked in, we ain't stop (We ain't stop)
That bitch makin', a mess she fuckin' with the opps (With the opps)
I was at your block, and then you self-portrayed me
By the time we broke up, she told me where she met me
She was fuckin' with the opps, knowin' that they hate me
I fell in love with a thot, she wants to one me
Ayy, I know all the shooters plug, they with the mall (Woah, woah)
My chain light up like a closet to the wall (Woah, woah)
The 6 told me that I'm gonna get 'em all
At sixteen, I knew what I wanna be
The clip hold a .60, don't try runnin' up on me (Yeah)
Remember back when I was broke and I was wildin'
I'ma sign some paperwork and make five hundred thousand
New Patek, a hundred thousand
Two pints of Act', eleven thousand
Fucked a hundred bitches, next year I'ma fuck a thousand
Used to smoke ten grams a month and now I smoke a thousand
My outfit cost like four thousand
I just gave my mama thirty thousand
I'ma sign some paperwork and make five hundred thousand
New Patek, a hundred thousand
Two pints of Act', eleven thousand
I sign some paperwork and make five hundred thousand
...
I  think I'm an addict (Woo, woo)
Try to talk me down and I won't have it (Woo)
Lookin' for a thrill, I'm pull up to your party (I'ma pull up)
Mixin'  up the drank, mix the Percy with the Molly
Fuck poppin' bottles, I would rather pop a seal
I  got too much money, I don't know which drugs that I want
My problems in the past now
These bitches wanna hit me up 'cause they know I got cash now
You wanna know what money look like
But have you seen me, nigga?
Thousand dollar shoes, have you seen these, nigga?

These bitches wanna hit me up 'cause they know I got cash now
You wanna know what money look like

Made lots of income, got me comin' out...
When I was down and out, these niggas didn't wanna fuck with me
So when you see me now, my nigga, don't help me up
I got my double cup and it's filled up with promethazine
You wanna call me now 'cause I got my money up
Try to fuck with me, fuck with me
If you didn't fuck with me then, don't try to fuck with me now
Don't try to call me, don't try to follow me and message
All this money got these niggas stressin' now
So when you see me now, my nigga, don't help me up
I got my double cup and it's filled up with promethazine
Yo' bitch looking and I think she a flirt
Owls inside my shoes and Owls on my shirt
I'm staying clean, while my squad doing dirt
My diamonds is water, I'm smoking on Earth
When the check come in, she seein' it first
Buying a house, I'ma buy her a purse
I found myself a señorita down in Cali
I know some white girl sniffing coke up in the Valley
I told her "I just wanna fuck, girl", I don't need her
Mustard on the beat, ho
Ever since Tap-Tap-Tap, I feel like the brown boy back-back-back (I'm back)
Prada shoes with the strap, in every color, I'm proud of that (Proud of that)
Take my chain, watch the news next week, you gon' see dead bodies turnin' up (Bah, bah)
Poppin' this molly got me grindin' at night, got some porcelain teeth, then I fucked 'em up (Fucked 'em up)

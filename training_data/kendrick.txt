Nobody pray for me
It's been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know
Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol’ up, lil’, hol' up, lil’ bitch)
Be humble (Hol' up, bitch)

Bitch, sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (Lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Who that nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all
Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (Hol' up, bitch)

Sit down (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar (Uh)
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Uh)
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all—duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!—
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?
M.A.A.d city
Compton
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

K’s Mom: Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren’t gonna be back here on time anyways. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man. This man is on one, he feelin' good as a motherfucker. Shit, I’m tryna get my thing goin', too. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feelin' good. Look, listen to him!
K’s Dad: Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol’ fat ass. Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol’ fat ass
K’s Mom: See, he high as hell. Shit, and he ain’t even trippin' off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back!
K’s Dad: Did somebody say dominoes?
Throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you somethin', whoa
I'll chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin', I'll chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin', I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!," X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (No mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me?
It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back—
Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me) Damn!
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us!
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets
Wall Street, corporate offices
Banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll ask again—oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
Come on, we finna roll out!
Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast
I want to press my like, yeah, I wanna press my
I want a green light, I wanna be like
I wanna press my line, yeah
I wanna take that ride, yeah
I'm gonna press my line
I want a green light, I wanna be like, I wanna press my—
Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm relivin' moments, peeling more residual
(I can) buy the building, burn the building
Take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more
(I can) justify my love for you
And touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal (Ayy)
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard
The diamonds yours, the coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (Brr)
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
"I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem."
"Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?"
"Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry."
"Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?"
"Enough with all this talkin'."
"Matter of fact, get out the van, homie! Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!"
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', "Compton!"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?

We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?

Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Damn, love or lust
Damn, all of us
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still love me?
If I made up my mind at work, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I’d rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you, I got nothin' (Uh, uh)
Ayy, I got somethin'
Hol' up, we gon' function, ayy, no assumptions, ayy
Feelin' like Tyson with it
Knock it out twice, I’m with it
Only for the night, I’m kiddin'
Only for life, yeah, only for life, yeah
Only for life, let’s get it
Hit that shoulder lean
I know what comin' over me
Backstroke oversea
I know what you need
Already on ten, all money come in
All feeling go out, this feeling don't drought
This party won't end
If I didn’t ride blade on curb, would you still love me?
If I minimized my net-worth, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you, I got nothin' (Uh, uh)
I'm on the way
We ain't got no time to waste
Poppin' your gum on the way (love me)
Am I in the way?
I don't wan' pressure you none
I want your blessing today (love me)
Oh, by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way (love me)
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me, babe
Dammit, we jammin'
Bad attitude from yo' nanny
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like a exit away, yep
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still love me?
If I minimized my net-worth, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you, I got nothin' (Uh, uh)
Uh, Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I feel amazin', damn, I'm in the Matrix
My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin'
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screamin'—
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum and posin'
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and—
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or, nigga, it's go time
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you goin' marry mines."
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! No way
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! Okay
I'm never livin' life confined
As I feel you even if I'm blind
I can tell you who, what, when, where
How to sell your game right on time
Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! Go play
Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! I look like OJ
Killin' everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbin' in the street, yellin'—
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
Let it run, Ali
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, "Yah!"
Bad trips like, "Yah!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma come in heaven
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
I want everything black (We don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black
Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm caught in my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!
Miss me with that bullshit (Bullshit)
You ain't really wild, you a tourist (A tourist)
I be blackin' out with the purist (The purist)
I made a hundred thou', then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I made 500 thou', then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I bought a '87 for the weekend (The weekend)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (What you want)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (What you want)
Yeah, miss me with that bullshit (Bullshit)
You ain't really wild, you a tourist (A tourist)
I be blackin' out with the purist (The purist)
I made a hundred thou', then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I made 500 thou', then I freaked it (I freaked it)
I bought a '87 for the weekend (The weekend)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (What you want)
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want (What you want)
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like
We like fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria
But I don't see it, I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic
Tapped in when I'm maxed in Comp-Town with the MAC-10s
And the pumps in the background I was absent
Never OG, standout, I was lackin'
Everything else, but doubt in the Magnum
Holdin' Magnums with a Magnum
Nigga, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Bùyào, bùyào"
(Yeah, God)
Tee off the day, know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, "Off ya head"
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Fuck integrity, fuck your pedigree, fuck your feelings, fuck your culture
Fuck your moral, fuck your family, fuck your tribe
Fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars

I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit

My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch, all my grandmas dead

Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my Telegram like, "Be cautious!"

I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
Seven figures ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go, yeah, I go, yeah
They never been ready, yeah, I know, yeah, know, yeah
100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow, yeah, the flow, yeah
Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at they laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
Damned if I do, if I don't (Yuh)
Goddamn us all if you won't (Yuh)
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't front in line, get out the goddamn way
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust (All we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millennium
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I’m a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (Yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (Yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't vibe
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't vibe
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering "Get 'em!"
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told"
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
(On the phone)
"Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?"
"Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!"
"Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga."
"Al- alright, nigga-- nigga just come-- alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back."
"Arghh... Fuck!
So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?"
"Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now"
"Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"
Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst
How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst
What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst
Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say "fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say "See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works."
Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
"Lord God, I come to You a sinner."
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
"And I humbly repent for my sins."
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
"I believe that Jesus is Lord."
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
"I believe you raised Him from the dead."
(I believe you raised Him from the dead)
"I would ask that Jesus come into my life."
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
"And be my Lord and Savior."
(And be my Lord and Savior)
"I receive Jesus to take control of my life."
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
"And that I may live for Him from this day forward."
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
"Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood."
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
"In Jesus' name, amen."
(In Jesus' name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life – your REAL life
Hold up, biatch! This yo' favorite song
Translation: Ven aqui, mami, ese culo
Tu quieres coger mis huevos, y papi me molestes
Pero chuparse puto pendejo, el pinche cabron
Let's get it – nights like this, I'm a knight like this
Sword in my hand, I fight like this
And I'm more than a man, I'm a god
Bitch, touché, en garde
Toupée drop and her two tits pop
Out of that tank top and bra
And when I say "Doo-doo, doo-doo," bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this
I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, on forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down
Alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics poppin' out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steerin', ah!
Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)
Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody...
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
(One two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
Kendrick Lamar, make some noise, brother
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time
They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile-
And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated—
All ya'll come to the front, ya'll come up to the front
(I love myself)
Baby what about you, come on
(Crazy, what you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga
(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
Huh (Walk my bare feet) Huh (Walk my bare feet)
Huh (Down, down valley deep) Huh (Down, down valley deep)
(I love myself) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum)
(I love myself) Huh (My heart undone) one, two, three
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body...
(Offstage Argument)
Not on my, not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids bro
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim dog
Niggas ain't trying to play vic— TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?
No for real, answer the que—, how many niggas we done lost bro?
This—, this year alone
Exactly, so we ain't got time to waste time my nigga
Niggas gotta make time bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time right?
The judge make time so it ain’t shit
It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog
On the dead homies, Charlie P, you know that bro
You know that
It’s mando, right, it's mando
And I— And I say this because I love you niggas man
I love all my niggas bro
Exac— enough said, enough said
And we gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen, listen to this:
I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said, "Think about what you saying: "Fuck niggas"
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats"
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive
Uh-uh, fuck that (fuck that)
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
I hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he felt today
You know, when you part of Section.80
And you feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party, trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see
Is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)
And then she started…
And then she started feelin' herself
Like no one else in this apartment
"Beg your pardon?" "Oh, I rap, baby."
"How old are you?", She say 22, I say 23
"Okay, then we are crack babies."
"Damn, why you say that?" She said, "Where my drink at?"
"I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax."
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside
Then she said, "Read between the lines."
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown her body and I know
The both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me, then looked at it
And then she grabbed it, then she said, "Get it understood."
"You know why we crack babies?
Because we born in the '80s, that A.D.H.D crazy."
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, "Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards"
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, "K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy"
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the mornin' to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughin'
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, actin'
Fuckin' on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(… lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
I beat yo’ ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan—
(one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that—
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest?
Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say;
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga—
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
That’s not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben’s Island analysing; that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy’s Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth a bit—pause
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y’all
It’s respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it’s Michael Jackson—oh
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us "Billie Jean," you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga
"I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man
Maybe I’m just another nigga”
Shit and that’s all I wrote
I was gonna call it "Another Nigga" but, it ain’t really a poem
I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
What you mean by that, what the ground represent?
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
That’s how I see it, my word is bond
I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
Right
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry
Right
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be...
There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-
They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?
Aight so let me ask you this then
Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich
Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?
I see myself as a natural born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin’, I took the opportunities
I worked at the most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody managing me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
I changed everything, I realized my destiny
In a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying?
I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people
Now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying?
I made millions for the record companies
I made millions for these movie companies
Now I make millions for, for us
And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
By my faith in God, by my faith in the game
And by my faith in "all good things come to those that stay true"
Right
You know what I’m saying?
And it was happening to me for a reason
You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
So it’s no problem, you know
I mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know
I’m finna go straight through
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance
And not only me but, it goes down my family tree
You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back
Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
"We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win
And I wanna lay it all down"
In this country, a black man only have like
5 years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn 30 it’s like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a black man, in this country
And you don’t wanna fight no more
And if you don’t believe me, you can look around
You don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers
That’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings
Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that
There’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you
What you think is the future for me and my generation today?
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed
For real, I don’t think America know that
I think America think we was just playing
And it’s gonna be some more playing but
It ain’t gonna be no playing
It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying?
It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen
That’s crazy, man, in my opinion
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
Lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic
And I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out
Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes
Because it's spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
Damn
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It’s actually something a good friend had wrote
Describing my world, it says:
“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
In order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment
The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
But praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness
And the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life
The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
Which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He’s trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as
Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same"
What’s your perspective on that?
Pac? Pac? Pac?!
Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship
Candy-coated, my day shift's
Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up, lampin' in Jamaica
The clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin’
Burnin’ castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin'
This seed in this soil is classified
I’m satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
The more blood pours, but—
Don’t tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
My fans can't wait for me to son ya punk-ass
And crush ya whole lil' shit
I'll Big Pun ya punk-ass, you a scared lil' bitch
Tiptoein' around my name, nigga, you lame
And when I get at you, homie
Don't you just tell me you was just playin'
Oh, I was just playin', K-Dot
C'mon, you know a nigga rock with you, bro
Shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga I know
Might end up like the last nigga I know
Oh, you don't wanna clash? Nigga, I know
I put my foot on the gas, head on the floor
Hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, I'm on a roll
Yellin', "One, two, three, four, five
I am the greatest rapper alive"
So damn great, motherfucker, I've died
What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
House on the hill, house on the beach, nigga (facts)
A condo in Compton, I'm still in reach, nigga (facts)
I'm fresh out the water, I'm 'bout to breach, nigga
The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah, mo' cars, mo' lears
Mo' bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck y'all, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers
You know what the risk is
Earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness
The whole world gone mad
Bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash
Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump
Know how we feel, punk—tell him that God comin'
And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
It's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me?
I prophesized on my last song, you laughed at me
But when the shit get brackin', don't you ask for me
How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
G Malone, big bro, kudos to him
I was two O's from a M, tryna be big as Em
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits
You lookin' at me in Chucks, I'm lookin' at y'all suits
Me and Top Dawg playin' rock-paper-scissors in court
A real hustler lose money just to go get some more
I said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back
'Nother classic, right back
My next album, the whole industry on a ice pack
With TOC, you see the flames
In my E-Y-E's—it's not a game
And the whole world is goin' mad, daddy, it's sad, daddy
My only advice? Go and get you a bag, daddy
Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer
Beatin' up on my niggas while the CO's watch him
Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
You jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet Westbrook
Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
Just know, the next game played I might slap the shit out you
Technical foul, I'm flagrant, I'm foul
They throwin' me out, you throw in the towel
Look at the crowd, they— (Naw, I don't like that)
Look at my smile, I'm smirkin'
Calm but urgent (That ain't the style, fuck!)
So many verses, you live in denial (Fuck!)
So many verses, I never run out (What?)
You makin' him nervous, the music is loud
Ho, JAY-Z Hall of Fame, sit yo punk-ass down!
(Sit yo punk-ass down)
So that means you ain't bigger than rapping (What else?)
So that means no more playin' the back scenes (What else?)
My spot is solidified if you ask me (What else?)
My name is identified as "That King"
I'll let y'all worry about a list, I'm on some other shit
A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together
Let's get it!
Look, look!
On foenem
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Chunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that
At first, I did love you (Love you)
But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)
Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)
Until I get my nut ('Til I get my nut)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, "Fuck your haters"
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five
*Screaming*
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of one-hunnid-thousand but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need ya!
The world don't need ya, don't let them deceive ya
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear—
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too
Are you the reason why mom and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he'd recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed," you ain't try
*Sniffling*
I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk *gulping*
I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world
About that shit you thinkin' and that time you *gulping*, I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass long time ago
You should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if these mirrors could talk it'd say, "You gotta go"
And if I told your secrets the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch
Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like "doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still "nigga, what is you sayin'?"
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want
Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: "Hello? What you doin'?" — "Kickin' it."
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!
We finna get active!
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
Maybe I wasn’t there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Wait, hol' up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlookin' every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like I'm about to break a levee
Hol' up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and Mick Romney!
I’m grown now, I’m on my own now
I’m po-o-o-oppin'
Change my phone now when I get home now
I got o-o-o-options
Fast forward, wait, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies
Same car note that’s overdue? I know
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

So, I was takin' a walk the other day…
Alright, here we go, third take
Real quick, Ali, mm
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yessir (Amen!) Church
(He dead!) I killed him (Amen!) Bitch
And this is rigor mortis, and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded, and I'm Morpheus; the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit, then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead! Amen!) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrities, this is studio felony
Ferragami, so many, and cool enough for the '70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch you been living in debt with me
Dead 'em all, and especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
That say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling? That's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q
Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I killed him
(He dead!) Hmh, hmh, hm (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
I rapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster?
Your hypocritesque reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased
I'm persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the street
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
Of y'all fucks never could hassle me
And y'all luck just ran out, you'll see
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something, or die in the morning
Section.80, HiiiPoWeR
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard
He probly clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on the field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Tryna be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy, product of the late 80's
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
Thug Life! Thug Life!
Dick hard like rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo
The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won’t mention my 10,000 hours in training
While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y’all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We here to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I’m the one
This is vintage from 1980 somethin'
I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I’m in the White House going all out
Bumping College Dropout, God bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
Whoa
Burnin’ my leather-
(Nah I’m just fuckin’ wit cha)
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
"20 on pump 6," dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
"20 on 6," he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it"
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more"
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me; how much a dollar cost?
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
"Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need"
Tell me; how much a dollar cost?
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God"
Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (Head)
Head, head, and more head (Head)
Oh God, bless the dead (Yah)
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same
(Woman moaning)
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk-
Sex
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em
I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
Ayy, I am the truth
Ayy, I am the wisdom of the fallen; I'm the youth
Ayy, I am the greatest
Ayy, this is the proof
Ayy, I work hard, pray hard, pay dues, ayy
I transform with pressure, I'm hands-on with effort
I fell twice before, my bounce back was special
Letdowns'll get you, and the critics'll test you
But the strong'll survive, another scar may bless you, ah
Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you taught me to
Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you taught me to
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA
Uhh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch
Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
"Ribbon In The Sky" on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
'Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessy and, for my niggas, OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy, he's on his job
Boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life, controlling my price?
No way, hell no, uh-uh
If I'm wrong, I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA
They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah, my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand-me-downs
See if you fuck, then it's after me
You know how much I'ma make it work?
You know her dress livin' in her purse
When you discuss your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first: Cali
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather

From all around the world for the women, weed and weather

Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA
K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
Every time I call, it's going to voicemail
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga?
No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha
Call me on Shaniqua's phone!
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
My lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies
Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called and said, "the enemies done cliqued up"
Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas names on paper, you snitched all summer
Streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, set trippin’ all around
Ain't nothin' new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo-
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
Back in the city
I was entering a new one
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
I told that bitch, "I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick."
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me—fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day." (*Phone hangs up*) Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', "I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasin' her"
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the—
(She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more)
(She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more)
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
And I told her, "Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
(Ain't nobody prayin' for me)
(Ain't nobody prayin' for me)
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
(Nobody prayin' for me)
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
(Ain't nobody prayin' for me)
(Nobody prayin' for me)
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin'
I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'
Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that You raised him from the dead
I would ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, amen
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello, my name is Kendrick," she said, "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
"Where you stay?" She said, "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well, is it Compton?" "No," she replied
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, "What you tryna get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
"I wanna come over, what's up?"
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang
Please leave your message for three-two-three
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn, I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes
Man, I gotta go up to the county buildin', man, these kids ready to eat
I'm ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on your way or what?
I hope you ain't out there messin' with them damn hoodrats out there, shit
'Specially that lil' crazy-ass girl Sherane
And plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain't gon' pass to the next grade
Eleventh grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Your daddy callin' about some damn dominoes (Let me holler at him)
He want to holler at you too, go ahead, Kenny, go'n, shit
Hello? Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
(Kenny), What?
I'm on his voicemail, damn fool (Oh), shit
Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I asked you to bring my fuckin' dominoes
Just give me the damn phone, shit, don't hang up, damn, let me
Kendrick, when you get this message, man, call me back (Keep losin' my goddamn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard)
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car (And squab, homie)
This man fussin' 'bout some damn dominoes
It ain't all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment, fuck
Fuck some damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
Nobody wanna hear your ass
Matter fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on
You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe
I need some water, somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's, I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much? Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that, girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch, let me put the head in
If it's okay, she said, "It's okay"
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy—hol' up!
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count
I need some water, somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's, I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much? Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that, girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch, let me put the head in
If it's okay, she said, "It's okay"
I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust
Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction
Lately, I'm not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours
I need some water, somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's, I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much? Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that, girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch, let me put the head in
If it's okay, she said, "It's okay"
Pimp-pimp (Hooray)
Pimp-pimp (Hooray)
(Hooray)
Pimp-pimp (Hooray)
Pimp-pimp
I'm sick and tired of being tired
Can't pick a side, the Gemini
Prophesize if we live or not
Promise momma not to fear nobody
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?
Get God on the phone, said it won't be long
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy, where did we go wrong?
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone, tell the squad come home
We gon' ball again 'fore he call us home
World is going brazy, where did we go wrong?
It's a tidal wave, it's a thunderdome
Get God on the phone
I just got a raise (I just got a raise)
Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me)
Diamonds all appraised (Diamonds all appraised)
And I'm bossing up (And I'm bossing up)
Bitch, get out the way (Bitch, get out the way)
I'm the only way, we can fornicate
Ah, pimping and posing, look what I drove in, ah
Having these hoes and I know that I'm chosen, ah
I live by the code and me and my bros and, ah
My dollars ain't foldin', you was never the homie
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?
Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone
(What's up, my nigga?)
Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards, triple digits
Parallel park like an alien came visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick
(Hello, Billy)
So many plays, homie, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 911
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm 'bout to let my hair down on hoes
Top billin', that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two, I'm not done
2Teez told me that I'm the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
What is like twenty-five hundred a month?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch, I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me, come here now, lil' baby
I'm fuckin, I'm crazy
Serving it like I belong in the basement
Or live at the Days Inn
Yan Yan my relative, black cherry soda
Pistol and poverty, come get to know us
(Get Top on the phone)
Who doing the drums?
Man put that nigga on the drums man
Yep, all day, "Mortal Man" and "Kunta"
Alright, from the top
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Bitches come and go (You know that)
Money come and go (You know that)
Love come and go (Don't shit last)
Me and my bitch, took a little trip

Bitches come and go (You know that)

I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Hol' up
Trinidad Jame$ in four weeks
But now my album platinum and shit, so what?
Y'all keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
This courtesy of Compton (Courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like "wait"
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher
But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe
Pipe down, on the curb, when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon, that's excellent (That's excellent)
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation by far
Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16
That I'd write a 16 to put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Should have been in the pen
But now my pen write with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life
But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga, you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by (Doot!)
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
I am the bad, the good God, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10 second drum solo
Bitch see you at Woodstock, ah!
I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close—get money, fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My momma told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read—
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece, she worth livin'
See me on the TV and scream: "That's Uncle Kendrick!"
Yeah, that's the business (Uno)
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite, don't call me black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth
Said know my worth
And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed
I know He walks the Earth
But it's money to get, bitches to hit, yah
Zeroes to flip, temptation is, yah
First on my list, I can't resist, yah
Everyone together now, know that we forever—
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that's what it gotta be
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own
This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Ever since a young man (Since a young man)
All I wanna be was a gunman (Was a gunman)
Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT
I'm sellin' verses, JT, watch me work it, JT
Look, look… hol' up!
Don't judge me! My mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me! I was young, fuckin' all the brats
Don't judge me! Aimin’ at your head for a stack
Don’t judge! Don't judge me! Now my home got a Valley peak
Don’t judge me! If I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me! Won't you tell a friend? Y'all gon’ see—
This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Fuck is you talkin' to?
Ayy, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel
I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Asked for a piece of mind, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous
This what God feel like
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
This what God feel like
Oh, hey
Oh, oh hey
Oh, oh, oh hey
Uh oh, uh oh
No more “please stop”
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa
Oh hey
Oh, oh hey
Oh, oh, oh hey
Uh oh, uh oh
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pit bull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick ain't free
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say "Queen"
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like "because"
Or the word "but," but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me "ball out"?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone)
Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates, break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all
So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
"Hello ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it."
She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something
You've lost… your life."
{Gunshot}
I wanna hit line drives…
Wanna lose weight and keep eating…
For you…
Hey, whats up doc?
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
Ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
That's ironic (Y-Yeah! Blow!)
Ironic (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Y-Yeah! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic
Liberation… Leader…
Popular pie plant pictured here…
Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!
This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun
How come your tongue say, "killa" then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I'm from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you a nun do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
That's a error, you can smell it in the air
And everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
All y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
Cartoons and (Cereal!) I ain't felt this (Good since!)
Scrooge McDuck (Here we go!), elementary hood shit
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"

That's ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
Ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
That's ironic (Y-Yeah! Blow!)
Ironic (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth

And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Y-Yeah! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic
This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
Even with a pot to piss in
I'ma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
Emerging on everbody corner (Dash for it)
Get a toe tag when you play tag
With a task of a new (Task force)
Everybody wanna know my life
How did I make it (Past yours)
Well let me tell you like this
I've been running this shit since I (Asked for)
Cartoons and cereal
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room
And I run it
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?
Life to me, like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me
"Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards"
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...
Tell me find your spot with the warning that I might slip
And when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip
Ride on me like your Pac got me thinkin' it's 96'
I can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
I'm so hip to it, tourists want to come speculate
But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
And, yeah, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me
I'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
We gon' fuck around (Mmm), we gon' fuck around
And triple through triplets of babies right now
And that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile
That means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection
I find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored
We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
Then I wish you good luck on the seats thats inside this Porsche
Shine like blood diamonds
Learning to have patience only cause you are timeless
The universe energy doesn't lie
And this chemistry is infinity at a million times
I wrote a million rhymes describing your star power
And after 24 bars, you get 24 hours
I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that? (remember that?)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with, ayy
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with
Big shot (hol' up, wait)
Peanut butter insides
(No) Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Rule of the day, get a view every day
Get a bitch with a tan by the pool every day
Get a clip with a plan, give a jewel every day
I never sleep, I gotta eat, I gotta dance
I Milly Rock when I get that advance
How can I shop with like 64 Ms?
Talkin' to Top about business again
He want a lot with new Bentleys again
I want some top from like two sets of twins
Twinnie twin twins, yeah, yeah
Ayy, bitch (bitch), where your friends? Yeah, yeah
(Hol' up) switch (hol' up), she won't end, yeah, yeah
Ball 'em in, fallin' in bundles of flowers like parliament
Never know, big dawg like ours
So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked (And I poked)
And I poked at it but it stayed stagnant
Then I poked at it some more (Some more)
And in my notepad, man, I wrote (Man, I wrote)
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip, then a toe tag is one last, I'ma hope (I'ma hope)
So iceberg don't float (Don't float)
If I do manage to do damage to you, dammit
It'll be grand as, ten Grammies on my granite, still standin' with a note (With a note)
That read, ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most (The most)
One day, it'll make you grow (You grow)
When you outlandish and you lose manners, to God you shall consult (Consult)
When the bright cameras are still crammin' in your face and it provoke (Provoke)
You to act mannish, just stay planted 'cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep (Keep) positivity in your heart and (And)
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (And)
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
(Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em, Lord?
(Ooh-ooh)
Do you hear 'em, Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live, even with remorse that I give
When they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
(Ooh-ooh)
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me, don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord
Ooh-ooh
*Woman moaning*
Ooh
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction (Come on)
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?
Hear me out
We’re fragile
(Wish I’d have known)
I never thought I’d be so fragile
(You’re not alone)
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
(We’ve been here before)
I don’t ever want to change
I’m fragile
I don’t ever want…
I don't ever...
Tell me that I'm famous
Tell me that my name is
Big as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know you're heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favourite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
Stop...
Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
Drop...
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin' and abusin'
What I call the realest comin' from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an UZI
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'
That was nicotine, I'm bout to smoke 'em all
And journalists involved should've known my music
We’re fragile
(Wish I’d have known)
I never thought I’d be so fragile
(You’re not alone)
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
(We’ve been here before)
I don’t ever want to change
I’m fragile
I don’t ever want…
I don't ever...
And we don't stress
A .38 'til it free your chest
Then PP on the PO's desk
I'm Jay-Z in a blow out press
Relate me to your blowout's best
Can't hate me, I'm remote you're deaf
I'm HD, causin' photo theft
My AC antifreeze gotta—that part
Hold your breath, I'm 8 feet when I hold this TEC
Protect me from the local threats
My ID say my eye don't rest
My IV qualify T-rex
Society kept my IQ vexed
Denyin' me from an Ivy school
Applyin' me to the street I slept
I quietly had to hold this tool
Reminding me of the block I repped
The turf I stepped, the church and the earth I blessed
The first I guessed the alert was the murk I chef
That hearse the flirt with perks of a kill confessed
Dispersed the worst, the first 48 addressed
The search of laws and verse of the birth I nest
The—uh, the awe, the curse of a pose in zest
The good, the flaws, the pain to reverse what's left, uh
Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir: "What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city
All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: "Lift up your shirt," because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard 'em chatter: "He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city."
All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city
I fucked up the rap game and you ain't even know it
I just fucked what's her name and you ain't even know it (you ain't even know it)
She got a *beep* tattoo and you ain't even know it (real talk)
We about to form a little group and you ain't even know it, let's get it
Stuck in a rock and a hard place
Eminem, Pac and where God stay
Timberlands pop that jaw bone
Now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
And even Tarzan can get swung on
I never hung out with the loud mouth
You got a foul mouth
And that dead body gon' smell foul when it fouls out
She filed my nails in the Bahamas
We found ourselves in the Bahamas
She found God, meditation, and peace
I found myself without a condom
You know everybody having them babies
It's a beautiful thing it ain't crazy
If a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is?
Too many bitches got rabies
And I hate a ho-hoppin' woman
Stank pussy-poppin' woman
You fuckin' fool don't know about you
But my dick need 17 years on it
Anything after that is just a bonus
And I been in the lab with my opponents
And since Sway done swayed that list
He got a flatscreen the next morning
Tell 'em I need my credit when it's due
Tell 'em I need my lettuce when it's new
Tell 'em I got a fetish for fine fabric, Franklins and saying, "Fuck you"
Tell 'em it's TDE 'til I'm DDT'd in that grave
And Top Dawg is proof
'til my nigga Whoo Kid get free, ain't shit comin' for free
I'm 'bout to rape you niggas 'til you recoup
(Dizzle)
If you was in a pine box (Box)
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in an-and fall asleep (I fall asleep)
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me ('Cause you are)
If you was in a pine box (Box)
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep (I fall asleep)
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me
'Cause you are, the-the death of me, you-you, the death of me
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar, women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel, live the ambiance all
'Cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat, Capitalize That
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me
A false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as… myself
And it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you're outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home
I know everything
I know everything, know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement, their sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line's for Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth
I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didn’t know shit
The day I came home
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said, "Kendrick, you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh, I forgot, 'Don't Kill My Vibe', that's right, you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family's ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit
I know your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest in peace
Then be an advocate, tell your homies especially
To come back home"
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money or mankind?
Tell me something, got me losing my mind, ah!
You make me wanna jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something, think I'm losing my mind, ah!
I say, where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 Special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is
Niggas'll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it—pussy
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it—pussy
Double back handicap and go blind for it—pussy
Pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculating and good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the code names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
Solána, middle fingers up, speak your truth
Like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy, like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind
I will make you beg for it
I wanna see you crawl
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
I'll give you all of me and I won't stop, not a little bit
(Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride)
Make you beg for it, I wanted to do it all
(Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why)
Unfortunately you couldn't get your shit together
(Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride)
(Ride, ride, ride, ride)

Young Egypt
Look, look
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forecastin' my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to you
*Gunshot*
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on (Hell yeah), come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on
This is a fifteen minute song (Ahahaha)
We're just jammin' out, we on stage
Taz, we just jammin' out (Shhh)
Hundred thousand (Aw, yeah, aw, shit, hahahaha)
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody
Now I don't let you down, down for
You see, you see, you see, you see (Right)
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you, uh
They say the government ain't the truth, truth, (Mhm) truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
But head is the answer
Head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now (Hahahaha)
Head is the answer (Yeah)
Head is the futu—it's the future, that nigga said
Don't second guess yourself (Crazy, holy shit, hahaha)
Come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on—my background singer—come on, come on (Right, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

I gotta take it there, I ain't even playin' no more
Uh, said you just make me wanna drag you down
To the ground, to the ground
Like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
Ju—you just make me wanna drag you down
To—down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
And, baby, if your mama's around if your mama's around
If your mama's around if your mama's around
Tell her, tell her
No discrimination (Haha), she young nigga chasin' (Ahahah!)
And she can get this dick too!
I said come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, nigga
You gotta do it, man
We gonna lay that shit
We gonna lay that shit man and watch what it's gon' do
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
(I want you more than you know)
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, "You crazy?"
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
You said to me, you said your name was Lucy
I said, "Where's Ricardo?"
You said, "Oh, no, not the show"
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, "Oh, shit"
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible"
Get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home
Uh, I got a halo
I level up every time God say so
Shooter on payroll
Lookin' like Pancho, lookin' like Pedro
Money tree from Tarzan
Ten dividends gon' grow when I say "grow"
Kung Fu Kenny with the Midas touch
Ain't no penny that I don't touch
All my enemy bite on dust
Ain't no talkin' when it's fatal
Havin' heart, I can't tell
Half of y'all might need help
I might fall in Rodeo (bitch)
I might ball in Australia (say no more)
I might call her for real (say no more)
All the ass gon' unveil
Wind blows in the windows
And I snuck in when the vent close
She copy like 10-4
Know who we sent for
Platinum, platinum, platinum
Gotta look at self and ask what happened
How y'all let a conscious nigga go commercial
While only makin' conscious albums?
How y'all let the braids on TV?
How y'all let the hood at the table?
Now y'all don't even know how to rate him
Niggas lookin' like I'm a created player
Everybody who didn't pay respect
Gotta 'fess up now and pay ya debts
Gotta lay somethin' down if makin' threats
Gotta say somethin' now, don't hold ya breath
I mean, I'm floatin', I got the sauce, got the potion
I got 'em all in convulsions and emotions
I put careers in negotions
And put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when my nigga told me to go in
Then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin' life on a slow end
Gotta keep shit rollin', it's deep (it's deep)
I done fucked so much, I can't sleep
I done fucked so much, I'm retired (swear to God)
I'm 'bout to live my life through Dave Free (swear to God)
She said she broke down when Prince died (it's alright)
Bitch, my hair down, Prince live through me (I am Prince)
Get your ass up and be inspired (get inspired)
You know how many bodies in the street? (how many?)
Take the mask off so you can see
Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention
Dark as the midnight hour, or bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit' told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...
Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth
W-W-W-What is it?
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"You better change, ch-ch-change"
"Dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, day-ah" (What is it?)
You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my momma's Christmas party
Trouble's on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, "Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said, "Son, how come you think you be my connect?"
I said, "Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect"
He said, "Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga!
Now reap what you sowed, nigga! (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession
Let's get it
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"You better change ch-change, ch-change, ch-change, cha-ange"
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"Th-Th-Th-Th-They must be on the dick of who?"
"Th-Th-Th-Th-They must be on the dick of who?"
Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Fuck, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't give a fuck and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, fuck your amenities, I'm gettin' better with time
AHHHHH!
I hate y'all, I'd do anything to replace y'all
Shout out to Face Mob
A ghetto boy 'til I'm unemployed with a day job
And kicking boxes
I kick ass and then kick knowledge, I'm way more polished
Than 99% of the scholars you thought had graduated
I'm the master that masturbated on your favorite emcee
Until the industry had wanted me assassinated
You either corny or an opportunist, I let you eat
Now go back to church and steal crackers at communion
What I been doing? I'm about to crack the Da Vinci Code
Yeah and nothing's been the same since they dropped "Control"
And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes
Ha-ha, joke's on you
High-five; I'm bulletproof
Your shots'll never penetrate
Pin a tail on a donkey, boy, you been a fake
I got my thumb on Hip-Hop, and my foot in the back of your ass
Aftermath get the last laugh
I serve niggas like master Geoffrey, jump on the curb
Turn a shotty to a verb if you let me, you know I'm a killer
I'm on your head, you know I'm a killer
The West Coast Cosa Nostra
Under oath 'til it's over, you over-owe us
So what the fuck? I fuck you niggas up, I fuck you niggas up
She suck and fuck, I fuckin' duck you fuck niggas like when I want
You go at us, you going fuckin' nuts, acting irrational
Pop you then pop an Adderall, know the drill like a lateral, nigga
I'm more Pappy Mason than Pastor Mason
Pacing back and forth and racing, my thoughts
On them racing Daytons
I spilled blood on my apron cooking this shit up
I feel like some of y'all is hating
Quite frankly, your bitch booty should thank me for grabbing it
Turn these hoodrats to actresses, what a magic trick
Accidents never happen when murder's involved
Immaculate tactics, so follow me, if you need me, just call on me
I say, "Hold up, wait a minute
Your career ain't shit unless you got some Kendrick in it"
Your pussy ain't shit, ain't no room is left on my dick
Unless you look like Jordin Spark
Make my mark on that clitoris, mwah
Hollywood's been good to me
Lil' hood nigga used to pawn mom's jewelry
Family jewels big as fuck and I got the balls to say it
Balls deep, ballin' out 'til Spalding need a replacement
I'm outchea, the West in your mouth, chea
Invest in the vests of Vietnam vets when you out near
The white court building, spilling its Merlot
Fillin' women, a Virgo
Pimp the industry, 'member these Stacy Adams and furcoats
Shook, you're scared to death
You're scared to look in the mirror when Kendrick is near you
King Kendrick!
Welcome to vigilante, 80's so don't you ask me
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry
Peelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you getting fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightnin' bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travellin' freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula draggin' the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the 90's
Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me that
Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with
But they fuck with me, and bitch I love it
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons)
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons)
Let's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a 40-ounce to the neck and
In retrospect I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas
I tell you mothafuckas that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get a 64, better know how to drive it
I'm drivin' on E with no license or registration
Heart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of Ronald Reagan, rake the leaves off
Your front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga)
He blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here)
He copping some blow, hopin' that it can stretch
Newborn massacre, hopping out the passenger
With calendars, cause your date's comin'
Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin', because
Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with
But they fuck with me, and bitch I love it
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons)
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop, woop de woop
Woop de woop, woop de woop-woop (California Dungeons)
Can't detour when you're at war with your city, why run for?
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store, right there
When you fight, don't fight fair cause you'll never win
Can't detour when you're at war with your city, why run for?
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store, right there
When you fight, don't fight fair cause you'll never win (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said "You know what, girl? You crazy." Then she asked me what he said...
(What did the Asian say?) "A peace of mind"
That's what the Asian said—I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said "taking my time"
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?
(What did the Indian say?) "A piece of land"
That's what the Indian said—I needed the man
Telling me longevity is in the dirt
Should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
(Now, what the black man say?) "A piece of pussy"
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit, to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said "nigga, come back to reality for a week"
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it
(What the white man say?) A piece of mine's
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
"Look at what you accomplishing"; what he said to the boy
"I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market
If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
Your world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece"
What the black man say?
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Uh, shoutout to ScHoolboy Q
He uglier than a motherfucker (laughs)
Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I’m a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC, oh my God, you gotta see
There’s never no I's in me
Of an Odyssey, I’m a block away
Fire marshal's moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I’m so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don’t care where ya are
Just blink twice and I’m there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killas, pimps
You ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It’s gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
I’ma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
Cause I’m going out with a fist raised
And a fist full of money give it to the fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don’t wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free J’s put us in PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
God-Damn, y'all cold
Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go
Although I’m in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
Take it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I’m being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
With your BM in it and your stash box glove
And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
I’m at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your careers over, he’s slumped over
And if I'm off beat know I’m un-sober
That's a new flow
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I’m a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
I’m a factor and your facial
I will fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math
Pastor’s like Eddie long, fucking maricon
Took me mighty long to get here
Nigga, Fuck!
See any angels in the city
See any angels in the city
See any angels in the city
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
Kendrick, and I wear pendant on my shoulder
Soldier, like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted, got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down, knowin' damn well
We don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar
'Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin' when the L.A. Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickridin'
I'm addicted to Westsidin'
Livin' in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
Tryin'… and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city where a nigga hadn't seen that shit
"Compton!" – a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never TV-screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit!
Red is a very emotionally and intense color. It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has a very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stop lights, and fire equipments are usually painted red. It also represents one third of California's gang population. Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle. Thank you! Enjoy it!
Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
(Pussy ass ho niggas) I can't fuck with y'all
(Bitches all up in my business) I can't fuck with y'all
(Industry of counterfeits) I can't fuck with y'all
Taking off when you landing
Bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums
And I'm dancing on them stars
The galaxy ain't got room for y'all
Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
While I'm here and every day I hear
Your bullshit, self-pity
Reason why you never dealt with me
Reason why your girl dealt with me
Hands up, in the building, we get busy and say
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
That's exactly what this sound like
A to the A to the L-I-Y-A-H, give it up 2 times
Then give it right back, don't blow my high
Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
(Pussy ass ho niggas) I can't fuck with y'all
(Bitches all up in my business) I can't fuck with y'all
(Industry of counterfeits) I can't fuck with y'all
Look at my life then look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?
Time'll never wait on no man
Society will never hold your hand
Niggas like the gossip, like bitches
Got me thinking you don't like bitches
Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans
Eyes of a coward, I understand
Niggas like the gossip, like bitches
Sip Dom Pérignon, when we finish, we say
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
That's exactly what this sound like
But never will I ever forget Left Eye
Roll up, put a ribbon in the sky
And a button on your lips, don't blow my high
Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
(Pussy ass ho niggas) I can't fuck with y'all
(Bitches all up in my business) I can't fuck with y'all
(Industry of counterfeits) I can't fuck with y'all
Now everybody sing this shit
I'm sending him a four-page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss (a kiss)
And when I write him, he better
Get it on time
Look at my life, and look at yours
Get some ambition why you bored
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix
Wakanda, welcome
Big shot (Hol' up, wait)
Peanut butter insides (No)
Outside
Cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot (Big shot) (Hol' on, hol' on)
Peanut butter insides (Hol' on)

Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Sir Duckworth or Kung-Fu Kenny
Got juice, got work, got weight, got plenty
Got them, got her, got more, got Benji, yeah

I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes
Everything I do is too alumni
I'ma take my time, I'ma master it
You should be mindful of a mastermind
Put a landmine right where your momma live
Now blow up, blow up, hold up, I ain't seen your kind before
See me as a dollar sign 'til I resign or you report
That I done you wrong, and I mean you know my home endeavors
Nigga right now, it's now or never
Nigga right now, I'm high as ever, but however...
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick

Too many niggas, not enough hoes

Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes
Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre
And they wanna tell me, I made it
Nigga I ain't made shit, if he gave me a handout
I'ma take his wrist and break it
Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo, chilling with two hoes in here
And they tie my laces, living the Matrix as them pills disappear
Me and my niggas just acting bad HiiiPower conglomerate
Living that life and counting this cash old friends I no longer have
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
How many souls do you touch a day?
How many hoes do you fuck a day?
How many flows do your thought convey?
How many know you can't walk away?
Depending on the way I feel, I might kill everybody around me
Might heal everybody around me, how the wind blow
Open your window, let the debris in, never let me in
I kick back with kick do'
Maybe if I could live hundred years that be real?
Pay me if I'mma be rhymin' these homonyms
Crazy, my other show went to my mom 'n' 'em
My daddy said a Mercedes had haunted him
But now he got one, I'm ridin' shotgun
With a three-piece chicken dinner and shot gun
I bring your weekend to an ending and pop one
I'm in the deep end, boss nigga you not one
And I believe in Kool-Aid and God's son
Do you believe that Black man is our sun?
I made enough residuals to hide some
I gave enough, my niggas know I divide some
I told Zay, I'm the best rapper since twenty five
Been like that for a while now, I'm twenty-nine
Any nigga that disagree is a fuckin' liar
Pardon me, see my alter ego was Gemini
Him and I been around ever since Reagan was criticized
Might stay in the Trump Tower for one week
Spray paint all the walls and smoke weed
Fuck them and fuck y'all and fuck me
I proceed my last check in proceeds
To all the kids, the hood, the bricks, the books
To fix the blocks we on to right my wrongs
The word, to give the life we live as I get...
Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only 17
Then seven cars start honking
She start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
She give it all to her daddy but she don't know her father
That's ironic
See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
Remember the sergeant let her slide, said if he seen
What's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind
She made it where nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour
She suddenly realized, she'll never escape the allure
Of a black man, white man, needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
10 months before she was 10 he moved in
And that's when he touched her
This mothafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing to that
Block away from Lueders Park
I seen the El Camino park
And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind
She made it where nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder
Left for dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song
My little sister 11, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a bitch would
I wish a bitch would, I wish a bitch would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would
I wish a bitch would
I wish a bitch would, I wish a bitch would
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would (DaBoii)
I wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga
Fast money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars
I know you dying to meet him, I'll probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million
And a Comptown fitted
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping — Section.80
Back in this bitch, in the back of that bitch
With my back against the wall
And your bitch on the edge of my dick—jump off!
I call a bitch a bitch, a hoe a hoe, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddling
With the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven
Wicked as 80 reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? there's no one, not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't a option
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin' —
Hey, hey, kick her out the studio, Ali
24/7, nigga working his ass for it, she popping that ass for
The King of Diamonds with diamonds, I never do ask for it
They checking my passport, I'm too accustomed with customs
She callin' the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff him
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain
When you niggas is past poor? You'll never hop in my lane
When you pushing a RAV4, you wrecking my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't an option
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga
I wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor
Hol' up
Gather around. I'm glad everybody came out tonight. As we stand on our neighborhood corner, know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have. Listen, Keisha, Tammy, come up front. I recognize all of you. Every creed and color. With that being said... fuck your ethnicity. You understand that? We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you. All of you...
Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse
They getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut! Man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind
So don't you mind how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts
Everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
Going postal, never freeze up, when I approach you
That's starstruck and roast you, oh my
HiiiPower
Reporting live from Planet Terminator X
I saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
I'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus
I was kicking that math, dropping that science
Like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass, lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me, I'ma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate my dreams, get it right
Get a life, I got two, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly, put wings on my back
That a plane or an angel? Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa... gross
I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you
I'm just a messenger, yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her
Put them 3's up, they notice that we up, HiiiPower
And the power in the people and if they don't believe us
They'll die
Wizard
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, y'all let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle of Hennessy in his hand, actin' a fool
Hey, hey, babe, check it out, I'ma tell you what my mama had said, she like:
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name
Askin' "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
And the world don't respect you
And the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
Askin' "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie
(Pause)
What do you got to offer?
Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi
Niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies
Bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
So loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
Big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke
I can't stand myself
Big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit...
Turn me up
Sin City, Sin City
Sin City, Sin City
Big money, big booty bitches
Tell the truth, nigga, I'm lost without it
7 figures for a headline
You want some stage time? We can talk about it
Niggas actin' like they be rappin'
Like nice on the mic, truly doubt it
Go against the kid, y'all don't wanna live
That decision is hella childish
Rose gold for my old hoes
They ain't satisfied then I sit 'em down
10th grade, I gave her all shade
But now she got some ass, I wan' hit it now
I don't lease, I just all out feast
I put a blue Caprice on Gary Coleman
Bomb head and some cheese eggs
That's a new raise and a signing bonus
I got big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big dreams, no superstition
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke
I can't stand myself
I just might ban myself
I just might... God!
I got big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big dreams, no superstition
That shit gon' be the death of me (death of me)
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I just might go broke
I can't stand myself
I just might damn myself
I just might... GOD!
GOD!
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"
Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
Just Blaze
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
Mom, I finna use the van real quick!
Be back, 15 minutes!
Ali, you thirsty on Twitter!
You boo-boo, you T'd
You turned down, you thirsty
You boo-boo!
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off
'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say...
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off
'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep
'Cause everytime y'all come around
Y'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up
Keep it running, Ali
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say
So tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"
Tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"
Yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you thirsty
Tell 'em "Shut the fuck up!"
Tell 'em "Shut the fuck up!"
Yeah, nigga, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you thirsty
You thirsty, you boo-boo
You T, you turnt down
You boo-boo, you T'd
You boo-boo, you turnt down
You thirsty, you T'd
You boo-boo, you turnt down
You boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you weak
You weak, yo’ bitch weak
Yo- (laughs)
You boo-boo, you T (laughs)
Keep all that
What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it’s known today that the human race is nothing
No morals, no standards
What we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations
No, you don’t have to have a lot of money
You don’t have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religion
Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio State gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
Now one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a billion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy, we'll hurt you
Life in the power circle
Time and time, I drop line for line but only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine and cop thirty 9s and cock back and kill
See, the truth is they wanna know
How close me, Dre, and Snoop is
Or how the shoe fits when they choose this
To beat 2Pac, but truth, I give two shits
'Bout expectations or critics hatin'
Shit, I just put Moms on vacation
Bitch, you never know my new location, it's across nations
Court cases get thrown out
So tell the mothafuckin' king dethrone now
I am ruler, I am highness, the Prince Zamunda
I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black tint like Kinte Kunta
Black is back, bitch, I'm kin to Kunta
Black-on-black crime resent the shooter
Blat, blat, blat! I intend to mute ya
Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks
Without my A-game, so please don't ask me about no pressure
Bitch, with the grip of my fingertip I can hold this coast together
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
Frustrated and I'm riding down them back streets
Making my conscience ask me
"Will I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly, black boy fly
Black, black boy fly, black boy fly
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly
I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, "Oh shit, wait"
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homie
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical?
Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton
Thank God
(Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly)
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people
I'm inspired, so get inspired
And so he said "Why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't?
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
Why you let me use yours cus I don't got mine?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
Or when niggas holla, "What's up?" you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me, Why you always thinking of me
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you" (Sometimes)
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
And so she said "Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying, "Hi, Daddy"?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still like my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even tho you get violent and put your hands on me?" (Sometimes)
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
It still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts
And Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect
I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
Or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have
And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from
We buy guns and more guns to give to the young
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga
Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight
He told me "Rap about life, not rap niggas"
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin'
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating, then my final intuition
Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listened to "Faith," and think I know Zion
But really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth
Because it seem like it's always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice
I ain't lying
I swear to God, half of y'all just don't know Kendrick
The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness
You just mind your business
You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis
It's kind of scary, ain't it?
You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless
'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hate it
So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
So if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him
Facing 25 to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if our record never break, I still won’t break my promise
I promise to keep it honest
Secret society, all we ask is trust
And all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And I'm like, "The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?"
Gotta keep it pushing
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins'
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin'
Never will I surrender
I been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
How splendid, I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
They said seven tracks, I said 15
Called it an EP, they said I’m trippin'
But little did they know, I’m tryna' change the rules
That we’ve been confined to, so the corporate won’t make decisions
Uppity bitches handling business
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
Out in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home
In LA everybody think they fucking on
Hop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit
Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God most of y'all cats just don’t know Kendrick
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended
Ain’t doing this for my health, I’m tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes
Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions
Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living
Look, the mastermind took the master's mind
Just the perfect time, just to master mine
Just to match the grind with precision
Look, the mastermind took - (cough)
We got London on the track
Got my bae with me, you know what I'm sayin'?
If she don’t get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high (I'm so happy)
Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that
I know she livin' for a nigga, dyin' for a nigga
I whip that pussy with no ballers jumpin' out, lil' nigga
That pussy look just like a cut, a soakin' cut, lil' nigga
Yeah, I'm a freak, you know I'm pullin' up to lush, lil' nigga
I'd never snooze to lose, I would never snooze to lose on you
Yeah, I'ma give you a couple bands, want some more boobs on you
Hey, I'ma sit back and pay attention like school on you
Yeah, I'ma shoot inside that pussy like a wholly on you
Goddamn, I'm sorry b, I know you'd accepted my apology
I know that ass fat, apple bottom please
I need a deep throat baby, swallow me
I love it when you're around baby, follow me
I only eat green, yeah, koala leaf
We shoot with big guns like a Call of D
She never say no, she ain't stallin' me
I kept my heart locked up in a safe, hey
You can't shoot with a pistol, need a K
No, you can't see it, it is tragic by your face
But when it need air, let it out in a safe lil' place
I can see it on her face that if she don't get what she want
When she don’t get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high
Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that, I know she worth
No these ain't no drugs, I know she worth
Yeah, my mama say that she ain’t perfect
But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work
Yeah, roll me some kush I don't want no purp (hey)
Damn, I broke her heart, now my heart hurt
I don't know why but I done cut down on that syrup
At least I got that lil' bitch ballin', she don't gotta work
Oh-no-no, she ain't had no job, but she having purses
Yeah-yeah-yeah, she know I'm the truth, places I'm in first
No-no-no, I don't want you bitches, y'all basic and thirsty
Yeah-yeah, she taught me well, it took some time, but it was worth it
She get on top and she ride it, Kentucky derby
You should see, I count that money like a nerd bitch
I'ma ball some with my dawgs but they ain't Courage
Her whole body same color, I call it perfect
Since she don't get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high (yeah)
Looked up baby and say goodbye (Bobby Bruh)
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that, I know she worth
No these ain't no drugs, I know she worth
Yeah, my mama say that she ain’t perfect
But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work
Yeah, roll me some kush I don't want no purp
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
I used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition had said I was suited for family ties
My momma is stressin', my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
How I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with ya will squeal with ya
I deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun
And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, 23 hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
That you hear the music I wrote
Hope it get you off Death Row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
I'ma get it right, just so you...
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with ya will squeal with ya
I like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
I'm 23 with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back and for that I give them my torso
You think about it; and don't call me lyrical
'Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make their similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals that live life critical
So won't you bear witness while I bare feet
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On "Wanna Be Heard" probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
He'll probably be out of work, laid back, while he...
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my drum
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, I'm drunk
How come I can make them popular, pop em' when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
Fuckin' up the system, I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, I'm gone
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is Father Time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligent, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
A tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify
But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
I'm passin' lives on a daily, maybe I'm losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
I'm sleepwalkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or this is just a mirage or a facade?
Wait
Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make her
Wrap this much make-up off my bed, soon as she's yawnin', take up
Hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre, I mean
The sun is slowly fallin', we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?
Identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open of oceans
That coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game
I'm hopin' you picked the second one, shame
The emotion of jealousy that you're holdin', you're tellin' me
That you're golden but really cubic zirconia, let me see
I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you're Mayweather you
Fuck me
I want you to fuck me (I want you to fuck me)
I want you to fuck me (Oh yeah)
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Oh, fuck
Don't stop
Stop
Praise to the almighty, HiiiPower
Me and my niggas (Live forever)
3 eyes to my alumni
Feel this
I wanna hear it, turn me up (My niggas on point, game tight)
Turn me up a little bit more nigga (My niggas on point, game tight)
My nigga Cole in this motherfucker. Wassup nigga?
(My niggas on point, game tight)
There we go yeah, turn me up
Picture plenty pussies throwing pellet guns at me
Paranoia make it more than difficult for me to sleep
Pinnacle, I know I be, centerfold, I know I got
But they hate to frame me as the Mona Lisa of Hip-Hop
So retaliation is a must, when we bend the block
My niggas dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put TNT inside my suit
Walk inside the label, struck a match, and then I blew, bomb
C4 everywhere, C4 everywhere
I got three whores with me, it smells like Dior and derrière
Decoys die slow, you can detour to Heaven's stairs
Or walk inside Hell's dungeon, I just might derail something
They pussies, I smell something
You douche on the daily, niggas, you pushin' up daisy
I push the gas on the Mercedes, nigga
Came in this game with a Rolie chain, and a dream
Became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew
Nigga that thought Good Kid gon' flop, or that I might go pop
Or your bitch won't drop, knees when my shit drop
Y'all too infatuated with the fucking numbers
Which make it easy for me to divide and conquer
I come from Compton, we ain't have it all
Smokers basing inside the cafeteria hall
And I'm putting fear in you all, see your skeletons shaking
Jump out your body, you Ricky Bobby until you naked
Y'all pray to God this week I be putting out bombs
I pray to God this beat is good enough for Shyne
If not J. Cole, your shit is trash
But at least my opinion just made everyone laugh
This is where we at? I guess it's entertainment
I guess this is speculation making a classic came with
If I ain't have the patience I'd probably self destruct
Real people want real music, the jig is up
Your worst fear is confirmed
We love that you crashed and burned
The real is back
K. Dot it's your turn, take your victory lap
King Cole salutin' Compton's own King Kendrick
Thats the sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
The city hail King Kendrick Lamar
The world hail King Kendrick Lamar
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew
This is my life and I look at it like its my last
And I'm lookin' right past the future as I reminisce on my past
And I don't even think how I used to, my mind is on rocket blast
And I don't even drink like I used too, and I don't even smoke
So you know this natural flow is for users that want to go to rehab
Lookin' at the coke that he had, matter fact that followers bother them
Then but I won't say my bad, see I just lay in the cut
Watch the product stack up, motherfucker what what
See now we dump'n out the roof
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
Cross my heart then I hope to die
With a peace of mind (A peace of mind)
Piece together my brain
Soon as this beat rewind (Beat rewind)
Nitrogen and propane
I spike your drink at times (Turn up, turn up)
I make it hard to swallow this game
You throw up every line (Every line)
I notice people got Napoleon complexes
That's my confession (Yeah, that)
You said that we're equal but I know you're beyond guessing
That I'm beyond desperate (Yeah, that)
6AM on a Friday morning, my darkest hours
Them heartless hours, my apartment is lost in a coffin
I'm dead to the world like I popped me a couple downers
Down & Out on my luck
Salt water all on my tux and I call, she don't pick up
Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean, there's no pretending
I'm stuck in my ways and you're offended, that's life
That's you, this me, that vice
You're wrong, I'm right, that's right
I belong somewhere on ice
I'm cold, and my new blood type?
Even colder, cold shoulder
Born Sinner, you know? Cole showed us!
I have nothing to lose
My dark side been well in-tuned
A Gemini gon' show them faces
And this here just one of my moods, Babylon
Visualize everything I needed and dream (uh-huh)
Penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme (what else?)
Guns in your video get you locked in a bing
Yeah, I kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean
Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up
Charity work, parking tickets and no charges
Fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick
Should have been a bitch in pajamas
I made my first million fucking dollars
Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular
I'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody
I'm on Instagram looking at your favorite singer
Debating on should I fuck her or jump on her single
20 thou, she got a hell of a adlib
I'm in her mouth like I knew I could have kids, K-Dot
Lord forgive me
Kill him where he stand and stand over him
Shake his hand then jump back in that minivan
Double back to his block and blam
I ain't backing down for nothing
I'ma back 'em down like Shaq
With this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man
Police radio signals saying that a 187 land on your corner
Coroners comfort your momma
"Momma, he's dead," the next morning
I toasted up with my homies, we drink and smoke marijuana
Want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from
Uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know, I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumping
On enemies; I'm head huntin', no sympathy, ain't no love
When you in these streets, just get something
Protect your neck 'cause they coming
For sets, respect, split your onion
Then chop your deck
Your head tumbling like gymnastics (Ooh...)
'Cause ignorance is bliss
This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock, I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol-whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off
Then peel off in a hooptie
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably, I'm too street—indubitably, I'ma do me
Better than your bitch would, 'cause you niggas too weak
But just give me two weeks and I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading; I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet
Cats so watered-down clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch 'em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently, you're a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves... that ignorance is bliss
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard
I'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call
Ghostbusters 'cause you busters are Casper when I go off
I show up, to show out and show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you are, then wreck your car
And walk up to my crime scene
I remember bein' 17, wishin' someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back
Is when they rewind me
Backin' down bargains, backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her
Once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
'Cause ignorance is bliss
We on?
Aight
1,2,3, go!
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name in unison, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth 'cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'mma show you how to make it all work
Another planet, it's a short term goal for me
A record sold for me
It's just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours
You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe in lungs of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here
"What is going on in Compton? I don't understand it."
"Well as it relates to this, this is not in my field as the clerk so anything that relates to this, you'll probably have to get an answer from Dr. Dre."
Motherfucker know I started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle
Mixin' that with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem
Wasn't thinking 'bout no rapping, I was juuging for a dollar
Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla
No policing me, I got the beast in me, I gotta holla
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
Inner city bullet flyin' 'til that bitch on auto pilot
Ah, shit! I don't give a fuck about your whereabouts
All I care about is wearing out your area
And airing out your upper body
When I catch ya walking out your parents house
(Don't get it fucked up!) Homie got fucked up
Tryna park his tour bus, not knowing what's what
Or who's who, living in the L.A. County zoo
Pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof!
Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (Boom, boom, boom)
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (Boom, boom, boom)
That's when I realized banging wasn't for everybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
A great white, nigga, this is life in my aquarium
Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya
Life to end in vain before the end is near
See I can hear you crying
Silence sittin' in the dark
Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
Sin is such a work of art
Watch out for the love lost
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Things a nigga do for thousands
Made a million counting sheep
Gave it all to public housin'
Taking off to Abu Dhabi
Beamin' up the motor, Scotty
Talking to promoters, Scotty
Everybody know it's Gotti
Murder one, you've heard of them
The rev undid, the all day madness
Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress
Big power, big stages
My zoo cannot fit the cages
This booth is not used to fakin'
My crew just love confrontation
I chewed the face off the laces
I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison
I cooked then kicked all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic
That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
Ayy, look what we're enduring
Ayy, ridin' in foreigns
Ayy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch
But it's the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin' outside
The roof on it like a tank top
Countin' money, watchin' paint dry
When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
This what you really want, huh?
Turn me up, Ali
Black lip bastard, pass me your password
So I can hack inside your brain
See, I too have gone insane
Before I fall I'm sure to curse you all in Jesus' name
Lead shower, Anna Peebles hour, bitch stand the rain
This what y'all really want
Let me get it back Ali
When we do- when we do interviews, don't ask me 'bout no movements
Yeah I'm good
No crews, no-no posses, no cliques
If it ain't 'bout TDE I don't wanna hear that shit, bitch
Look inside my parkin' garage and see a collage
Of every person I despised since the moment I turned five
Calculate my steps and strategically took my time
Even fallin' off, I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj (so soft)
Eat that pink pussy like it's Friday
Bust one, roam and reload, then smoke to Sade
And somebody tell Rihanna too
I need that vagina too (hey baby)
Don't fuckin' take me for some kind of fool
I'm kinda the reminder of knowin' Compton ain't kinda cool
Good kid, mad city, mountaintops couldn't see my views
Countertops, we hop over, hit the register, then we move
I hope this shit can register on a regular soon
Before I climb this pedestal
And make you catch my fuckin' stool (bitch)
K.Dot, leave 'em grievin' on evenin' news
Even when society break even, I'll break rules
Is this what y'all really want?
This Black Hippy shit what y'all really want?
When I'm in interviews, don't ask me 'bout no crews
No posses, no cliques, don't tell me who's gettin' it
I don't give a fuck, nigga
I just paid— I just paid six figures in taxes, nigga
Off Section.80, on some independent shit
Uncle Sam talkin' 'bout, "you an old lost relative," nigga fuck you
K-Dot said it, not Kendrick
Ab-Soul the rawest motherfucker on the planet, nigga
T.D.E., solar system, Control System, beyotch
I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a Mac book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness, of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
From heaven, is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips, all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her but when the make-up occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur
Ladies and gentlemen
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
Ladies and gentlemen
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is...
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life no longer infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our belief's the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling "he's alive"
Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tides out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) no more running from world wars
(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
"What have you did for me"
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise, I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you
Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'mma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church
Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switch
Say yeah
Share
Say yeah

Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other, and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little, living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things, and I would see him and think "what a cute guy," and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...
So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
I'm ready to go, ready to go
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Ready to go, ready to go
Life is a traffic jam
Life...
I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie, I do, Section 80
Your son will play me if the radio won't
Daughters that just turn 1 'til 21 listen to Kendrick
For instance:
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV
True story!
Hmm
Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now, my child, come on
See, a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
You know what all the things have in common?
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent 23 years on this earth searching for answers
'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So, the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
'Cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially-aware rapper
I am a human motherfucking being over dope-ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar!
Now fuck 'em up, Terrace!
(Soul!)
I watch this fire that we’re gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
Section.80
Section.80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
Know they can't control us
Know they can't control you
Know they can't control us
But we can control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight
You will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something that's bigger than all of us
Our family
Heart, honor, and respect
This is you
This is me
And we are HiiiPower
(Why I go easy?)
(Know why I go easy)
Wait
King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision, kings did it
King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king!
I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned
The lens that I'm lookin' through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for?
Are you a activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?
Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
KING! KING! KING! KING! KING!
I am T'Challa
8-8-8-808 Mafia
Tarentino
I don't trust these niggas
I don't trust these bitches
Drunk right now, so you know I meant it
8-8-8-808 Mafia
If you know me then you know
Nigga, Chi-town like my second home
I done flew a private jet for some Harold's Chicken straight from Rome
I done bust down on a few thots, Fredo hit me on my phone
"Nigga, I can't talk right now, gnom-gnom-gnom-gnom
Got pussy on my tongue."
I got worry on my brain, I been gone all summer
Just to fly back home and found out y'all done killed my little brother
Shit is fucked up on these streets
Why the fuck would I think about some rap beef?
Nigga, I got bigger fish to fry now
Empty out my account and I'll pay for sleep (8-8-8-808 Mafia)
Where's my bottle?
Money change and people change
And people come and people go and act estranged
I'm aggravated 'cause they hated
Confirmation for success anticipated
I can taste it, I can chase it back down with liquor
I could drown out my sorrows
But I ain't a sorry-ass nigga
Get up off your ass, make yourself a hundred racks
Bitch, get up off your ass, throw it back back back
Back inside my 'Bach, back in a garage that we can jack
Bitch, I love my hood, I'm strapped up, what's good?
Heard someone said— (8-8-8-808 Mafia)
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
Wait a minute!
Now, why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
Why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby (broke home baby)
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies (broke boy and babies)
Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy"
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye, and said "nigga you fucked up"
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
And your pain ain’t mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
Bitch, I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town
In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
Pimp pimp (hooray!)
Two tears in a bucket, I cry with you, agh!
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight, I freeze up when I re-up
See, I barely have patience, and you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it? Went to work for it
See, a nine-to-five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all, but if I can shortcut my success
Corvettes by tomorrow, ugh!
Why so sad? Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have, blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell 'em color me bad, blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down
My homegirl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a Black woman wishin'
She saying this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh, the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women don't prosper chasin' education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But ain't no money like fast money
Even today, I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
But why I'm so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have, blue faces (Faces)
I hit the bank today and tell 'em, color me bad, blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down, to the top
I love God, I love speed
I love drank, I love mead
I love oceans in the deep
I love women, I love me
I love God
Ugh! But I’m scared of godspeeeeeeed
Sometimes
I wrote this song
Looking at a broke home, maybe (Broke home, maybe)
You know the poverty-stricken
The little broke boy and babies (Broke boy and babies)
Somebody say "Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy"
And I said “Why?”
Then he looked me in the eye
And said "Homie, you're messed up
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
Never been through 'ish, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
YSay you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t it, I live in a hut
You're living to keep warm, I'm living to pay rent
I paid my way through, praying to Allah
You played your way through, dealing with wi-fi
Bull-'ishing yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope, huh?
These days ain’t no compromise, ugh
Your pain ain’t mines half the time, ugh
A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me
See, I made my moves with shackled feet"
Cape Town, Cape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town
Caaaaaaaaape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town
Ugh!
Cornrow Kenny
All morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrrt!
Morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrrt-skrrt!
Cornrow Kenny
So many plays on me, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I react
Me and Top is like a Kobe-and-Phil
A father figure; play with him, you get killed
Play with me and he-a kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juugin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juugin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb things in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 9-11
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Me, I'm about to let my hair down to hoes
Ali 'bout to let his hair down to hoes
Top billing, that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no-whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama, "Be more like Punch"
Sounwave got a Grammy this year
Mackwop, bet he do what he want
Level two, level two, no, I’m not done
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
I could put a rapper on life support
Guaranteed, something that none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
Ward is like twenty-five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
Tell me that, tell me that that I'm the one
You ain’t got, you ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got tell me that, what! I’m the one
Yes, I’m the one!
Kung Fu Kenny, look look
Who the fuck you talkin' to? You mainey (you mainey)
Salute me when I'm walkin' through, you ain't me (you ain't me)
Everything I do is with the extras (extras)
Flip me couple million for investments
And my hood love me unconditional
Your hood love you 'cause you on the instrumental though
This rap shit crazy, need the woosah
They screamin' Compton, must be two sides
R.I.P. to Shawty Lo, yeah B. Dot know I'm flexin'
VIP my barrio, 200 on the guest list
I don't like to sugarcoat or politic with yes men
I like me a boujee hoe from Normandie and Western
2017 onto bigger things (bigger things)
I got a smaller team, got a bigger ring (bigger ring)
Everybody a Crip 'til they black and blue
Everybody a Blood 'til they hemorrhaging
Ah man, Mike WiLL Made-It
Two back to back Spurs, me and Mike WiLL made it
Double park on the curb, I can drive but I'm lazy
Half a pint, whole pint, gassed up, crazy, ayy
Check, check, check, check, check
It go...
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
To the meaning of life, what's my purpose?
Maybe this Earth is ain't a good place to be
How far is heaven? Let's see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?
Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner
I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer
What I'm doing, I'm saying that I'm human, now people just
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
It go one (one), two (two), three (three)
Two in the front, one in the back seat (seat), seat (seat), seat (seat), seat (seat)
Looking for a victim of an AK-47 100-round each, each, each
But why must we retaliate? Is it human nature?
I don't know, I look for the answers later
"Make a right, there they go!"
Sometimes gotta
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens
A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I'm right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking liar
When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it
I give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wilding, a young'n with lack of guidance
That's hundreds of us with problems
Mo' money, mo' drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
That's dealing with life the hardest, that's on my life
But regardless I'ma
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause I never know
When a bullet might hit me and I die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live my life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what I is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
Aha, and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
That you are likely to catch 'cause your latest ex made you mad
So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die - in it
Then reincarnate as a fly - gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
This the Olympics
State your name, live in the moment
It’s your time to own it, I see it in you baby
She tell me that she never give the first night away
And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them big trucks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we die - in it
Pull 'em to the side, let me slide up in it
You’re like a needle in a haystack
I wanna sit you where my face at
Lunch with a few Mai Tais
Purple kisses on my tie
Life can’t really predict love
Now you’re getting this dick, love
I’m looking for you with a flashlight
I want to feel what a real fat ass feel like
No injection, I learned my lesson
I walk it like I talk it, baby, this pedestrian
Runnin’ through your mind like Jackie Joyner
Pussy pop like (boom!) go get me a burner
Got shot like (boom!)
This can be detrimental
T-shirt and panties, that's your credential
You’re cotton candy, I need a fistful
I’m awful antsy, hope that convince you
Nigga do that shit, nigga done that shit
Nigga any problem, bet I overcome that shit
Twenty gold bottles I'ma drink on that shit
Twenty songs that I'm on, number one that shit
My name gon' ring and my team gon' win
I shot a nigga once, and I'd do that shit again
Put your hands on a Bible stealing candy at a store
To a black homicidal it's the same damn sin
Drop down, give me three points ho
K. Dot, give it to it how you want ho
I'ma show you what this West side about
I'ma pull up in a 'Rari at your grandmama's house, hey now
She got a nigga name in her mouth, hey now
T-O to N-O to ammo, I mean
My MO is zero, see commas, I promise
Go tell your mama this dick ain't for free
This dick ain't, this dick ain't
This dick ain't, this dick ain't
This dick ain't for free
Touch that, I need cash back, transaction
I bust back in a all black Grand National
Hoodrats in the project if you ask 'em
They wanna buy the world, 10 racks on they taxes
Holiday cheers, Sallie Mae checks
With a bottle to the neck, get it how you live it
I say hol up (hey!)
I just wanna ball like them grown ups (hey!)
Tell em catch me if they can
I switch gears then switch lanes
You know just what my mind's on these days
Keep singin' with me
I say hol up (hey!)
We just wanna ball like them grown ups (hey!)
Tell em catch me if they can
I switch gears then switch lanes
You know just what my mind's on these days
That’s what she said to me, that place I used to call home
Is just a bed to me
We don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync
That’s what it said to me, but the place I call ambition
Now dead to me, gone and forgotten, I’m off track
Like Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball
I’m calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell him, nah
That’s what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven's unfair to me, only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don’t know
I know to follow Him rather following people
Or follow vanity cause that means I’m following evil
Guess I’m following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don’t need you
So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is
Would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action?
It’s just a part of life and if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight
Don't judge me
I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-key
Looking like a star, with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
She got a nigga and she love this nigga, well, at least I think
Everytime we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street
She be like:
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other...
Until one day he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right
When he plead the fifth, man, it was on, matter of fact she gone
Matter of fact Tyrone was on speed dial
So when she got home, it was going down, she go:
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other...
I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
With that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist
In her man she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this
She be like:
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other...
Until one day he wasn't acting right in the middle of the night
She checked his pockets, found condoms by Magnum
And the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye
Then ran outside, then started driving on the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling, she gon':
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other...
And so, these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up
Put 'em in their world, their vulnerable world, and just like that
It was only getting they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound?
They got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now
Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
To lend each other uncover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they:
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas...
Tammy's song
These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini, duality personalities always conflicted me
Oh! But don't be scared of me, girl
I can explain
I know it's foreign to you
I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favor
Let me explain
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you how
I can explain
Oh shando! I spin around two times
I'll be there with the answer
Let me explain
My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets, covers and pillows
I'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
I'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero
Cause you believe in me
No you're not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you unique that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change
Because I know for sure who you are
I can explain
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand washing your clothes on Sunday
Let me explain
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed his body and soul
I can explain
Don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels
Let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But don't you ever
Let me explain
Oh shando! I spin around two times
A blessing in disguise
I can explain
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the odd
I am yours
I can explain
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
Ndiseza ndingene laduma vumile
Ndiseza ndingene laduma vumile
I woke up this morning with my dick on hard
Didn't know why 'til I said fuck all y'all
Or fuck this world, or I'mma fuck that girl
Good kid, m.A.A.d city, watch my day unfurl
I put my life in these sentences
Fucking right, it's either that or life sentences
I'm relatives with Benjamin
I used to give a fuck about my luck when I was innocent
Now what the fuck is up? I'm at your neck like a Pendleton
Nigga, I need that, bitch, I need that
Twenty-four acres and a mule, best believe that
They say he got smoke, like where the weed at?
And everything you hope, bitch nigga, we that
Pockets on Kelly Price back when it was '95
Buy a strap and then we cock it back when it's uncircumcised
Write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine
Give you dap and then we slide through your hood three dozen times
So what's good? I'm looking for a pedicure
Pink pussy that pop, preferably the kind that don't stink
Bomb-ass head 'til she can't blink
And her eyes get watery, you gotta pardon me
I'm so damn turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door
I'm so turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door
All praise go to the most high
All fades turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets, after fucking with police guaranteed
Last nigga did that died, don't you, don't you, don't you
Wanna live where the AK go for only 8K
Minus six racks, minus one on top of that?
Melee, stomp him out then drug him out like a date rape
Daytonas bending every corner while they say
I'm so turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door
All I ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds
And my teacher as my woman, when she smiled, I stick my tongue in
Plus some cartoons and some cereal, Snoop Doggy on my stereo
Some British Knights or LA Gears with glowing lights or Perry Ellis jacket
I would love a swapmeet full of Chevrolets in candy paint
That's wet with Tammy on the bumper, can I hump her? Poppa tell me yes
A DPGC concert and a DJ Quik song on cassette
Twenty years later: hi hater, I'm the fucking best
I'm so turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door
From Compton to Baltimore I'ma kill it
I buy a morgue in the minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted
The air conditioner broke
But I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo
(Huh?) And I peel off
In the midst of gettin' my thrills off
And I thrive off energies from inner cities that we lost (huh?)
I'm puttin' the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders
The engines on back of scooters
The real can recognize real
And we need to know just who you are
You are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick the gift for the future, oh yeah, I said it
Thug life, good kid, mad city
Mad respect representin' the hub right
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward]
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
Everybody know I spit that other shit
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
That's a jab, you should bob and weave
Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
Cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
I'm on five, you saying that I can level more?
In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
Creation of man, and Columbine
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
Look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers
Just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
They're new booties, they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for 40 days
40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted, like 40 gays
My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that I'm talking 'bout
You know the type of rhymes you don't talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
So my momma can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me, like "My son's 'bout to win
Somehow, someday, and I don't care when"
I might hit the gin once a month
I'll let you inhale, like an atheist
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I'll take you back to the 9th grade
When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days
That's my nigga, he a street nigga
Probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga
But anyway I think it was some purple
Told me "Don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you"
I didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders
Just underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T
Laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks
Now what you 'bout? Nothing huh
Am I a square cause I don't puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers give me H.O.C
(Bitch I'm blowed!)
Two-door coupe, hoppin' out like Jack-in-the-Box, nigga
I'm gon' shoot if this 30's all that I got, nigga
Time's up
Got my coins up, my bars up, soon we find 'em
We gon' slide 'em, we lined 'em, straight reclined 'em
Pistol grip, I got all kinds of, I'm not your driver
Shot gon' hit him, he won't answer, I'm blowin’ ganja
So much work, they call me old school, I remind ya
That bitch you think you got is not you, where you find her?
She a kickstand, a big fan, I get behind her
Then I slid it in, I win, I win, ayy
I mean that's bitch shit
Faking like you got it in your pockets, yeah, that's bitch shit
Talking to them hoes, you steady gossip, yeah, that's bitch shit
Telling on your mans so you can scram, yeah, that's bitch shit
Pull it out and acting like it jam, yeah, that's bitch shit
Hating on another nigga come-up, yeah, that's bitch shit
Staying in because you know it's summer, yeah that's bitch shit
You a bitch boy, on my mama, uh
Okay, let's get it, bitch, let's get it, woo
Got a plan, we gon' kill his man
The gun won't jam, it's on on sight
I might get life, that's on my life
The .44 fire, the goal green light
To build that price, it filled up nice
The god won't die
Okay, let's get it, bitch, let's get it, woo
See no flaws, in my purest form, bitch, I'm greedy, uh
Goyard tags, filled with hella cash, this my gimme bag
Zeroes add, we don't do no class, nigga, nine subtract, ayy
Two-door coupe, hoppin' out like Jack-in-the-Box, nigga
I'm gon' shoot if this 30's all that I got, nigga
Y'all on mute, ain't no back-talk on my block, nigga
Numb numb juice to the head, fuck up the opps, nigga
Two-door coupe, hoppin' out like Jack-in-the-Box, nigga
I'm gon' shoot if this 30's all that I got, nigga
Y'all on mute, ain't no back-talk on my block, nigga
Numb numb juice to the head, fuck up the opps, nigga
CrasH Talk, take two
I can see the darkness in me and it's quite amazing
Life and death is no mystery and I wanna taste it
Step inside of my mind and you'll find curiosity, animosity
High philosophy, hyper prophesied meditation
Reminisce on my wonder years and I wonder here
Sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
The sentiment of my nerves that I just persevere
The big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
They say that Heaven's real
Analyze my demise, I say I'm super anxious
Recognize I deprive this feeling and then I embrace it
Vandalizing these walls only if they could talk
Conversations won't contemplate to my dark thoughts
Lookin' down on my soul now, tell me I'm in control now
Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right
And I can sing song and I can unite the you that I love
You that I like, look at my life and tell me I fight
This that final destination, this that find some information
This that find some inspiration, this that crack, the installation
This that quantum jump and that fist pump and that bomb detonation
Please don't bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
I got mind control when I'm here, you gon' hate me when I'm gone
Ain't no blood pumpin' no fear, I got hope inside of my bones
This that life beyond your own life, this ain't physical for mankind
This that out-of-body experience, no coincidence you been died
Bitch, you're dead!
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me
Say you will never ever catch me
Say you will never ever
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Momma take this mothafuckin' block off
Tryna reach you every day, collect calls
Never get through, and I go through withdrawals
Say who told you that I wanted this door
To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yeah, every rack is yours
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K. Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
Mama just get back at me this last time
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Mama, take this mothafuckin' block off
That's on the date the day I take the block off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, this ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
'Member when you put me in that relay run
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I ain't built for all them goddamn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me mama
If you can't, then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last time
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Dante, if I stress to take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection, tell me who you see
Who is your protection? G-O-D
No, it's not neglect-ion, I have just accepted
Your fate and what its gon' be
'Member all the nights that I cried
Thinkin' that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, kickin' through the door
It's you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
You look at my lifestyle
I'm living my life now
I'm dealing with diligent Benjamin
How come my attitude piped down?
I'm fucking with Ice now
I'm fucking with shit that you only can get
On an oversea flight now
You scared of my heights now
But still, I got enemies giving me energy
I wanna fight now
Subliminal, sending me all of this hate
I thought I was holding the mic down
I thought I was holding my city up
I thought I was good in the media
You think I'm too hood in my video?
But really, no clue, you idiot
I just can't help myself
Even when that record spin
Every now and then, you hang yourself
'Cause I got the green and gold (With a million sold)
Plus plenty more, (and my dollar thicker)
But with or without the diamonds, though
(To you) I'm just another (Nigga!)
One two, one two, one two
One two, one two, one two
One two
Turn the headphones up Ali
One two
You mix with Dre, right?
Turn the headphones up
When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
That's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it
But I could never rewrite history in a coffin
So I'm talking to God, "Can you wash all these demons off me?"
This last year I've been quite similar to Aaliyah
Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered
A G5, g's give high-fives to me and say, "Kendrick, just persevere
The presence of being real"
As I lay in this four corner room staring at candles
Thinking, "How can I make an example for this generation of Compton?"
My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
Or turning back to that same accomplice
My past life was a child with no act right
Trying to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
Assuring that some blossom early and some truant
Thank God for the album I idolized
It's dark and plus hell is hot, that's the start of this crazy ride
Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage
And thought we was Jay and Dame
That's the lane that we tried to drive
Truthfully, I just started rappin' to get away
I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
My nigga got hit 25 times with a K
Make the decision, ride the beat or ride in a hearse
Now Punch is my mentor, Top Dawg is the coach
Jay Rock is my older brother, I was there when he wrote
His name on his record deal, we had figured the coast
Would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store
Found ourselves scrambling, tryna figure it out
Soul told me that the record shop 'bout to go in a drought
Q ain't got a place to stay and 'bout to sleep on the couch
We eatin' off each other tray, the dollar menu amount
Meanwhile the coast going hard at each other
The younger rappers had wanted some of the OGs' comfort
But I ain't need it
I never screamed out "the New West," I didn't believe it
They brought each other down, I was planning out my achievements
I need to separate myself to stand out
I need a better way to take your fans now
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
Three hollow tips aimed at your head
I'll be damned if the chopper jam now
And we never asked for no hand out
In the midst of it all I recall a call when you said how
We could never resolve in the hall of fame
And I went to the trial with a Bible and a rifle
I play the game as I blam blow
Hollaback at me, nigga
And if they said that I'm the one, why you asking me, nigga?
'Cause when the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David
And pray to God that ya make it or live your life in the matrix
'Cause falling off is a sickness, I heard that it's quite contagious
I need to separate myself to stand out
I need a better way to take your fans now
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
Three hollow tips aimed at your head
Whoever thought that Rosenberg would mention me to Dre?
Even Vanessa from XXL had told him press play
And there goes my fate, now I'm on stage with Snoop
Gave me the torch and I ran with it in high pursuit
Rapped with my forefathers, even record with Gaga too
Lyricist of the year, fuck am I supposed to do? Rock
Cool, 'cause niggas won't outdo us in the booth
Even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof
I came, I saw, I conquered
No shame, I blame all of this on Compton
Thinkin' 'bout when Sherane tried to set me up
Cold game, full circle, they set up her
I put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs
The fight to ignite any wrong or right that I prolong
The story was short film, the glory of him and them
The worry of mothers that don't recover when baby's killed
The trial and the tribulations, the newer Miseducation
The view of a body wasting, you knew somebody who ain't make it
The angry, the adolescent, the reason I ask this question
Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?
Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?
I'm the only nigga doin' it, you other niggas ruined it
I'm too legit, go Hammer wit' the foolishness
My nana said my grammar can maneuver this industry
Until I'm stupid rich and now I'm stupid rich, ah
(Even if she go away, even if she go away) A-woo-woo!
Assumin' this is what they humor is
To Pimp a Butterfly my newest shit
In fact the rumor is the way I proven it
(Classic man) That's on my mama though
I got piranha flow, fuckin' up your designer clothes
(Casket man) Where be your rapper's angle?
Bunch of subliminal bitches, I'd rather fingerbang 'em
Oh, ke-mo sah-bee, pray to God nobody try me
Catch a body over nothin, Top couldn't even stop me
I got key to my city, I got key to California
I might legalize your homicide and more marijuana
Let my daddy smoke his weed, only thing they keep me friendly
I ain't got no jewelry on me, bitch, I got the jewelry in me
Oh, shit, let me talk my shit, I always been the shit
This ain't overnight, they love me now like they loved me then
I know what I like, I eat the pussy for my nourishment
I know how to cherish it
I know how to decorate your wall and further furnish it
I'ma burn your shit down, this is what the furnace is
I'ma turn your shit around wit' some friendly services
Ain't no nervousness like I'm ratchet or conservative
And that's affirmative
All I do is lay-up and face up my big bills and pay stub
Got no chill for fake ones, like, for real, they say I'm...
(I'm a classic man) Even if she go away, even if she go away
(I'm a classic man) Even if she go away, even if she go away
I'm a classic man, old-fashioned man
Try it if it feels right (try it)
Try it if it feels right, yeah
When you try, oh, oh
I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three-on-one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss? Shit, don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said, "You do a song with Nip, K. Dot he a better Crip"
I said, "He a man first, you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?"
Level four, yard livin', given to false imprisonment
Listen close, my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
Since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication
If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
Hol' up
Pray to God, I wash my hand but I be damned
2012, 100 racks to Uncle Sam
A 24 year old millionaire
Don't read the contract 'less a mill in there
A1 credit, park my car bowlegged
I got a bus full of bitches, I call it Jay-rome Bettis
I grab my dick in the picture, your ho be cropping the image
I let you scrape off the dishes, we eating nigga, I'll finish
Then come right back, hope you insomniac
Sleep on me if you wanna take a dirt nap
Bitch I'm talking ca-ca-ca-ca then more ca-ca-ca-ca
Hit your roof until I pop your top up
Then more ca-ca-ca-ca, til I know I gotcha
Ballin like I'm baldin', then I see Jordan in the mirror
Nigga, that's flawless VVS, and CC text me, "What you wearing?"
Puttin my all inside your bitch, I grip her hips, that's power steering
About to hydroplane when I board that plane
And land inside the building
Itty-bitty bitch is a numerologist
Got your number where I live
I'ma get you outta pocket like a quarterback blitz
That's a everyday faucet, make it wet, make it rinse
Skeletons in your closet but your past don't exist
Got a pad on your list, got a pad on your lock
Calabas' ain't the move, that's where everybody live
Plus the mountain is hot, you forgot what you got, ah!
Hol' up, nuisance (I say it, I say it, I say it)
I recommend 'em all with acoustics (I say it, I say it, I say it)
I recommend a bed for the juices (I say it, I say it, I say it)
I recommend you live where the truth is (I say it, I say it, I say it)
Psychedelic views and infinity pools, yeah, checking out
Once I sweat them edges out
Hair down like vanity
I got the fuck-ups, I got the damage fees
I got the gold dust, I got the anesthesia
When you chose up, this ain't a fantasy
We 'bout to go up, see underhanding me never got no love
But understandin' me maybe can mold us and–
Cap on, and I got racks on
Spend four nights in a country I like
Then take my rich ass back home
Glow so bright, I could make moonlight
See this ain't like your pheromones
Blew one, big gun, baritone
Who won? We won, yeah, holmes
We old school like Capitol
My old school made doctor note
My old school made hard knock
Black on black, my coupe and strap
I ain't ballin' on the hard top, I told y'all to call Top
Now my number call blocked, I don't miss, I call shot
Hold up, yeah, cap on and I got racks on (And I got racks on)
And I produce that diesel, I could put Shaq on (I could put Shaq, ayy)
Nigga, your bitch gon' leave you, you ain't got backbone (You ain't got, hold up)
I don't rely on people, I just go and bread chase, whoa
This so fuckin' dope, I might catch a fed case, whoa
You ain't gettin' money, nigga, then you dead weight, whoa
Got the drop on 'em, there he go, checkmate, whoa
We go drop on 'em, y'all better play it safe, whoa
Right back in this bitch, take a flick, ho, what's happenin'? Yeah
We don't politic, money clip like it's fashion, yeah
Me and Rock go back like flippin' mattresses
Me and Dot go back like knockin' addresses
Cap on, cap on, drum hold thirty, no add-on
Lil' Man-Man not the one to go bad on
Big kickstand fold out when you lack on
You ain't no man, you a mouse in a rat hole
I hold band, whole stack, that's factual
Called Big Ten on a island bashful
Fuck your plan, I'ma burn that castle
Fuck that clan, I'ma burn that task force
It's sick murder when I say go
Hoppin' out that van with the black ski mask
And a great big burner when I say go
Man I took my chance in the paint like that
Let's see how further it might go
And it just might hurt you when I go
And my name might curse you when I go, bitch
God, we trust
Fear no man but in God, we trust
Both palm in hand, prayin' I stay up
I know you try your best but it's not like us, wow
Oh you say you got a bad one? Wow
I can tell you never had one, wow
We back to back actin' maney, wow
Eastside Johnny goin' stupid, stupid, stupid, wow
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?
I really want it - need it
Break bread - or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out "little Johnny is dead!" (oh you dead nigga)
You wish me well, I wish you Hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, sipped a gallon of it when you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
If my son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell it to meet me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass whoopin'
Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you
They couldn't
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?
I swear this industry shit, to me, is one big-ass lick
I walk inside of a buildin', tell the A&R nigga "strip"
Tell 'em I need all of my chips, my life been on Section 8
I've been a welfare case, AFDC pump fake
Meanwhile, I'm grindin' 'cause drug money ain't like rap money
Four white kilo, snow-bunny, equal one whole show, dummy
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, they killed Braze
They killed Chad, my big homie Pupp
Puppy eyes on my face, bruh
And I really be drinkin', why the fuck I really been smokin'?
What the fuck? I'm the sober one
Man, I'm so stressed out, I can't focus
Hide out when I ride out, ski mask with the eyes out
Speed past in the Cutlass, me and little Ocho
Every young nigga hop out
Two tears in a bucket, I feel like "fuck it"
The price of fame, recognize my pain, it's all I know
All out war but I'm out here though
Call my troops like, "vamonos"
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, and it's all bad
Off a OG with my OG and some OE by the tall glass
What's happenin', nigga?
Said nigga got this joint, nigga gon' get somethin' real, real nice, like
You gotta stop playin' me with that bullshit
Nah, I'm serious though, like, already checked it out, feel me?
Man, look, check this out, homie, I'm with the shits, man, you already know, what's happenin', what you tryna do?
Man, nigga tryna get paid, like, is you serious or is you playin'?
Nigga, is you serious, nigga? What's up, nigga? You know where I live at, nigga
Nigga I'm done straight 'bout to pull up, though, nigga, for sure, I'll holler
Aight, hold on, though
My nigga, this shit cool? You ain't tryna, you feel me, like?
Like, what's up, nigga?
Nah, you my nigga, cuz!
Fuck y'all want from me?
Y'all don't want money, y'all don't want from me
Y'all wanna die in the chase of things
We all gon' die and embrace the thing
Trapped inside a burnin' church
Made it out alive, God know my worth
Raw face, Scarface
Y'all face more defeat, I know it hurts
20 of 'em, 20 on call
Got 20 in my hand, got 20 on judge
Gave 20 to my dog, got 20 on girls
That'll fuck you to— (zoom zoom zoom)
That'll fuck you then fuck you over
Take your safe, take your keys, take your Rover
Take the heart you thought you had
Speed off, rollin' up life in a taxi cab
Opps on the radar (You're dead to me)

Come come now
Pac told me fuck the world, I'm 'bout to cum now
I've been a pro, but now I'm profound
Propane on posers, restraining from the doja
Imagine if I smoke, I probably come up with a quote
So heavy you'll forget every album you heard from Hova
Or 2pacalypse I'm Hub City's novelist
Come and get your scholarship, I'm taking kids to school
A pool full of spit, dive in, I'm 'bout to drool
You'll drown trynna backstroke on concepts that I wrote
I was a black sheep, but now I'm just a goat
And I'm 'bout to elope, married to the game joe
This is hip hop at its finest, where'd you find this? In a Ziploc
Til the wheels fall off, fuck a pit-stop or what not
Where my tear drop? I murdered it
My pot-holes is turbulence
I'm in the sky wit it
When you listening to Kendrick, just
Yo, turn me up some

Pop 'til it's vacant
Pop 'til the wrist pop
Pop 'til he shakin'
Pop like four on the floor been in rotation
No allegation
Popular demand, I understand my name is only for conversation
New York nigga be like "deadass"
L.A. nigga be like "on the dead homies"
I was off the porch like Fed-Ex
211, got bread on me
K-Dot twilight the zeitgeist
Roll like fried rice and tempura shrimp
Temporary pimp, nah, don't remember them
Just canary yellow gem, jumping out the fuckin' gym
Swang like new Dana Dane, I ride dirty
Paid like two Damon Wayans, retire early
Fade like shadows, the stallion, the cattle
A bitches decision for you, is narrow
Collision, the money, and fame, the pharaoh
The physic, the chemist, the lame
Collateral for Kendrick whenever exchange
Compatible for riches with more to gain
I said, nigga, yeah right
I don't fair fight but I bear fight
Lookin' for my next roadkill for the headlight
Hangin' on my last four kills for the highlights
My life, hiii life, high five, bye, bye
Nigga tell the world I’m Compton, Compton
Nigga, I’m Compton
Big ass condom, mothafuck ya problems
Make sure that you don’t bring ya man to my concert
I want you to suck my whole band after concert
Compton, Compton
Nigga, I’m Compton
Big ass condom, mothafuck ya problems
I’m killin’ every instrumental and I cosign em
And no 360 deals, see that's advance at McDonald’s
I spazz like a wino
Time and time again I often wonder where the time go, my daddy and my mom know
I stomp a rapper like a Kappa or beat him like a congo
Then speed off in a Bronco, OJ
Often reminisce about the old days, Hardaway/Alonzo
Back then we was wearing LA Gears with the rhinestones
Nowadays I’m coming headfirst like a rhino
I rhyme like I invented it my wordplay is unlimited
Now nigga spin my vinyl, club going apeshit
Rap like I ain’t ate shit, shit on any A-list
Artist you a novice I’m recording on a spaceship
And we never nodded to your sing-le, King K
D.O.T. is E.T.A. Primetime, new clothes
Closeminded niggas getting clotheslined, I suppose
Bitch I think I’m 2Pac
Bitch I think I’m B.I.G
Bitch I think I’m Eazy-E, I’m Big L and I’m ODB
And OMG I might OD, yeah that be my new tape
That’s appreciation tape, thanks for knowing that I’m great
Middle finger to the fake… FUCK YOU!
I’m the center of attention Hut 1, Hut 2
And my bitch a mutt too, mixed with all types of shit
Got the keys to her pad like I’m bout' to type and shitt
Got em all hype and shit, I ain’t even do nothing
Screaming out “fuck the world”, tell you when I’m through nutting
Compton, Compton
Nigga, I’m Compton
Big ass condom, mothafuck ya, momma!
I go inside the studio and suicide bomb ya!
I bomb on Obama if that nigga get in my way
I’m smelling some vagina, ya niggas some clitoris
Must be already dead, saying I ain’t killing it
I’m in the lead and winning it, feeling like a stunt double
I'm convinced we already in hell, pass the blunt devil
Ya talking Illuminati I’m talking eliminating
Everyone including Satan, Lord knows heaven waiting
I’m the best rapper alive!
I’m the best rapper alive!
I’m the best rapper alive!
Tell Wayne to swallow his pride
Ya niggas talking that jive
I’m talking that Malcolm X
Martin Luther hustles through ya ripping through ya fucking set
I’m the best rapper alive!
I’m the best rapper alive!
I’m the best rapper alive!
Jigga man should’ve retired
I’m going after Kanye, Lupe Fiasco, and Nas
Snoop Dogg and mister Andre, Eminem, Busta Buss Rhymes
Y'all better bust no more rhymes
I’ma start busting your ass
If you walk with a mac truck, then throw a bus on your ass!
Ya’ll be no action, no pass
We gon’ start busting on niggas
Choppers be bustin’ on niggas?
Chopper be bustin’ on niggas!
Fuck you and fuck you fuck niggas

You goddamn right, gotta big appetite with a big tapeworm every day I yearn another meal, I’m hun-gray
Give some to my ho-mays
Nigga we made men and cavemen, living in the stone age
I got this ignorant type shit, from my uncle Tony
And may my nigga rest in peace
From heaven, I know you see I’m Compton, Compton
Nigga, I am Compton
A big ass condom, mothafuck LAPD, DA, and your honor got pumped up on Alondra
Trap my body, free my mind
Hoping ya’ll could see the sign
I live this life at a pace that anyone can go
Know your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones
And I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sew
I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a Jag
A car for my dogs, with a roof full of glass
But still I be feeling like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that, I'm not worried, even when it's scary
Skrrt off makin' them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry
Dirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon is gone is burried
Shirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic 'cause rats is what I'm talking about
I'm hearin the sonics of gun fire
The whispers, the silent cries
Even though I know it's an eye for an eye
Often I'm caught up in confusion in tryna find solutions
To try and pimp the system that's a form of prostitution, I'm ready
The city probably see me as a nuisance, deadly
Singing the Devil's song in a repetitive medley, I know
But shorty fire and she admire that I'm a pyro
Maniac, I said "Where you at, and do you have Geico?
I need insurance that you could sex me the best."
And she started sexting through texts
And sent pictures under her dress
Got them G-Strings, she beasting for the pleasure and pain
I was a weakling, so I cling to her under my name
Gave her the ding-ding, then "ding ding," the bell ringing again
It was intriguing that she seen, don't no stand
No flow, keeping it wet, making it rain
Beg your pardon, don't blowjob, she no jobs like Tommy from Martin
The blowjobs, she blow hard like a Nintendo cartridge
That blowjob had genius like Mozart
Got blowjob, then put it in her trunk like Goyard
I'm starting off with that Cuevo
Shop on Rodeo, house in the Dagos
We like to fuck and watch the day go by
Hasta luego, drop the potato
She's hot, what can I say, yo?
Ahh, shit! Recognize what lives inside these eyes
I'ma ride until the dead has risen
Live in a project building, dodgin' the module ceilings
I ride, I'ma ride in a stolen Jeep
Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted)
Mama tried counselin', five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it)
My family's ties, had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (Abducted)
My aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (Disgusting)
Our stadium's packed, Raiders in black
Curls drippin', silver bullet, palladium in my strap
I lie on the side of a one way street
Nowhere to go, death all I can see
I say "Fuck is up?", I fuck 'em up
Your supper's up or something's up
I hoping all get orthotist, rope it before the double dutch broke
Plenty records with this weapon, I protect it under oath
My discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life
Fuck your hope, fuck your mama
Fuck your daddy, fuck your dead homie
Fucked the world up when we came up, that's Compton homie!
Murder, murder
Murder... murder
It's all murder... murder
Ahh!
Murder, murder, murder, murder
It's been a 187 in this bitch!
Uh, every time I’m in my city, I be acting like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' Me Against the World—hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan
Bounce-bounce ho, bounce-bounce
This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
Or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich
Pull up on these 26’s, I’m a vanity slave
I’m a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
I’m a Comp-town representer, a concrete back-flipper
A.K.A that nigga, don't wuwwy!
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
This is HiiiPower, since the Eddie Bauer I been popular
I’m popping now, every other hour paparazzi come
You jocking her, let her be a ho, why you stopping though?
We stopping the traffic, what you know 'bout them hockey pucks?
Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em
Seen too many of y’all getting money, know my turn coming
I don’t know why your bitch wanna fuck me
I don’t know why (Hey, wait a minute, motherfucker)
Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Ridin' 'round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
The only thing I did wrong was make it possible
I diddy bop and make them titties pop
Out there on my bumper like a city cop
Walking out the Fred Segal, put my girl on it
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it (Aye)
Pussy crazy, pussy crazy
You fuck niggas, you pussies crazy
Man, I know I can’t tell you about the world homie
But I know I can tell you about your girl homie
Her pussy crazy, her pussy crazy, I fuck nigga, I know you hate me
I know they pay me too much of attention
Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned
I need me an engine that go real fast
Call it hall of fame once it haul ass
Give me tall glass, Coconut Cîroc
Please, no soda pop, I make my solo pop
Life’s a bitch, her pussy crazy
But I make that pussy pay me
Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these hoes, Wayne told me that…
Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink

Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes

Seasons change
There's still time for us to run away
Seasons change
There's still time for us to run away
Seaso—
I am T'Challa, I am Killmonger
One world, one God, one family
Celebration
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?"
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again
Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards 'cause, papa, they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night, hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, "The Devil is a lie, make a better choice"
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, "Is there really a God?"
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again
I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is
Think about it
The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing
Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing, real talk, and
This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, ya know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like "hol' up"
"Where you from?" I don't bang
"Where you stay?" Westside, that's a Piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said, "fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you"
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but
This is why they fuck with me (I told you, nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, you know?
This is why they fuck with me (haha)
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
So there you have it
But I'mma leave you with this
An O.G. once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone
Pull up in bitch shit and I'm beamin' and shit
Hundred hoes, hundredfold, this my season and shit
Stomach on belly roll, bitch, I'm eatin' and shit
You a vegan and shit, get off my penis and shit
Look a bad bitch, I bag that, bitch nigga, back-back
Pull it out the grab bag, turn this ho to Baghdad (it's the world)
Bags on my eyes, I don't sleep much, we up
Bitch, I beat the beat up, the homies get you beat up
And R.I.P. to P-Nut, Little Eric, bick back
Mausberg, 4 Bent, Compton I live that (yeah)
Long hair weave with extensions (yeah)
Glock 17 with extension
Bumpin' Suga Free in the automatic dually
T.V.s in it like it's '97, watch a porno movie
Holla Chitty Chitty Bang, this is Comp-Town gang
Fuck whoever don't like it, lil' K-Dot be the name, bitch (let's go)
You're like a needle in a haystack
I wanna sit you where my face at
Lunch with a few Mai-Tais
Purple kisses on my tie
Life can leave a dick loved
Now you gettin' this dick, love
I'm lookin' for you with a flashlight
I wanna feel what a real fat ass like
No injection, I learned my lesson
I walk it like I talk it, baby this pedestrian
Runnin' through your mind like Jackie Joyner
Pussy like pop, go give me a burner
Got shot like pop
This can be detrimental
T-shirt and panties, that's your credential
You're cotton candy, I need a fistful
I'm often antsy, hope that convince you
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch

(Sherane)
Aw man... where is she taking me...
Where is she taking me...
All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me
Making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep, and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough
More, more, bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more
Gloomy on sunny days, shadows no house or trees
Prayers not close to me as I bow down and take a knee
Hell goes far as the eye can see, hoodies and weaponry
Naive to being free, locked up, we chasing keys
How your eyes investigate us, while we look up to entertainers
Ball players, pistol bangers, big brothers, uncles, uncles
Betrayed by a lot of homies, all my friendships stay on shuffle
Huddles, steady find a plan, spread evil beyond the land
As I clench down upon this trigger, the burn fucking burn
Every step to getting deeper, survival my main concern
Marinating in Satan's sweat, take a sip of this holy water
Hoping God still keep me blessed, with a dark shield for my armor
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life

Promises, man, I promised, none of them goals accomplished
Promises, man, I promised to be loyal and honest
Promises, man, I promised, lied on separate occasions
Promises, man, I promised, my promises is aging
Hennessy what my system like, feeling like Superman
I might crip tonight, I bring loss to life
A gruesome site, look who don' got involved
It's no different from wars, it's kill or be called upon
Feeling teary eyed, thinking I've gone too far
Ask God for forgiveness, shit I doubt he heard me at all
They say clean your hands before you eat, rinse your sins with prayer
But I've done did some things I don't think I could ever wash away
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Woo, woah
Woo, woah

I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils. There is an even more important topic I'd like to discuss: the dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan Era. Young men that learned to do everything spiteful. This is your generation. Live fast and die young. Who's willing to explain this story?

Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...
I’ve been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at '95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion
Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancin'
Howling at the moon, what’s a pack of hungry babies?
Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
But never make the visit, if better days was on its way
Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
Oh yeah, I remember that, it- it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Am I right?
Spend it all in front of the county building
Oh!
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building

Nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?
Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety (Uh-huh)
Played the passenger I think it’s five years after eighty (Yeah, yeah that)
Seven, do the math, ‘92, don’t you be lazy (I won't)
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental
Insurance ‘cause we ‘bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar but, shit, not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi, I want them Kenwood woofers
Say that you got me, if not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bulls' eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
"Papa, you really telling me we can just get some more of it
If we run out?" He said, "Lil' nigga, today the poor is rich
Don’t tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don’t forget
Bitches ain’t shit, hoes ain’t neither
Niggas gon' snitch, watch the company you keeping
And one day you’ll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots"
That- that’s right the mothafuckin’ Rodney King...
You was with your daddy on Bullis Road
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
That's crazy
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
Don't forget, still sing along kids, still sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Please sing
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
"Gina, baby, I don't have no money, I don't have no ends
Gina, I'm ass-out"
"I'm going through something right now!"
"I done told you that"
Oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
Well alright...

Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then, I had no job
Pushing in my momma van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for somethin my cousin prolly did
Guilty by association: story of my life, nigga
You gon make me flip and split yo shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, Uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go, drenched my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin, margin
Maintaining my modest modus as I dream
So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
Life itself, I know what helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry
("Hey what's up daddy?")
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
"So what'd you rush me out here for?
How was your day? Are you tipsy?"
"Mhm!"
All I need in this lifetime: Pussy and Patrón
Give me that, once you give me that, once again it's on
Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby momma what it do?
Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is?
Go on poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready
I'mma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me...
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough, if I offend you, blame it on the liquor babe
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough if I offend you...
Uh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home
And caught that flat, in the mean T Flats
And it made me think if we could blink
To change locations where we at
We often get lost in the alcohol bottle
In attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
Your car note due and you 'bout to get evicted
Two drugs surely, Patrón, pussy, make it feel alright
But once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life
You can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
The antidote wouldn't last and you knew it, nigga
But still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright

How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready

(Gunshot)
On and On
On and On
On and On
On and On
Back when my driver's license, was baby faced and triflin'
I made my way through crisis, I made my tape
And recorded portraits in front of sirens, I made you hate the vibrant
You can't escape the tyrant, you can't relate where I've been
In '98 my problem, actin' too grown and shit
Cappin' at bitches, yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga, you are not the homie
Bitch I’m well-connected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin' with Tetris if your block neglectin' your ki
Everyday I wake up with my face up to my father
Makin' sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest
All my king is stuffin', double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality, my déjà vu done caught up
Bitch I'm brought up with the homies, that's on me
24/7, Kendrick revvin' these cold streets
Don't we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate
And if Game told me, "Drive by it," I raise AK
Ain't no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, I'll play
Like no name on it, blindsided, ain't no one safe
Documentary had identities of where I'm from
Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won
It ain't no better one, son, it ain't no tellin' me nothin'
Nigga that's Chuck, Doc Dre and K, the legacy's done, BLAOW!
Oh man, you thought these niggas with attitude would show gratitude
Fooled you
From 2015 to infinity it's still bomb weed and Hennessy
I can pimp a butterfly for the energy
Game I need acapella
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga you are not the homie
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga you are not the homie
I tell 'em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrectin' my vengeance
Been dissectin' your motormouth, 'til I break down the engine
This ain't no warnin' shot, this a relevant henchman
See my opponent, then — cease your existence
Endin' our friendship, baby, I'd rather die alone
Your diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin' on?
Capture your audience with these words, boy
The holy Chapel, the tabernacle, the book of Matthew
And Jesus starin' at you, take your turn, boy
See? It's gon' take a whole lot of y'all to kill me
See? It's gon' take a whole tribe of y'all to kill me, I never die
My pedigree apparently only to idolize
Ahead of me is only my future and idle time
Longevity, I gotta get used to makin' you mine
You tellin' me I only get used to livin' if fine
You can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from God
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive
Toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin
Every nation Obama nation, let the coroner in
Crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men
Just embrace it and die alone, song of Revelation
Reverends and cattles racing
Devils and demons and Deuteronomy
Fumigate our economy, 'lluminate broken dreams
And manifest all insanity, look around
Sayonara tomorrow, it's just blood on the ground
Uh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin'
Invest in your future, don't dilute your finances
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?), 4.2%
Thirty year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings
And you'll retire with money in your account
Beast!
One time, reporting live, Compton, California
She go to work, she go to school, her body smooth, no tattoos
Type of girl that’ll make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too, she’s compatible, she’s independent
She handle her business, she believe in God and no other religions
She's never in competition, when it comes to her friends, she's dependable
She set her own trends, a confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor, look at her hips, I want to be her pager
Conservative, affirmative, actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
Five years later, an accounting major, work at a firm
Abundance of paper, she got a career, she look in the rear
View mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Call her boss, executive meetings, consecutive trips, vacational weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress, probably the only product of her pure success
Got a promotion, now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building, real estate, property
She order tender steak, only one mouth to feed, funded a youth center
Invested in some stock, doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl, how great life can be, even though she got the world, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be, and though she got the world, she needs me
We lose touch, separated, years pass, I’m outdated
She’s dating one of Hollywood’s famous entertainers, Denzel good
Paparazzi spot ‘em out shopping, Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's
Tabloids paint a picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads when a famous actor loves you, Emmy Awards, Academy too
On the red carpet, dress matching his suit, she holding his arm
She waves at her moms and wave at the world, got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds, star gazing, caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
He bent down, got on one knee, she looked him in the eye and said she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Even if we seem to separate, eventually it’ll come to pass, and she’ll need me
I need her, we need we
Uh
A lil' Compton nigga
Just a lil' Compton nigga
One time for my niggas
You know Compton, nigga
Just a lil' Compton nigga
Kendrick Lamar
Back with a vengeance
Back with my heart and I'm venting
Back with another war pendant, salute me or shoot me
I never wore a kufi, ignore my religion
I believe there's one God, there's one love
And I believe if I fly, we all doves
I make a way for my people to see the light
Brighter than yellow bones
Me and my microphone could be one
Until I see BIG, Pac, see Pun but this ain't Eazy
I can't take a Big L, my city needs me, I gotta win
The proof is in the pudding
And I been fucking with Cosby since I was ten, you damn right
By any means necessary get campaign right
Very emotional I'm a Gemini, I love hard and I fight harder, a born author
A born starter, in the game for real
And the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father
You can't learn if mistakes ain't made
You gotta pay homage in order to get paid
You gotta pay attention in order to pay dues
And you ain't gettin' it, 'til you start payin' Jews
Lifestyles of the young and the broke
With my hand under oath, I recite these quotes
And if I ever lie then I die where I stand as a pest not a man what I wrote through a rap
In order to see the front, I had to play the back
We played our position, we let ya'll play ya'll selves, ya'll made ya'll decision
We pray while we prey on competition
To flip another page of Corinthians
I see stars when I write these sentences
Words crash cars when I write these sentences
Open jail bars for my niggas life sentences
Free J-Dove, kill all witnesses
Ya'll better hope 2012 really real, cause the way I feel I'mma make ya'll suffer
And take ya'll supper
I haven't ate in the last 22 summers and I'm 22 now it's about to go down
So en garde, my God we got these artists in awe
Oh, I'm free
Finally I can say I'm me
The Kendrick Lamar EP, classic EP
The question concerns
I dropped it and gave the whole world my germs
Hope ya'll infected
Hope ya'll ain't have no protection
Still I'm progressing, room for improvement
Make room for the groom married to his music
I was at the XXL just trying to excel
Networking, meanwhile my stomach turning
Wanted to be apart of it cater it to my audience
J. Cole runnin' late
If he don't show up, think I can take his place
Ladies start laughing
No pun intended I ain't being sarcastic
Homie popped up with about twenty bags and
Fresh out the plane I couldn't even complain
My nigga was on his hustle I introduced him my name
Said I'll see him on the bubble in the future, my dude I salute ya
Contributing the real shit
Talk about it make the people talk about it
Make the world see, for every MC that I see tryna stay afloat
Tell 'em build a boat like Noah
And take him to a place that I'm sure we all can blow up, boom
I ain't a star yet but I'm gettin' close to em
And if you see a whack artist do more than boo him
Throw him off the banister, shoot him on camera
Then kill his manager
Then hang a banner up, that reads you can't proceed without bein' conceived by one album of the 90's
On Rosecrans where you'll find me
And all my niggas is grimy
But I remain the good kid
Tryna make a difference where I'm from, where you live
Oh no we got to slow the city down
I told the homeboy pump his brakes
He said that he rather put the pump to his face
Sawed off
Torture, turn the saw off, its scorchin'
Hot where I'm from, the newscasters don't come
Another ratchet got dumped, in the trashcan I ain't done
A baby in there with it
She said postpartum did it
Molested at eleven and she always reminiscing
When he was undressing said it'll only be a minute
That's why I always think I'm kicking something with feeling
I should've been a dentist
I should've been a blizzard-cold
Flash, pose, flash, pose, a critic paparazzi got me on my toes
I wanna jump on him like a tad-pole, tad-pole, ass-holes
Tryna kill my dreams
Not elevate
Those are not my dreams, I'll be straight
With a little bit of passion
And a drive like an Aston
Motivation from Nipsey or Glasses, Jay Rock
Mykestro , Bad Lucc, U-N-I
Dom Kennedy, Murs and Fashawn
Lady G, Willy B in time
Ima blow like I'm mothafuckin' sniffing lines
Go like I never seen a red light shine
Flow to my heart, hit the flo' when im dying
Heart of a lion, tell em get in line
And pass the baton, I won't pass it back I ain't good at dimes
If the bitch bad I could pass you a dime
Haters better duck like I'm passing a pond
Know I'm the king and I'm passing you pawns
Pad on the hill (as in a big house on the hill) that's a passion of mine
Problem is I shine like two mics under heavy strobe lights
I'mma need two mics just to get my point across
I'mma get my joint across, country ya'll gon' want me
Vete al carajo y mámame la tota
Two wrongs don't make us right away
Tell me something's wrong
Party all of our lives away
To take you on
(We go)
High up, high up, high up, high up
High again, high again
High again, high again
High up, high up, high up, high up
High again, high again
High again, high again
You probably think a nigga trollin’ (Like)
Or showin' out for the cameras (Right)
Fuck I'm doin' fish-bowlin’? ('Side)
One hunnid thou' on the passenger
Bitch, I'm Kendrick Lamar, respect me from afar
I was made in His image, you call me a god
Everybody in attendance, I'm about to perform
Everybody get offended by the shit I got on
Like, can you buy that, nigga?
Nine hundred horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?
I need tints so I can look at the snakes and posers
(I need tint) 'Cause bomb head is non-disclosure
(I need tint) So I can live with a peace of mind
Without niggas takin' a piece of mine
And peace be still and not do fines, so fuck a fix-it ticket
You pull me over and might see one of your bitches, ahh!
Hol' up...but don't forget about Compton, nigga!
One for the money, two for the show
Three for No Limit and the rest for Death Row
That means I been 'bout it 'bout it and this is the realest shit I ever wrote
And if anyone ever doubt it then they are the loudest of liars I know
I only desire to blow, she only desire to blow
And I hope that my dick is a whistling flute, and that's not the instrumental
Now pick up my coat
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul, I'll drag your ass to the floor
Bitch, I can admit, I'm a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
Telling the doctor I'm sick, head doctor I'm needing your lips, yeah
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it then I won't ignore it, clear
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right when I floor it that's when I switch gears
Living my life on Uranus, uh, keeping one foot in your anus, uh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til I break it, uh
Bitch I'm demanding respect, these bitches is telling me take it
DJ Khaled, even if I had callus, holding the torch ain't no challenge
Ain't it?
I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time
Anything that can get me outta my mind
I'm a rolling stone that needs another home, especially
(When loves runs high)
I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time
Anything that can get me outta my mind
I'm a rolling stone that needs another home, especially
(When loves runs high)
I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time
Anything that can get me outta my mind
I'm a rolling stone that needs another home, especially
(When loves runs high)
(When the love runs high)
(It's-)
I gotta break your fuckin' heart
I gotta climb these fuckin' charts (I gotta climb 'em)
I gotta do something that's innovative, creative just to create a
Legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia's momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty of Carne Asada
I gotta, I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got a, I got a fine, 'cause I ain't wanna vote
I promise, I know the history of those who died
For the rights for me to survive, but those who lied
To the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt
The youths need to know every detail about this Earth
The devil controls it, so before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important, the end is near
Oh what up, ho? Oh, what up?
I said oh, what up, ho? Oh, what up?
I said oh, what up, ho? Oh, what up?
Well, alright
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then I had no job
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life, nigga
You gone make me flip then split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louis's Burgers
Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin's margin
Maintaining my modest, modest as I dream
So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry
Hey, whats up daddy
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I said keep reading my diary, when my life's entirely
Surrounded by the irony of living in the city
I said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat
And the only thing can help is ass and some titties
So what's up, baby? I said what's up?
I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills
Credit card late fees, Capital One popping up on my caller ID
Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow-tip shots
Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
Man that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear
You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
Scared to hit your emergencies cause then they'll be on it
See I know when the harsh reality take its toll
Open up your contacts then scroll
Hey, whats up daddy
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
Yesterday, my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that, his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before, he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
Two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent ’cause he lost his job
A month before that, he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that, her mother said she won't see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges was brought up
I shook my head, turned around, then found a hundred dollars
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me

Yesterday, I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that, my partner had fronted me a zone
A week before, I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that, I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that, I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that, I hit my woman, she hit the floor
I stormed out, then seen a black Honda Accord
Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceilin'
Closed my eyes, then asked myself how I was feelin'
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willin'?
I came to grips, jumped up, looked out the window
See my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this was meant for
Me to give them a hundred dollars then trash my pistol
Now I know why He keep blessing me
Now I know why He keep blessing me
Now I know why He keep blessing me
Now I know why He keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why

She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)
She got me going, I'm all in
Fifty stories, I'm falling
Where you been? Is it planet Mars?
Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
You're unfamiliar but still, I feel ya
Energy sending me towards the ceiling
I'm high now, are you up there?
If you was, I would climb every other stair
I gotta stare, I mean wow
And I'm wowed, no one compares
A one-on-one, you must have won
Every pageant in America when you was young
Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop...
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)
So now we on, so now we going
Living in the city of the unknown
I show her off, I stunt with her
We do it sweet, they look bitter
Look at her get up, I hear 'em say
But why him? I hear 'em hate
I laugh at it rather than jab at it
Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
'Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug
Cold turkey? No sir
You gotta be an Odyssey from heaven and above
You definitely know, probably I gotta give it up
Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop...
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)
You something different, I'm glad I found you
So pretty, I'll never do anything to hurt you
Talk about it, make 'em talk about it
Life to me is currency, prosperity, I got it
And your life to me is lifeless like it's livin' on life support
I license everything in my wallet
Lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga, play yo' part or parallel park yo' ego
Next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it
Or, better yet, forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac with a MAC in the back of a 'Lac
With a latch on the back of the trunk
Hit a punk in the back with a pump in the back till he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future
When you are mentioning talent
And I'm back in the back of the block
With a cop wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block, he watch with a block or whatever
And cut, no cut, mo' guns, mo' guts, fuck boy
You fucked up twice, you fucked considerin' you drownin'
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish, backflip head-first smilin'
Cr—cry in the face of Jesus, we just pray we keep on stylin'
On you bitches, TDE, YMCMB big business, bitch!
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain’t no pain I can’t withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil’ nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
To thanking God I’m in a whole ‘nother tax bracket
Amen
It's been a week already, feeling weak already
Got me at peak, possibility of what could be
Situation is heavy, I've got to prove
On February 26th I lost my life too
It's like I'm here in a dark dream
Nightmare, hear screams recorded
Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was
That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood
Why didn't he defend himself? Why couldn't he throw a punch?
And for our community do you know what this does?
Add to a trail of hatred
2012 was taped for the world to see
Set us back another 400 years
This is modern day slavery
The reason why I'm by your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your son jumped in your arm
Cut off the engine then sped off in the rain
I'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk
Had the vodka on the top
How come I can long time
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
See I'm living with anxiety
Giving up sobriety
Cussing with his sister
And playing with society
Justice ain't free
Therefore justice ain't me
Try and justify staying, obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinking to myself
Hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinking by myself
At the end of Section Park
Caught you when you walk besides your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your spine drip to your arm
Cut off the engine then sped off in a wraith
I said Hiiipower, one time you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Hiiipower, two times you see it
Conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us
Uh, go
Uh, go

Pour up this 1942, it knock me on my...

Nigga gotta hit the golf course to get a peace of mind
Family friends want a piece of mine
I can tell they all piecin' up
And I can show 'em where peace resides
Since eight years old, I knew I'd be rich
'Cause the college route, it wasn't 'bout shit
Tried the honest route, but chose house licks
Tried to lock me up, but can't catch this
Now where we touch down is on my X list, I'm on a fresh tip
Too much time of livin' reckless
Now add that time up on my left wrist
Lil' rappers ain't impressive (Ain't impressive)
Your tax bracket ain't impressive (Ain't impressive)

All that bullshit I taught her, huh
Way too blessed to be normal, uh
Upper echelon, where we stand at

'Cause the school system won't teach that
Where your father been, you gon' reach that
Too many M's to make (To make)
Too many rules to break (To break)
Too many fightin' that case (That case)
I gotta find my way (My way)
Daughter need new shoes (Shoes)
If I lose, she lose (Lose)
And I ain't gettin' used to losses
I'm goin' off 'til I crash
Fuck all the opps, I kid you not, see we gon' crash
My thoughts is sick, I don't have no sense, sometimes I crash
Pour up this 1942, it knock me on my...
It knock me on my...
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game
Keep these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change
Q I wanna see you do your thang
Entertainment business living limelight
Hop on every track and move them trains
Show these motherfuckers that you been tight, then they ever been
Its evident that you intelligent but you can't escape that life
And for you my nigga
I would sacrifice myself to make it just to see you hold the mic
And hit the stage and rock the set
But its hard to change when your from the sect
Won't you think about it nigga, life or death
Life of crack I’d like to hang you by the neck
Do you wanna see the boys in jet, or you wanna see them run way jets
Fly to Singapore one way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
Swear to god, its hard out here for a young black men to live
If you dont do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids
My nigga won't you tell Michelle, I love your daughter
Please dont let her grow up life without a father
Look at what you bought her, money couldn't buy
All she need is love, put that shit aside
At the same time know they got to eat
Know you got to hustle, make ends meet
Gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HGC, no a.c
And the block hot, you keep runnin', cop say freeze
Blue pill, red pill, choose now, birds or the beez
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game
Keep these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change
Count my change
Count my change
Man, Beyoncé, I'm mad at you
Man...
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinkin' about the good times before she met Jay
See ya know
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so
I remember you were 16 on the TV screen with Wyclef
Were you my type? Oh God yes, I was impressed
You was like "no no no," I was like 12 years old
Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you were on the road
You wore braids with a bangin body
Look like you did pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
But bump that, I was there from the start
Even when Latoya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
Hope you didn't cry cause honestly they were just so-so
They couldn't sing anyway, you deserve to go solo
No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle I'm just sayin' they cool
But you? You are somethin' like Wonder Woman
And I just wanna hold your hand, bring you to Compton
Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand
Eatin hot cheetos with pickle juice in it
Put that napkin down, you know I'll lick your fingers when you're finished
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinkin' about the good times before she met Jay
See ya know
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so
I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD
Gazed at the cover for a whole 5 minutes until my girlfriend hit me
She jealous of you cause I don't love her like I love you
I even make her do the "uh oh, uh oh" just like you do
She tell me I'm obsessed, I tell her we connect
Like Ice Cube way before the Mac 10 feud
She's like "you goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke"
I said "So? I'm only 500 mill away, theres still hope!"
Anyway, I had feelings even way before you got paid
And I didn't laugh when you busted your ass on the stage
And I salute Kanye for takin' up for you
I would've stole the award just to prove that I love you
But Jay should've did that I thought he had your biz-ack
What happened, Mr. Izzo? Hopico? Fredrico?
He used to be my favorite until he abandoned my diva
Now I tell everybody Nas had killed him on "ether"
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinkin' about the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
Hopefully I still have a chance
Maybe if I sabotage your man
You never know, hmm...
I'mma sneak backstage at a Mary J Blige concert
With an "I love Mary" shirt, then find Jay-Z
And push him into a dancer, hopefully they lock lips
That's when I yell out "Sounwave! Hurry up take the pic!"
Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
Publicity like that? Yep, they'd be sure to fight
Better yet, I'mma steal her cell, then call up Affion
He impersonates Jay well, get Beyonce on the line
Then make up some bogus shit like "You don't rub the back of my knees right
So this marriage is over with
And the ring thats on my finger? Guess what? I'm throwin' it!
Haha that should get 'em
That should break em up like a Kit Kat when I do that, yeah, true that
I'mma put the plan in motion, that's for sure
But if I end up with Macy Gray, this plan never work
Yeeeea, man I hope Jay don’t be mad at me bout this song
Start-ay, Wizzle start me back from like the first verse
Like right before I come in
Haha, what you say? Nah, you think it’ll be hot for real though?
Nigga, you stupid, they probably laughing as hard as you
Nigga got the best wife in the world and shit
Run that back though?
September 22nd, 2009
Kendrick Lamar
To... to...
Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you
Scared of you but I will fight you
I stare at the ceiling and think about you
Curiosity killing me, thinking of when I'ma meet you
You introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers, children and babies drive me crazy I wonder
Why you love people that love people that do right?
Is it rocket science to you or is it just your type?
One of my biggest fears, is waking up 4 in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers
Or maybe a family member that you thought was cool
Or maybe a person that I'll never meet 'cause of you
You, son of a bitch and I wish you never existed
And I swear I'd blow your brains out if you pay me a visit
But that's not realistic, 'cause you'll never rot
But I'ma still send this letter off
P.O. Box, and when you get it....
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal
Let me continue this letter saying I don't like you
Scared of you but I will fight you
Should be ashamed of the moves you make
The pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break
Everyday you remind me that you're always there
'Cause every time I come around someone's getting shot down
And all I say is a prayer, "so help me, Lord!"
Then the Lord talk back, "I can't help you, boy!"
That's fucked up, my life's fucked, was cursed before birth
And what's fucked up, I gotta live my life with the hurt
Of knowing that you're everlasting
Dwelling upon the masses
Of the Earth fatal assassins
Snatchin' bodies
Probably, on my notepad as I write
Why the fuck you wanna take my life?
Sooner or later, I'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor
So when I write on this paper
It's real talk
So...
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal
Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you too
And the reason we haven't met because I've been busy doing whatever since grade school
I've watched your every move
You slipped up a few times, I gave you a pass
So don't say I ain't sympathetic
But you can barely get curiosity, I'ma dead it
Everybody wanna know why I act this way
Let's just say... I had a bad day
Matter fact, everyday
But I take it out on somebody and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade
I was born to be a killjoy, I'm an old brat
Conceived by Adam and Eve, so who you mad at?
Not me, see me? I'm just doing my job
And you ducking me? Is mos def an odd
So why send this letter as if I never knew you?
I rather knock on your door and just hand it to you
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me
Cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
Fell into lust, where is the love?
My independency got tendencies of lack of trust
I look at the street corners as my new woman
Seductive as she want to be, hands all on my garments
And luckily, being in denial ain't the case
Cause I know she's unfaithful
Instead I'm grabbing her waist
And every part of her is tasteful
I know you're feelings hating
In fact, you think I'm ungrateful.. I know
Selfish as I wanna be and every time you under me
I get the vibe you might need some time to grow
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me
Cause I been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
And every time that I think of your touch
Adrenaline pump, give me that rush
I'm going like a thief inside the wind
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know she want me more, but I fiend for benjamins
She said I found the root of all evil
And lost a friend
Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton
That never knew love because love was never promised
I know.. selfish as I wanna be
And every time I'm under you, me too
Need time to grow..
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me
I want it, I want it, I want it-it-it-it
Chilly, chilly, chilly, chilly (Yeah, what?)
Wake up, Count Chilly (What?)
I'm up, Count Chilly (Up)

Fall off in this bitch, I ball off in this bitch
My commas hit the floor, you crawl off in this bitch
I threw a hundred more, you stall off in this bitch
And then I vámonos, applaud me in this bitch
C-notes, B-notes, P-notes all up in this bitch
Man, y'all not in this bitch, y'all are not familiar
Y’all are immigrants, the law not in this bitch, I
Fuck the opp, no competitor
Got into it with my bitch last night
She was right, but I had to get at her
Two popped bands and they dance on my waist
Hit the face, that’s the editor
I don't take pics on a jet, lil nigga
This shit regular, G5s all in my backyard
Sit you roody-poos in the nosebleed
Now my pockets holding big protein
Big, big protein (Protein)
I leveled up past Fab Five
Your favorite rapper Desperate Housewives
Playin’ with me get you chastised
Milk 'em all 'til I'm satisfied
They didn’t fall for it, strategize
Switch the flow 'cause they know niggas like identity theft
Oh, you got like me? (Say less)
Oh, you pop like me? (Say less)
Mask keep a nigga (In check)
Huh, swag keep a nigga (With checks)
Huh, tags on my wall (Success)
Huh, played the underdog, now flex (Now flex)
Chilly (Chilly), chilly (Chilly), chilly (Chilly), chilly (Chilly)
Wake up, Count Chilly
I'm up, Count Chilly
Tell my mama I hit a lick (Lick)
Tell my mama I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick
Mama, I hit a lick
Ah, I parted ways with my old self, I'm a new man
New face with a new stone and the blue van
Blew weight on a bad day with my loosie
Suitcase full of merchandise, that's my new plan
This my new wave, this my new tan
This my summer days in the tropics by the cool sand
This my shakin' down you niggas' pockets, I don't do friends
And I don't do trends
Fuck it though I'll ride with you then!
Bring the troops in
I'll fuck around and let 'em loose then
We'll give 'em blues then
Oh fuck it, call me Bobby "Blue" Bland
Aye you a fool man
Ridin' by you, swervin' at the intersection
Baby come and get your blessin'
And she gon' fuck with this erection
I got somethin' good for all these hoes
She gotta want the Betty 'fore I call these hoes
Now if I paid for your dress and your perm
That means you an investment, bitch
I'ma need my dough in return
We reporting live from the 9 double 0-5-9 with my nigga Jay Rock and this is WTOP Radio and I'm your host DJ Turn-Up
I don't turn down nuttin' but my collar
I ain't turnin' down no money
And I ain't turnin' down no mothafuckin' fade
Now bitch if you're pushin' up the freak with your orangutan-lookin' ass, take some advice and bang SZA ya flat-foot bitch
You better duck, run fast from the mania
Don't stare, don't laugh at the media
Brake free, press gas when it enter ya'
Don't let it go bad when he ante up
Highway, get out the way
Black man do your great escape
Pac-man wanna prosecute you
Raise your hand up, and they'll shoot ya'
Face off, face off Adolf Hitler
Grandkids slayed off
Niggas, same rules, same chalk
Different decade, same law
Keep focus, you wanna get caught with your eyes open
You wanna stay clear of the prognosis
Pride provoked him, watch demotion
Watch em' close enough
Don't let the holster break or roast ya'
Rollercoaster ride that bitch
Soon or later sides gon' switch
You know Johnny got that itch
How many more of us gotta see the coroner?
Slain by the same badge, stop, wait, brake, fast!
Said I'm a fuckin' monster
A massive attack, I haunt ya'
I mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors
Mastered that after that I went for thermometers
Popped 'em all, then popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica
Holla back they promised us
No pajamas insomnia
Will attack, I attack like piranha does
Hit your block like a comet (Blah!)
And you all know what time it is
2012, mark your calendars calisthenics and silencers exercisin' that trigger strap
Rock with us, Metallica, competition no talented
I'm in a jungle what's wild enough
Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
No lyin' my soldiers dyin' this is Iraq
Alliances lining with stars and bars of a prison rep
My science applyin' pressure, her stretcher is needed, pay the proceeds
Or your livin' debt y'all soft as a giga-pet
You niggas can't see me unless you watchin' the TV or ultra huggin' my silhouette
My flow got the ceiling wet, I spit 'til I feel my breath
Who sinkin' my fuckin' chest? She fuckin' the fuckin' best
Mean my dick is the dick of death, mean I'm killin that pussy
Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept
Yeah, Dre
Me and Andre the Giant, 6'7 and climbin'
Whether you storm to your climate
Whether your beat makin' or rhyming
Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman
Hand full of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island with Ray Bans
Glasses palmin' asses that probably came wit a great tan (laughs)
I be the motherfuckin' mecca of these hub city spectrum
Where they at I will dissect them like a fucking frog rectum
Why you wreckin' with irreputable my worst flow incredible
They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera etcetera Bentley passin up Celicas
They tellin' us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch
And Top Dawg can vouch bitch
Nigga what you 'bout, about face with army outfits
The generals here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin' pinnacles of life and despair and me I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never askin' Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzin' and still a proud poet
Put me in a category
I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory
Your pain bore me you ain't really lived it
I take you to a block where they Crippin
Or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen
Bitch I been doin' before you niggas ruined it
Show me somethin' different
You either kissin' dick or givin' me distance
You live in a district of dimebags and dummies I know your statistics
Who your boss, he more like my assistant
Get lost have a egg and a biscuit
Break fast when we aimin' them biscuits
Pay cash when your chain come up missin'
Q...Q
If you want to be from HiiiPoWeR
Please come to friend zone
But don't wowwy
You will not suck on my dick tonight
Okay, I'm riding through Leimert, my tires in reverse
I'm lost but I know this foreign navigation works
I made a right on King, I seen a couple skirts
I said "bitch get in but dust them sandals off first"
Okay, I'm doing 105 on 105
Witnesses had said they seen a ball of fire
Bitch I'm tryna president at Jive while you talking jive
All these presidents, won't be surprised if one came alive
I only fuck with playas and pimps nigga
You a created player like Sims nigga
My cup be filled up to the brim nigga
Yo bitch fixing her make-up in my rims nigga
You just target practice
Everybody say they seen it but nobody know what happened
What happened yesterday baby girl fix your mood
Cause I don't like my head with some attitude
And I don't like your legs 'less they at the roof
Pedicure toward the ceiling, mollys in the cabinet too
Pop, pop, pop, popping pussy rather casual
Section 80 paid me ho so this is what I had to do
Ball, I ball, iPhone, million dollar missed calls
I hit the bank, withdrawals
I make her plank, with no drawers
Mothafucka, I ball
I’m talking right now, and let me tell ya something
If you like talking to me on this show
You’ll let me talk when I'm out here
The bottom line for these people right here is
If you’re a man, you don’t cry about it
Ya take life, the ups and downs
If you’re a real man, ya never go down, ya just stay up
That’s why I’m the World Champion
That’s why this sport coat cost Eight hundred dollars
And that cost two hundred
And I dunno what that cost, I’d be ashamed to wear it
That’s why I wear Lizard shoes, and a Rolex watch
And I’ve got a limousine sitting out there, a mile long
With twenty-five women, just dying for me to go
Woo!
Because I'm the World Champion, sucker
No man's gonna take this from me unless it's done in the ring
And next time you have the opportunity, talk to your accountant
And look who built the building your officed in
What's up love? (What's up love?)
It's been a while (Been a while)
You been good? (Been good?)
I've been around (Uh-huh)
Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chows (Uh-huh)
Truant like a student, you the principal (Alright)
Schooled me on timing, we was both shining (Alright, alright)
Like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond (True)
I was Your Highness, you was my queen (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
You got over him when I got in between
Watching Martin on TBS as it was tedious
For us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
And come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir
Wake it back up, Folger's holsters
By my waistline, shot for your heart and
You called it a hate crime, say you want me back
And your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit
4-0-1 K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?
One time
Reporting live
Compton, California
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
And life's a bitch, don't hit women, so I bit her
I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playing
I was so sincere like Nas first name, in Belly
They tell me, it's very difficult to see 25
And if I survive it's probably with a celly
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
In the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
Fulfilling voids of broke D-Boys selling weed
Fucking up my prestige, 'til I live with the blues
BB King or the neighbors of Snoop, that's why I'm
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are (fine)
We are, we are (true)
Through the, through barbed (wires)
We will, will break (through)
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Tryna get away from the world's stereotype
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny, she desperately
In need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
She gon have a baby then flee from her education
At the age of 16, credit card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
She'll never get by, no how, no way
Welfare recipient, property of the state
Housing, Section 8, corner store prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute
Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
And this baby daddy is new to the family
Chilling in pajamis, waiting on the first
Fast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say she can't live comfortable
She gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are (fine)
We are, we are (true)
Through the, through barbed (wires)
We will, will break (through)
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire
Have you ever felt like, you finally got life
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
Living off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian
In the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
It's like we just hit the lottery, my God
There must be a God, cause golly
You done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali
Now ya lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs
And you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
Making good decisions, got a independent business-mind
And both of y’all are steady grindin', doing it the legal way
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say they can't live comfortable
They gone tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So even if you overcame doubt and ya living ain't bad
Know it's a barbed wire that's always in your path
Through the barbed wire (just laugh)
Then everybody say...
'Cause I won't get caught again
And I'm here to stop the trends
You can catch me if you try
Disappear into the night
And I'm gone
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga
I rap with a Pyrex in the projects
I'm crack in a pot, I'm a prospect
I'm a pirate on a dock full of dope, uh
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You can not test no King in a Tesla
Bitch, I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras, uh
It's Alive (Uh, uh, shit, shit, uh, uh, shit, shit)...
*Lyrics from Snippet 2*
...I'm not a newcomer, I'm a new wonder elite
Break the handcuffs, choke slam the officer...
Pushing a hoopty, bumping the Fugees
My life is a scary movie, your life is a male groupie
Kendrick Lamar broke the handle with 22 Uzis
Stuffed it in my mouth and cack-cack-cack!
Killed the rappers that knew me
Compton’s most wanted, I live my life in a dungeon
Came out a dragon I can probably touch the sun with...
My bare hands, what are your plans? To win a Grammy?
Sweet taste of victory, like Oprah’s punany?
Don’t judge me that’s just some irony, trust me
I like to laugh and get lucky
My sense of humor is rumored to be a Gemini’s company
Come with me, in the planet rock
And I plan to rock in a plantation
Chasing many legends that made it
Face it you will never be Pac-10 even when the planet stop
I’m 2012 on a 12-inch, aiming straight at your pelvis
Elvis would come back as a Black if he was hot
You’re just a mascot on a Kim Kardashian ass-shot
Life at the bottom is devastating
You’re hardly ever debated, the party is obligated
By suckers that wanna be you and never live with the Matrix
And never ever related to struggle and dedication
Your hustle is nominated, anonymous and you faded
The promises that a victory lap is surely awaited
They vomitted everytime that a rapper’s annihilated
Just wish them happy belated, fuck you I made it, I’m on
Babies from 80's don't know—know no better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance
But the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine, some of them feminine
'member the universe used to be innocent
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Everyday that I wake up, I'mma sin again
I'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section.80
Show of hands, how many been taking notes? Good. Leave everything on the table now. Vulnerability, this is your generation. Show, show your pain
One time, I took a swim in the Nile
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear
It made me relax when I came down
I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now
Plunging away 'less my body's on top
All of these currents might cost me my life right now
When danger finds me, it follows with tides
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride
She said
Told myself if I dive in it without precaution of a lifejacket
Then I'll dive in it 'til I am exhausted and I'm type lacking
Waistline on four deep, senses on four deep
Feel like there's four me
One time, I took a swim in the Nile (One time, I took in a swim in the Nile; one time)
I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around
Man, I swear (I swear, I swear)
It made me relax when I came down (When I came down)
I felt liberated like free birds, I'm stimulated now (Stimulated)
Plunging away 'less my body's on top (Stimulated, stimulated now; On top)
All of these currents might cost me my life right now (Right now, right now)
Where danger finds me, it follows with tides (Follows with tides; stimulated right now)
Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride
That's some good
I'm in the Nile, deep in denial
I'm in the Nile, deep in denial
That's some good
Like kindergarteners
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in–
–to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
I’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
I'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing but my luck has been
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga
I'm focused
Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated...
What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway
When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him
Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale
Cus' we ain't gonna win
Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen
(shit)
Don't mind me I'm just thinking again
Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
Cus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimes
Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
Hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
It's not a game, it's nothing to play with
Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay
Struggle that is
I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life
That means what I'm thinking is right
Punch, loop the beat for a minute
Moment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way home
Know he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soon
Wait a minute K. Dot! you said turn it back on, bring it back
If dreams was reality
If it was cool for you to be a casualty
The only way that you can escape poverty
Say that I'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when I said it the first time
You're listening too far if you hear this part
I suggest you go back and press rewind
I fast forward to common thoughts of a human
Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paint
Look what I brought to my state that they can't bring - the industry need a fix
Stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music
O-pi-um, inside the veins of them, I don't abuse it
Capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving
Direct them to a casket
Give it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want...
I'm losing you again ain't I?
Ain't I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states?
Black President, they don't wanna see that
It's evident...pain is pain
We only love to hate each other that's striving for great-ness
I swear to God that we live in a Matrix
Take that blue pill then we start seeing spaceships
Kanye, west-coast niggas do it the best
Bring each other down, crab in a bucket effect
We learn to live with it I guess
I mean die with it, since we're already dead
Trying to cross over to heaven, that's what I said the first time
Get it? Now little boy I gotta sit you down
Teach you about the things that we live around
Materialistic things that we buyin' now means nothing later when the dream kick in
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...
What happened in Manhattan happens all the time
In the hood, conspiracy to cover up crime
No nickel and dime, one shot pettiness
I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the president
World trade happened on the world stage
Same stage look at us as some educated apes
On video stations women gyrating
Parading around, mind-raping the youth
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...
What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to, die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway
God, let me right my wrongs, God, let me write this song
God in the middle with a month
Let me hit the pawn shop, momma said we need a loan
God, let me dedicate this to the 80% that ain't never coming home
God, let me know you exist
In a city where a hundred hollow-tips get thrown
I'm off that Centennial
Fuckin' at the party, nigga, at the party, we fade ten or more
My hood came thinkin' we yellin', "We in this bitch"
Then we yellin', "We in your bitch"
Or you tellin' all of us our dwellin' inside of 2Pacalypse, thug life
And we off that whoopty-whoopty-whoop
And we in that hoopty with the two choppers
So we're guaranteed to shoot
Lock us in the L.A. County zoo
Watch us eat a bear alive and ooh
This feels so good to keep it true
This feels so good, I'm keepin' you
Hope I'm teachin' you all the lessons I learned
When I made that turn off the 110
Watch that marijuana just burn
This shit just make you wanna just sin
See that Staples Center high earnin' if the Lakers get me a win
I'm gon' liquor shot in memory of Pac, Makaveli live again
Bitch, I'm in L.A. yeah, yeah, motherfucker
Blessed are the arrogant
For there is the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away
Like your pain
Into my world
There's this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
There's this power that pulls us like magnets
Into my world
There's this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
There's this power that pulls us like magnets
Let’s talk about power
Let's talk about yours and ours that paid the allowance
Let's talk about hundred-thousand kids ravin’ and bouncin
Cravin' and drownin in words the day I pronounce it
Let's talk about power
Let's talk about do'ers and dont'ers
The house I built when I was homeless and sleepin' in corners
Sharin’ Coronas and Black & Milds
Donuts in El Caminos
Talkin’ loud, scrapin' and combin'
Residue every mornin'
Talk about legacy
Let's talk about the life of celebrity
Verses integrity
Curse the first one that thirst for necessity
Searching for equity
Verses the earth that birthed us indefinitely
Verse the verse I wrote in jeopardy
Surfin' the laws of the universe and destiny
Church and a God is all that’s ever been ‘head of me, aw
Let's talk about my power, the golden child was
Granted to be on your cameras and store counters
He’s bananas, competitive, we can dance
See the damage, no more fo’ he peed his pants
My second LP had real niggas on POTUS lawn
My seven trophies is at my Granny's and Heaven arms
I'm in Jamaica like “wah gwaan,” my feet is out
My hair is long and patois comin' from my mouth
Me, I go outdoors it's time to bless up erryuhn'
Rude boy, me, I ain't worry 'bout it, fearless
I shot niggas, then shot movies ten years later
Dear God, why you show me so much favor?
Amongst the haters and wickedness (wickedness)
Deliver this child from evil convictions and frivolous (frivolous)
Debates about who's the preeminent emcee of the millennium
And it's all for the Benjamins
And I'm all of y'all nemesis
And I'm all in all happy none of y'all can fathom who Kendrick is
The only One that ever did wrote the Book of Genesis
Motherfucker, that's power
Into my world
There's this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
There's this power that pulls us like magnets
And may the force that be with us forever
Be right here to guide us
Your sensitivity is very sensitive to mine
Hey, what up, cuz? Man
It's ya boy Crunch, man, checkin' in, man
Heard you playin' in a couple weeks, man
Holla at me when you get this message, though
Holla at me, it's important, holla at me
Oh yeah, I forget to tell you, I got a new toy
Got a brand new toy
So you know what I'm gettin' ready to do to it, baby
Turnt out that chrome on that paint, baby
That chrome comin' in June, baby
I been chicken chasin' all summer, ya dig me?
I been chasin' chicken all summer, pocket muscle
That's the new thing now, pocket muscle, a.k.a. chicken
I was down, bad, then my life switched (Then my life switched)
What a crisis, my Black Seville with no license (No license)
I was lifeless, I was deadweight, I was triflin' (I was triflin')
Then my eye twitched, then my hand shook, and my fist balled
Then my right wrist took a risk for us
Saw lightning that made titans (I was triflin')
With a pitchfork, we ate yo' food then got bent more
With excitement, big wars on my neck piece
VVS be fightin', move fast like loose jazz
I gotta race the world and be vibrant
No plates on my scrape, yeah, that's mando
Massaging the handle left hand on the candle (Huh)
I'm too high profile to drive Lambo, that there is a scandal
That man grab a handful (Huh)
Never been loved (Easy), bet I pull up (Beep beep)
I got a thing for her, I wanna fuck (Freaky)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (Easy)
I got a thing for her
I mean I get you niggas out the way right now today, you say so
Take the safe and doctor pay 'em aimin' 'fore the case closed
Operate, then meet the player move on then for escrow
Hol' up wait, since Section 8 that's on my day to day though
Man-Man don't shake hand, he pop shit (Out the way)
She stargaze out through the cosmic (Out the way)
Amped up, we blew out the metropolis (Out the way)
And I've been too involved, huh (Out the way)
And I got tens on call, huh (Out the way)
And you pretend you ball, huh
I'ma do this for my dawg, you need a life jacket
Throw you in the deep end, that's now my target practice
Never been love (Easy), bet I pull up (Beep beep)
I got a thing for her
Everybody, just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
But I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror then realize, that real lies within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather 2-step, like my first steps
Jill Scott on my iPod, as my head rests
Yes
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha ha ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Still face, play me short like an oompa loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killas man, people who killed men
But my character never could be like them, man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man
Live my life through some film, man
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
Cause they know that they don't know Kendrick fo' sho
And oh
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photobook to remember me
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killas, chasing hits
Lying to yourself, all over an image
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My Mama said, "Boy, that don't sound like you."
I said, "This is the sound, though."
My only excuse
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
And kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
Watch the Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life, to mix it up in a blender
To make sure that you feel me
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
Of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of Rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
That I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
That means I'll be frontin'
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
That the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dave said he proud of my newfound honesty
And all I could say is, "Will the radio care?"
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my hip-hop when I was 16 years old
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
22, like the smallest of guns that you know
Most determined, but with the smallest of funds to show
But I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn as soon as my records spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focused, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar, and soon ya'll know Cloud 9, ya'll
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word, righteous
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word
Weezy wassup with it bruddah?
Tell Maestro I need to fuck over his beat real quick
Hear me?
I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9
That's no lie, ho
Rappers out they mothafucking minds so I gotta go
Psycho on these niggas, call me Norman Bates with a poker face
Got the banger in my hand and I'm out to poke your face
.38 Special, grab it, let him have it, where the safe, we hungry
Housing authority saved my Section 8
My section be on the west side of Compton Cali, champ
Where the killers posted on the corner like a letter stamp
Let a rapper tell me I ain't better than whoever's out
I'ma knock 'em out his Force 1's once I air 'em out
Air jets flying 'cross the atlas, I made it momma, made a promise
Married to hip hop, and the maid of honor gonna be R&B
I'm fucking her too, so please hand me my condoms
Where the honeymoon in the mother fucking booth
You're fucking right, I'm the fucking truth
I put my hand on the bible
Swear to god if I lie, then I'll probably die tomorrow
Tell my momma don't feel sorrow cause her son was a gunner
They found my corpse with a rapper's head in my stomach
I'm right here, I ain't running even if the Iraqis w-was in back of me
Back against the wall I'm clapping them rapidly y'all
Would never stop what you can't see
It's like a red light when driving with Stevie
Wonder if you can understand or withstand the blast of my wrath
I steer the game with both hands while you crash
Like Earnhardt my heart to the fallen soldiers
You can either ride, or get rolled over
Sleeping on me, I put you in a coma
So please chill out before you meet the coldest
Starving every day, see my face where the bowl is
Bowl on my face, I walk while my mouth hold it
Hold it
I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9
21 gun salute
And my soldiers killed 20 of your troops at a time
And I got about nine teens on the corner fucking with marijuana
Jive and heard about 18 rappers say that a bird can go for 17.5
Motherfuck that my sweet 16's be equivalent to about 15 pie
I was 14 when I wrote a rhyme
All I seen was 13 ghosts every time I wrote a crazy line
All these 12 bars in my verses, that's what Notorious and Pac arrived
God dammit I spit just like a Mac 11 every time
I drop jewels, you drop dimes, you pretending to be like mine
I intend to put about 10 of you rappers on channel 9
Straight up, fuck around and get ate up
Cut 'em up in 7 ways, funeral carried by 6 in 5 days you'll know I go for
Money when I sink my teeth in Carter III beats
To you from me, my son the victory is mine, I won
I'm the one
The beat was the pussy
And I cum, hard
All day hoe, my neck look sweeter than parfait hoe
Rap Derek Jeter in a red two-seater
I can throw this dick from far away hoe (swish it, swish it)
Ask me how long do it take to be the greatest
I'm a bar away hoe (swish it, swish it)
Damn Kanye never will it be safe
Bitch I already know (swish it, swish it)
24/7 365 days everybody gettin' paid
Nigga lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJ's
Chitown, PJ all of BJ
Chitown, we play for the freebase
These days, don't believe what police say
DJ's and the B-boys run shit
Only way I can sum it up, sumbitch
I used to write rhymes, all day and all night
While you were playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
My conscious only knew whats half tight
At 3:14, it's time to give me a slice, my nigga
This is a dog's fight, my nigga
The soundtrack to life, my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party, and ate Apple Jacks
Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Pump, fake, jumpshot, ball hit the back
Board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack
That's because that's these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Pardon me though, I'm searching for answers
The good kid from the ugly city, that's mad that he's handsome
Where is the love?
Give me rings, give me chains, mane
Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range
Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Then give me some land, or maybe I'll land a, G5
Clearport, say hello to the man
Give me awards, grammies, and let the crowd applaud
My name 'til they strain the veins in they vocal cords
Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said, give me Tiger sports endorsements
Give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for
Manahattan and 40/40, no 40's but rose poured
Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters cameras be
Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts
And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar, this is me
And that's love
Now everybody smoke to it, for this is, the celebration
(1) Transitional Slide - 'U'
Scene 1: Screams
(00:00 - 00:30)
With the opening screams the audience can also sense that something is eerie; these sounds are in the original track combined creating a dangerous visual. Then beginning to see Kendrick pouring his heart out in to his liquor in a schizophrenic manner.
Scene 2: The Hotel Room
(00:30 - 01:26)
Hearing the chorus "Loving you is complicated" - the image starts to depict that there is an internal struggle going on with him loving himself. The scene is immensely minimalistic and filled with dark lighting, this accompanied by his throne like chair creates for a deep setting for imagery to take a place in the film.
Scene 3: Mirror
(01:27 - 01:57)
The mirror representative of an internal reflection; as the struggle of how he views himself as the words utter "I ****** tell you, you ****** failure—you ain't no leader!", the negatively intrinsic views we beginnings to see why he hates himself for the mistakes he has made.
Scene 4: Tipsy
(01:57 - 02:10)
Stumbling all over the place into his throne - blurred visions of the camera shaking around giving us P.O.V. (Point of Vision) of what it is like to be overly intoxicated.

Scene 6 Part 1: Spinning Bottle
(02:37 - 03:42)

Notice this high angle shot focusing down on Lamar with a demonic reflection in the background of the mirror choosing to do it's own thing every now and then.
Scene 6 Part 2: Smashed Mirror
(03:30 - 03:42)
An easily missed technique of a reflection of himself breaking the mirror of reality down, smashing into pieces before the screen goes black into the next slide.
(3) Transitional Slide - 'Clearance sale: 100% off'
*** PART 2: For Sale ***
Scene 1: The Dunk
(03:43 - 07:11)

(8) Transitional Slide - 'Always trust a n**** with cornrows'
Scene 3: Lost/Distractions

(10) Transitional Slide - 'Never trust a n**** with too many haircuts'
(11) Transitional Slide - 'Tracee Ellis Ross is vibrant'

How the industry strips you down for what you have got like strippers and take your money and keep you trapped in their vicious cycle.

CONCLUSION
I can tell you what it is, I can tell you what it isn't
No more K. Dot, my mother had named me Kendrick
Fuck a stage name, that's the name that I was given
The only thing that I can identify within this business
I'm just a good kid from Compton that want to rap
Weighing my options, pick up a Bible or a strap?
I never killed a man, never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
But this monkey on my back, y'all don't want me to win
I'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends
So just to get a dollar, will I sell my soul?
I look the Devil in the eye and tell him, "Hell no"
They say anything worth having is worth the wait
Well, I want the world, tell me how long that takes
There's no time like now, I can cut my patience short
Or give 'em some more gowns, I don't even want the crown
I just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when I get it
You won't get a piece of mine, won't you mind your own business?
A rich nigga buy anything you sell him
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell him
Well I'm a broke nigga, but still I wouldn't listen to you
Even if your hand was on a Bible quote, nigga, pfttuh
See I was brought up different
Whatever that my pops said, for sure I'd listen
You said you did dirt, but I can't dig it
It don't concern you if you wasn't born in it
Oh-no-oh-oh
I swear we got to fast-forward, before time flies by
My new saying for '0-10 is, why lie?
And if you ain't trying to win, then why try?
Now you can low-ball or give me high five
This is I nigga, look into my eye
Nigga, I am Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, pfttuh
And that used to be a hell of a task
Now I'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass
My character like it don't carry a confidence
That can marry a Halle Berry or Angelina with no cash
I'm bout to cash in my thoughts
Give you a compass, then tell you get lost
What I'm bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom
Once the Eves come, they quick to stare at him
Hoping I don't take their bitch, but I'm on some other shit
When I'm done, I'm tryna run the government
These are big dreams, transition from a rapper to a human being
You can't 'school' a dean
I be tutoring artist-es, leave 'em with no audience
All cause they all a facade, my God
Y'all be out partying, I be stealing your audience
All because who I are, Lamar
But my first name, it gotta be Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, now let's go
But we can't go... backwards
This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6th
Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
Like should I start trapping?
If what I write down don't collect this very moment
Then I'm on it, no question
In the streets, my niggas is well connected, let's see
Do I cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots, chopping the rocks like Flintstone feet
This is me, frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
And hope one day it flourish to a kilo
Track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners whipping?
"I thought you had a show?" Well, my nigga, I guess I didn't
I'm tryna get this dough, and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
Curb-serving, or I might be in your store boosting
Two-elevens with Mac-11s like fuck Hip Hop
Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be Pac
Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got
Or everything getting shot, for nothing
Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
Then expand to the Hoover dam, water, sherm
Contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
You'll know I always had a passion for riddling, writing
But lately, I've been thinking 'bout taking chances to brighten
My future financially, so please don't be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
So I tell my nigga, "Front me, let me put it on the strip"
Then give it back when I think about the consequence
Shit...
R.O.T.C—Right On Time Conscience
You was a college student abusing the credit union
The music was way too loud, the tuition was fuckin stupid
And me I was runnin' wild hittin' licks in my mothers' Buick
Confusing, you like my style even though I was broke and doing
Stick em ups, you wanna pick em up
Inside your Civic Plus the difference was
I wasn't rich as fuck you still would depend on us
And I missed the crush that we had every time winter December come
And we had tempers and arguments, disagreements and senses from
Cupid himself, and I'm shootin' himself
And the paramedics won't come even if you scream for help
Don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself
And I'm losing now too looking at you boo hoo from what's dealt
So as I reminisce the coupon that we used to split at Rally's
On your mothers couch your little brother in the alley
You say K. Dot your page got that pay that Birdman and Jay got
One day you'll reap what you sow, now I reap for us both
That's one hunnid
Sometimes I want to leave, sometimes I want to cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I want to lie
Sometimes I want to school the youth, sometimes I want to ride
Sometimes I want to not think, sometimes I want to vibe
Sometimes I want to bump Tribe and zone out
This song's 'bout a young boy that's gone wild inside
When my world collide
With your world where your girl and your kids reside
We killed the facades, we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much
If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush
If my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
So she can be cool to be, amongst popularity
The various name brands that reached the price scan
It's not about the right price but more like the right scam
To rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw
The picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
That lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? then I'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are, farther you're from the white man's home
Negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity, they parted our families
They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague
Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross (uh)
And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar
400 years of nothing, 400 years of suffering
400 years of tears, and tribulations, miseducation
See what we facing is now coming back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot
Called us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuit
Of happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do
Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to
About a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her hand bag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me
She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to 26's after riding Kobes
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the 400 years we never saw
The reason why the next 400 we gotta floss
Slaves
I said the 400 years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
Is the reason why when we get a little bit of change
We over exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
You're a vanity slave
If you're a female and you got 4,5,6 rings on your finger
Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
You're a vanity slave
If you got an 02' Monte Carlo with 24's on it
And on the back of the window it says, "Get on my level ho"
You're a vanity slave
We're all vanity slaves, and with that being said
Can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
I'm not from around here, hey Ali, where we at? Idaho?
Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month, checks coming in
I'm tryna get some
What up?
Niggas hatin', bitches hatin', babies dyin'
Bullets flyin', helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killin' no cure
Oil spillin', turmoil, poverty-stricken, police brutality
Kickin' ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, Botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message
To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map
Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
The governor keeps us starvin', these commercials keep us buyin'
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion
See that's forbidden, we fryin'
My nigga, what it look like?
That's exactly what Hell look like
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spittin'
Pac is rapping, Gregory tappin', people singing, bells is ringing
Children playing, angels praying, 14 karat golden streets, collard greens
Red wine, potato yams, turkey legs, calling every human being...
You got—you got some more moscato?
When things get hard to swallow, we need a bottle of Moscato
Puts me in the mood for your loving, you love it
We can even do it tomorrow, just bring a bottle of Moscato
(Haha, I know we said P&P Baby)
Puts me in the mood for your loving
(But now we on something new)
You love it
Guess whose back in this motherfucka
Looking like a motherfuckin' Chi-town pimp, alright
Make my money flip, make my money flip
Make my money flip, I been in the gym all night
Came in the game with a dollar and a dream
And a AK clip with an infrared beam
I pop that trunk, make everybody scream
Put a missing punk on everybody's screen
Ain't nothing changed but the ends I'm holding
My dick is big and my nuts is swollen
I don't know if you've noticed but a nigga be rolling
With a bad bitch and the bitch be rolling
Dolphin pills and Moscato spills
Everything she need to get her thrill
No Hennessy on the bartender bill
Just good wine and a good place to chill
I feel I might get loose tonight and fuck your girlfriend
I mean I feel she might come through tonight, plus her girlfriend
In a 5-Star suite with a 5-Star freak
Slinging that dick while baby eat
On her punani, ooh mommys, look at yours bodies, I'm geeked
Having a good time
Put my pain in a mothafuckin' bottle
A chain and a diamond ring don't feel the same
If a nigga ain't got his eyes closed (eyes closed)
I know you had a hard day baby, relax your mind
Shit, soon as Christ turned water into wine everything was fine
When things get hard to swallow, we need a bottle of Moscato
Puts me in the mood for your loving, you love it
We can even do it tomorrow, just bring a bottle of Moscato
(Haha, I know we said P&P Baby)
Puts me in the mood for your loving
(But now we on something new)
You love it

Ahhh! Ahhh!
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
Lucifer was all around
So I kept running
Until I found my safe haven
I was trying to convince myself the stripes I got
Making myself realize what my foundation was
(In the room, and I run it)
(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)
But while my loved ones were fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Ay on my momma, nigga (R.I.P. Pat Dawg)
I'mma be the greatest to ever do this shit
On my momma, doe like...
On the dead homies
Aye Sounwave turn this shit up nigga
Turn this shit up! Sounwave, turn this shit up nigga
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?
Jumping on my dick, but this dick ain't free
To Pimp a Butterfly, another classic CD
Ghetto lullaby for every one-day MC
(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)
Nigga, now R.I.P
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, "God!"
Bad trips like, "Yea!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us
Then we gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reapin' everything I sow, so my karma come
And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record
I'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want, you a house, you a car?
40 acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every little zero
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
I never felt the feeling of euphoria
Pain forever or prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
Wake up in the morning and I gotta win
Not taking the victory, that's my only sin
And so I send a message to your messenger
A warning shot to let em know I'm serious
I'm ready for a war, when I roar it can break a glass window
The only thing for sure: the perfect way to bend you
On your back even if I gotta slither through the cracks
I can crack every code you deliver, I attack
Every hole where the bomb squad sit it on the tripod
Even if you try hard, he can still die hard
Run but you can't hide: white flags
You can pull em out fast and tell me your last goodbye
I will, I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I got to lose? What I got to prove?
I guess war is my love
Make sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing
You know I take risk: dark clouds, I love it
Cause I can hide in the mist, hop out
And crush every soldier you're with, so I'm 6 for 6
I'm sick with determination: I'll terminate ya quick
I lead the pack, I follow no rules
I see the traps, I know you're close to
Falling on your face, unload, reload
Hand me another case, explode, explode
The fire of my eyes is waiting on your demise
I know you hope your help is close by
I will, I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I got to lose? What I got to prove?
I guess war is my love
And we'll be screamin' out no rules, no rules
Feel the energy we go through, I told you
Pump my fist like I'm supposed to, I showed you
My vision of the unsocial, it's so cool
Look around me and you'll see the scene, who to blame?
See my generation has no shame, I play the game
How I see it this is inside the future, this is nothin' that you're used to
I refuse to play the victim, my religion is to move ya
Out your power position, my army head-on collision
Can't harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance
Every time that I zone in, nothing is more convincin'
Than tellin' you that I won't bend, break or fake partition
I can't, this is my life design, this is me taking mine's
This is what I live for, this is me takin' yours
This is more than C4, this is what happens when
We ready to build and destroy, I hope that you enjoy
I live my life a rebel, a vigilante, devils try to get at me
Pedal through this underworld, undertakers won't catch me
System ain't no system for justice if you would ask me
I'll tell you everything is corrupted, don't you walk past me
With the condescended look I can tell you're pretendin'
Like you my friends and you just a henchman, I feel relentless
I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
Or cut you with it, I'm cut from a cloth that bred a nuisance
Trespass on your property I am properly aimin' to go against ya democracy
This is me changing faces cause I can stand alone and die alone as long as I got pride
The victory of fight is all in my eyes
The night is young and I can see your demise, I'm waitin' for it
You can’t ignore it, you live dormant, I die enormous
Big as the lies you tell I can tell you feel defeated
The truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason, capisce?
24/7, 365, motherfucker I'm still right on time
Oh you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horses mouth, you'll never understand me
I told you my Plan B is to win your hearts before we win a Grammy
These Days ain't shit changed, different toilet, same shit
And I drank a whole gallon of laxatives by accident
Just to shit on you has-beens
Had it been for my past tense, I wouldn't be rapping
See these streets made me, broke me down
Built me up, drove me crazy
Made me hungry, made you hate me, but fuck love
It don't make dollars, it don't make sense nigga
By the way, that's DJ Quik nigga, respect or check it
These days, I'm a little more focused
Cause y'all cracked the door and I kicked it open
Yellin' get the fuck down or I will shoot
I told you not to motherfuckin' move!
Be another example
I'll take the whole industry hostage if I have to
I'll sabotage this game, a good kid?
Yeah that's only in my mama's eyes
I seen a dead body at five and that shit made me traumatized
So These Days, a little blood on my hands ain't nothing compared
To hopping out a minivan, with a mini 22 3's and the homie TuTu
And two more YGs, oh nobody got time for that!
These Days it's only time for rap!
So Herbert Anthony Stevens
You make or break bread before we break even
Before they broke our records we broke records
And wrote pieces, of history
So These Days? These accolades that's meant for we?
It's only truth that this shit was meant to be, T.D.E
I watch that fire that we're gathered around and see that it burns similar to the fire that is inside you...
I remember, uhh
When my uncles
Served smokers
On Alondra
In front of our building, they was my heroes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Uhh, and that's scary to me
Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
Especially when Sounwave is on his P's
Nigga cue me in I'm a Peruvian drug lord
Don't fast forward, I'ma serve you some keys
This is crack co-caine, I'm Kurt Co-bain
And I bang like a C-R-I-P
P-I-R-U, high you I'm a I-V
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack— STOP
I said a I-V cuz when I be in the studio, I shot
A needle in your veins, take it in vein
Or itch till your eyeballs pop
I'm cold on the cold turkey
I hate chickens but I do fuck pretty birdies
Where your girl at? Over the Pyrex, where my world at
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Uhh, and it's scary to me
Every listener is a strawberry to me
You pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
Z's on K.Dot? Uh-uh better wake up
A nightmare, I'm right there like a Siamese
-Twin, when, you mothafuckas gon' learn?
Curl up like Big Worm when I drop
Who fly? I'm a red eye with eye drops
I Big, I Pac, you Chris, I Rock
That's Pookie on New Jack head first with a cyclops
I'm the first one to do that I bet you never knew that
Back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
If ain’t about me about ho it be about face
If you ain’t on higher—learning
There's soda in the pot and the fire—burning
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Uhh, and it's scary to carry
A smooth type flow like a drink of Merlot
That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo
When I turbo on any track, it's a Reynold's wrap
And I rap like a nigga who invented rap
Rapping heat, you can fall to defeat
If you don't pay ya tolls like the limbs on ya feet
I suppose this is bigger than life
This is probably everybody, Illuminati
Guess I'm the blood sacrifice of the party
I undress her like a Harley
Lights will flash, cars will crash
Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
So my bad if I put you in rehab
You are reimbursed, put it on my tab
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Aw dude, you're about to fuckin' OD bro
Tell to myself, still on fire
I'm under attack, but I'm still on fire
I got some chatter, but I'm still on fire
I got some threat, but I'm still on fire
I got some liabilities, but I'm still on fire
If it's not amazing that I'm on fire
I've been to hell and back, but I'm still on fire
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I swear the Lord is my shepherd, I'm 'bout to go cop a Lexus
I'm 'bout to go fuck Alexis, take this and flood my Rolexes
This black on black is a blessin'
Black on black crime on my weapon
I protect mine on my mama and 'em, these my Usher confessions
Let it burn - Tee-Tee and Tiana sexting
Teepees and mansions I rest in
Two T's and Top Dawg impress with
TV's that play their investment
K-D-O-T go tee off and TG's and YG's gon' press it
It's our turn - I pray that I never lose you
Cause I like Benji and beaucoup bucks at my wrists
They do voodoo, curse you forever, you better not touch it
The clutching I'm used to, 250 speed racing crucial
Nigga, Vrrrrm
(Check that homie out, homie, that's K.Dot)
My youngins asking me do you consider role models useful
It's hard to say when I'm neutral, I'm tryna find out myself
Find inner peace inside heaven, find diamond piece inside hell
Will I learn
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official
Let me tell you when it all started
Game dropped Documentary and made plenty enemies
It was a classic album, but prior to that
Guerilla Black debuted and put the city on wax
A lot of Biggie comparisons, we all was aware of them
But that wasn't my M.O., I just thought he was dope
Can't understand why Game would say his name in that manner
Many years went by, still no legitimate answer
Anyway, I put out a mixtape in 12th grade
Hub City threat, minor of the year, DJ Dave
And his brother designed, put together the music
Put it out to the people, the people said I was stupid
With the flow, went to the barbershop to show off my skills
Mike and Himey and some other cat said I was real
Himey was Games barber, the other cat made a statement
Saying that Game was his partner, so I gave him my tape
Said he'd play it for him, hoping that I'd get my big break
But never got a response.. anyway
This nigga named Pop Gates came to my school with a camera
I freestyled on his DVD for a minute then after
It hit the streets, I was known as K. Dot from Compton
Man Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin'
But I didn't have a home yet, Hootie had ? in me
Until I met Top Dawg, told Dave that he'd like to meet
Me at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour
Told me come back tomorrow, but I came back in a hour
Jay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape
Was skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed
But we got over that, heard the beat, wrote a rap
Did our first collaboration on the Nephew track
He got signed months later, Warner Brothers
We started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper
Before Sidekicks became a modern day phone
Same time our buzz was generated from G Malone
He had a song called 200, White Lightnin, the streets loved it
Said that Sony had gave him an unbelievable budget
Now that's a smart nigga, I'm tryna make my raps bigger than life
But not knowing how to market it right
Turned on the radio
Only cat new from the West Coast was playin' was Bishop
And by then this nigga' buzz was tremendous
In the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft
What the fuck? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up
It was a hit
When I heard it
But all we had was the instrumental and the hook
But when
Rock jump on it for certain, it was to smash
Gave it to Julio, just to get his opinion
Next thing you know, the record was
Spinning
That was a good look, it set the coast on fire
Niggas in Garden projects presents Watts Riot
Then these rappers start hating, callin' up to the station
Ask why they record ain't playin', what you niggas complaining, about?
Shit was funny to us tho
Niggas hate to see a nigga from the bottom come up, yo
In the midst of the single poppin' and niggas tryna seek and destroy
I had a situation with Def Jam, premature
Shit went sour after Jay-Z left but they didn't care
I was glad Jay-Z gave me respect
See I was young, fast forward, hot dollah had the streets on lock
Far as radio play, obvious, he got a lot
Beefing’ with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it
Which in my opinion, I didn’t think the shit was impo’tant
But that’s a whole ‘nother story, we hit the lab with Game
And a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy
Did the cypher freestyle and everybody’s like, "Wow"
These Top Dawg niggas ‘bout to make noise"
Surely after Game took us on tour, I love you for that
But right after that, we didn’t see him no more
G Malone came with a smash hit with Akon
Mistah FAB battled Royce Nickel with napalm
Then everybody start to scream out the new West
And claim that West Coast legends don’t want to see him at best
I think that’s just an excuse, because their music ain't tight
Tell ‘em that Ab-soul said it, they can quote him twice
Then Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killin’ the internet
But he been a threat since Deathrow, then Roccett came about
And all I thought about was Ab-Soul 2Eleven too
It finally started to look like the West was makin’ moves
Western Union had the whole block boomin’ because of Snoop
Matter fact, Bad Lucc was my favorite about the group
Then ?Problem? took off, another Compton native
We both Compton niggas, but Compton still ain't made it
By this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves
We almost got into some major beef over Lil’ Wayne
That part I'mma leave out
Theres certain things that the streets only should know about
Shout out to Nipsey
Bishop win that game, then had a fight with X.O
That’s when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me
Because they didn’t see my views, grab the hottest album out and re-do it
That’s a goddamn power move stupid
You foolish, don’t know shit about this war shit
Theres mo’ shit to wanting to be the king of the coast shit
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official
So two weeks ago I finally run into the nigga I gave my mixtape too
And said he was partners with Game
The nigga finally told me what he said
He said he didn’t like it
But the niggas like
“See, see, look at you, look at you now, I tried to tell him you was tight”
Nigga probably never even gave it to him and shit
They say pressure bust pipes
And I ain't never had to deal with plumbing in my life, now that's a bar
Sparring with me like blasphemy to cathedral
Or colliding with the diesel with your baby in your arms
You would test me but you know better
It's inadequate to go against the Jesus of Nazareth
Of the rap game, and guess what, I got no cheddar
But my mind is like a wizard
I defy the laws of gravity every time I get high and write a sentence
Back teeth never been in agony, but I got wisdom
I have risen from the wicked to jump on the competition, Scorch ya, third degree burns next to their sideburns,
All sorts of combustible flows, firemen on speed dial
Free the leaders of the free world with a freestyle
Free the teachers, black activists get up off your feet now
And feed off my feelings
As I control my wheel like new power steering, so sincere
Tryna duck court hearings but I got big ears
Rap peers, used to study them wishing they would fuck with me
Now they can't fuck with him, I'm wishing good luck to them
Reluctantly these critics loving me and I don't blame 'em
They say, Kendrick you gunning for these niggas
So when I pull my weapon out, I give 'em the pleasure to see me aim it
And watch these bullets run into these niggas, clear the set
I got now, I got next, give you nouns, give you verbs
Give you adjectives while proposing an agitated threat
I am most debated in barber shops all because they slept on me
Big homie fear young, buck cause when I buck I make more than a buck
Dollars come quick like a fucking nun fucking for the first time
Put me in Alaska for six months in the dark, in my heart I know sun still shine
Still got a skill to be found in a gold mine
Too many relays for DJs to replay
I do the reject while I eject your new singlay
Hot enough to sit in hell, then unveil in heatwave
Piss on a demon with ice water
And if I lose my voice then I'm probably calling out to all P.A
Systems to assist in with the word I'm tryna spread
Like county jail bread or the legs of a hoochie
And that's off top like a toupee, I'm 2Pac
Coming back for doomsday, spitting at cops, go and cop my album
Get high to it, pop some valium, then turn up the volume
I influence ghettos where it says caution
And them bloggers get to sparking like L.A. females that's balling
Round the time this happens often, the violence get the flare
We racing against life, the turtle or the hare?
And nobody can compare to the legacy that we bout to build
Y'all work at Build-A-Bear soft as underhand pitching with skills
Nigga, nothing but the best
Every time we hit your tape deck niggas hit the deck
I rhyme like a fucking TEC-9,
And I 'Clown Posses' if they disrespect
You looking at a T-Rex snapping at 'em with Tourette's
Yeah, this the flow that killed aspiring rappers
Too late, I grab the eight and start expiring rappers
Some shit only BIG and Pac could rap after
And if they was alive, they would have to pay tithes
I am God
M.C.R. squares will disperse in despair, this is me motherfucker
The joke's on you, mothafucka
The loc is on you, mothafucka
I warned you, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
The joke's on you, mothafucka
The loc is on you, mothafucka
I warned you, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Soon as I enter
I put a hurting on it if I don’t kill it she injured
For a long time, summer, spring, and winter
Fall for anything, you clumsy-ass nigga
Jumping off the boat in some 87 Locs
She’s seen them hundred spokes and then that woman spoke
But I don’t talk back, I put my life on tracks
If that don’t work put your wife on track
Show me where the candle wax, it must be you
Cause I burn right through everything ya’ll do
High octane when I bring on my last name
Mr. Lamar AKA The Cash King
Quicker than pre-cum won’t you give her a reason
To not meet up with me like a vegan
Psst, Goddamn I’m the fucking man
She said fuck her man, now she fuck with Mann
All the spoons in my kitchen
Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend
Bend it girl, bend it girl
All the spoons in my kitchen
Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend
Bend it girl, bend it girl
It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, ya know?
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
I'm the oldest, nigga
And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Check it out
I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z
Until I finally realized that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
Because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'mma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
As an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focused
In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
Even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
But he always questioned when I'mma drop my debut CD
How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga
At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
It's a sacrifice I try to tell him
That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
Of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
I ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
I just wanna hear you heard
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard
What up DZYNE? I ain't forgot nigga
You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga
You believed in me first, that's what's for sure
At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away
And I was wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done
But I'm telling you we ain't done
Matter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to?
Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools?
People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning
With school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it
Me, you and Dave was on it
Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked
Time to be heard
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard
So can you feel it?
When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
Do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
Word to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave?
That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays
Like a dog in the night
Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
To grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
I spread love like a Hippy, but I'm a Black one
With Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible
Tabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't mad
You hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
Because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
I probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the city
My niggas, tell me you with me
And if you is won't you pop my CD in
Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard
Yeah, uh huh
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard
D-Dave, what up nigga?
Matt Jeezy, hahaha...
Kites on my radar, life in my palms
We unite through the chaos (Only for the purist)
Tell them to obey ours
My cerebellum threw a rebellion from AR's
(Room full of boom sticks)
The day I have a J.R., I tell him to work for God only
And quit his day job (Motherfuck the bullshit)
Radio never play ours
This revolution ain't televised with prayer
Jumping over borders (Woo!)
Ain't no ruler for restrictions, ain't no police to deport us (Uh!)
Ain't no summers for our sons, ain't no dealings for our daughters (Woo!)
Every prosecution hung, save the verdict for the lawyers (Uh!)
Illuminate the corner (Woo!), celebrate humanity
And scream back at me in the morning (Uh!)
Every field in Mississippi, every street in California (Woo!)
Know the devil is a liar, it's the time to be anointed (Uh!)
Truck into a stream, disconnected to a dream
Head bussin', hittin' nothing, even if I gotta bleed
Sittin' waiting patient for a universal pain
Politicking with the nation, this is big as you and me huh?
I let you find my contacts, okay
Tryna set us off for combat, no way
Waking up the spirit it's on every human being
If you with us, then you scream so one day you can shine way out!
Me, I'm way, way out
Way out, way out
From my eyewitness binoculars (uh-huh)
To Argentina and Africa (uh-huh)
We mastered the (what?) pressure (yeah)
Hazardous (uh-huh), harassing us (that's right)
You laugh at us (you did)
More accurate at bagging dimes, now we bagging rhymes
Bodybags, price tags on your forehead
Nine times out of ten, young niggas are nine or ten
When the line becomes thin: be a killer or fireman
Fill up the lavish pen if I needed to right my wrongs
I can't deny sin, condolences through these palms
I remember when your cousin was coming home
My bitch, why we plotted to kill him 'cause we ain't know him
Unfamiliar faces make niggas nervous
Convicted court cases might hit the surface
Restricted territories might come through lurkin'
We ain't want none of that urgent call
Well, I'ma act Turk and fall on my identity, percocets
For all the headaches, I'm 'bout to bring confetti
Tumble out this barrel soon as it ring, you ready?
That was the word 'for we moved on 'em
Treat him like Joe the Plumber
I wonder if someone come and can see this tool on him
Immature and retarded is what you call me
Your cousin wa'n't coming home from the pen but from the army
If I can right my wrongs and pen this verse I read
Even though a bullet hit him in the leg, still walk on by
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Uh, I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figured that I hit the NBA and make a fortune
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
501s, Louis letterman jacket
Little brother only 5, momma put him on my taxes
You know that Compton ghetto shit
That every section 8 tenant is familiar with
Ooh wee, they say he something like the 70s
But I'm from '87, with a thousand dimes
You got 80 sevens
Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
Fucking all my high school teachers
That was '05 bro
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A million bucks, and that's why
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it (Ho)
Uh, So give me fifty feet champ
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
I'm in the hot spot, I know they seats damp
And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
You-you niggas check this cash and I'm GT crashing
105 off-ramp, hey
And little nigga got it going on, G5
Going, going, going, gone
Cloud 9 mind state
I drop a record then I raise the crime rate
Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck skip to Y
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition of cool is
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
(Top Dawg, Money GANG)
Owwww, Dave, I see you, now see me
Look, I say I'm a millionaire
I'm a Top Dawg millia- no let me just come in unorthodox
I order plenty ammunition for the enemies that I got
I'm the King, I'm just looking for my Coretta Scott
Bet I pop, like a boy band, I'm annoying to rappers
Guess I'm poison to rappers, front on me, get bent backwards
Stomping on em' like a Kappa
Cap and gown, graduated with my Masters
So where do I go now
Swear there is no-nothing after
I'm the bishop, I'm the pastor, I'm the god MC
And you don't want to get caught in the rapture
I would probably burn your whole colony
Chew you up then spit you out
You nothing but a Polla Seed
Follow hood policies
Compton, California where the motherfuckin' riders be
You never seen a killer til' you seen one on side of me
That green on the side of me
Fuckin' all about my fuckin' money like a sodomy
Fuck them bitches properly
I do it
I do it, done it, run it like I grown legs by the hundreds
My pocket full of hundreds, I'm always hungry
Been hungry, I think a nigga need three stomachs
Bummy, NEVER
Middle of a conversation, I cough up a feather
And get ready for the detonation
I bomb on whoever
Whatever you bout, I'm bout it twice like a woman who give twins life
I steered right through your fan base every time
Tapping your demographic like I was Gregory Hines
Every line be tailor made, hella paid, count that money, several ways
I'm a beast, fuck a mansion, I rather live in a cave
Sasquatch is back, but what y'all really didn’t know is sasquatch can rap
Motherfucker, I'm iller
Ok, I squeeze the juice out a rapper and just squash this track
The people like "What the fuck happened and where Wayne be at?"
There's some boy named K Dot and he's a maniac!
I think his vocals is strapped, with a toolie, in fact
He spit like a Uzi, rat-tat-tat
He just shot me in my back, somebody pick up my back
I think that boy from Iraq, I think y'all boys better know that
He got it on lock like a Low Jack
Heading straight for the top like a ball cap
Y'all better fall back, y'all better crawl back where y'all came from
Ain't one better than the one who can write like Langston Hughes from the brain off top
Like a bottle dude, get a hollow, where you swallow food
Get a model, bet she swallow, who? Me
Bet she goggle like a scuba diver eyes in the sea
Recognize who I be, K. Dot motherfucker
Dot motherfucker, hot motherfucker, drop top when ya popped with the Glock
On sight motherfucker, sight motherfucker, ride motherfucker, die motherfucker
When I go pop, pop
Open up, close shop like a retail spot
Everybody know I be where the money lie, eat where the money lie, shit where the money lie, sleep where the money lie
Bitch that's no lie, let the truth be told
K Dizzle, the Big Sizzle, turn beats to stoves, burn up
Rappers: I'm iller
Dig it, like it, love it a lot
Reporting live, Compton California
The good kid
I'm tired of doing it the same way
Gotta Flip it before I ruin it
Make it all make sense
Before you put your 2 in it
Opinions get thrown out the window
With Ron Browz so turn me up loud
So the world can hear
And when your favorite rapper
Be rapping you should cover your ears
And go deaf, go deaf I said
Go death and stay dead
A shot to the forehead'll kill em
But I ain't here for no ignorance
I’m militant, as Martin Luther King
In the penitent, aiming for my dreams
Till a bullet bounce off
One of my deep thoughts
And hit a nigga in the spleen
I got it in my genes
You probably think I'm talking bout a pistol
But I'm talking bout the blood of a warrior
My nigga what you worry for?
I ain't trying to jock your swag
I'm trying to better my craft and stay relevant
Yeah, as time flies
Hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring
I'ma
Tell you why
It's important
I'm not the boring, (I'ma)
If I think and act like you do
The world would die
From not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on
What's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
The World
The Relevant
Id rather you call me that
Then a typical artist you call wack
On a Youtube blog holding AR's and stacks
Of one's but never could be the one
To rally communities or
Lead a crowd of blacks
Passion is to strong
Im pissed off
So there's a chance you get pissed on
R Kelly was in the wrong
But that dont make you an exempt
That dont make you a no go from hittin the fence
You ain't a blood and
Damn sure you ain't a crip
The crowd yell OH!
But I ain't a pimp
Im me, Im free as a 5 finger discount
See you on the flipside
Right after I dismount, if I
Ever feel like I ain't pushin myself
Ill find a cliff then push myself
Off the edge like a barber
At the tip of your head
Thats how I settle it
Life or death if I ain't relevant
Yeah, as time flies
Hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring
I'ma
Tell you why
It's important
I'm not the boring, (I'ma)
If I think and act like you do
The world would die
From not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on
What's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
The World
The Relevant
So feel free to not mind me
If your used to boosters
Drug dealers and shooters its on wax
Cause most of yall niggas fabricate facts anyway
I could have easily cheat and let the 44 play
Like a 2 on 2 orgy
But I been there and it bores me
Got to the point where it did nothing for me
At 40 I want to afford not to record bullshit
In my story, and Im mad young so Id rather do it now
Before my careers done, this is pain plus glory
Victory is here, if I cried
You could see strength and pride in my tears
I do it for the kids, I do it for the 23
Hour lockdowns doin time in the pen
And my pen is the only thing I got for
Hip hop to change the game
They'll remember my name as the relevant
Yeah, as time flies
Hope that I'm soaring
Far from the boring
I'ma
Tell you why
It's important
I'm not the boring, (I'ma)
If I think and act like you do
The world would die
From not seeing something new
And if I don't speak on how I feel
The world would lose out on
What's really real
And if I should die before I wake
I pray my music will take my place
The World
The Relevant
For all my niggas doing drugs
Fucking hoes and showing love
Pants still sagging to the floor
Sagging through your turf like I own this fucking earth
That's on my fucking life, I'm just living fucking life
This ain't House Party 5 but what's popping for tonight
I got a lil' more dough to spend
Let's rest in peace up on the LB like Nate did
Y'all ain't smoking y'all joking
Nugs big as Chuckie Cheese tokens and I'm toking
Bum house on Skid Row ain't this potent
Holy shit, I'm God-Scent, admire my stench
Cállate la boca in the presence of the most high (power)
Most high (power), Most high (power)
Yea you heard me right
True achiever, new Adidas still tryna earn my stripes
It's easy to assume we doing decent, true indeed
I'm not from here, I'm of Heaven descent
And you'd agree, as sure as one and two is three
You'd have this music down to a tee if you was me
It's 36 O's in a key
It's only one in Ab-Soul, still open doors
Don't forget the dash, I might leave you with a gash
I ain't doing no more shows unless I'm getting cash
Phillies full of hash, city on my back nigga
Fucked around and put Del Amo on the map nigga
Carson, Californication no travel agent
But every day's a vacation and mothafuckas hate it
I flew in, but I ain't complaning
And everyday I'm raining got the most precipitation
Soulo, Top Dawg Administration
Top Notch, Crock Pot Hot, wear your apron
Stop, watch, grab a stop watch, apply patience
And watch us pop across the population
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run this shit
Go and tell em Soul told em, lick a scrotum suck a dick
Down for what I'm up against, clowning when you see me styling
Joking, smiling, scoped your poker face through these black shades
(Smoking on hay) in the middle of the barn
At least I think so I can't quite remember where we are
All I see is stars nigga, All I see is stars
I don't know if I'm on the red carpet or on Mars
Shout out to my bitches givin' it up on the first date, Between 21 & 38 (Great)
Motherfuck the government, democrats, republicans
Can shove it up, where they take a shit, we in this bitch
In a sense, I'm militant with a trigger finger itch
Cause I'm always killing it, you see this shit in my cerebral I invent
It should be illegal, I admit, surrender quick
I wanna see hands and white flags no matter if you teach
Eighth grade or you move weight like a gastric bypass
Get a good look at my ass before you kiss it, sons of bitches
Get well acquainted with it, we gon' be here for a minute
HiiiPower, pissing on the Declaration
Of Independence and you can bet my John Hancock the biggest
Fuck a proposition, 'less it's in my best, interest
Kissing ratchets in the mouth, lift her dress and show address
Don't be so upset, show some love when you see a thug
Getting pita bread, I put the nina to your head
You heard what I said
Soul
If I said I'd be doing this at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be just the innocent Kendrick you've seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
I'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in a seat
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer, a doctor
Instead of a boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
And do 'em all if they gossip
Children on the corn, stay vandalizing the option
Of living a lie, driving their bodies with toxics
Constantly drinking and drive
Hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen coward the concept is aim it, then bang it, then slide
Out the bitch the deposit
The prize on his head that tithes probably'll go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the critics
And Snoop passed us the torch, I'mma burn you rappers with it
What's up?
This is the future, this is the future
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really... hold up
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk (Woo)
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
Just a lil' buzz, just a lil' buzz
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
See y'all don't understand me
My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
Cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
You can shoot shots or cheer cause I... am
For the record, I used to do a lot of humping when I was little
I got a lot of whoopings over that shit too, and that's random, but so what? Ha-ha
Gimme that beat fool, this a full time jack
No really this a Sounwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it
When you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag
And the critics thought they had me
Nah, I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged, a medium away from living large
Matter fact where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one
I'm on one, I'll make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
Good kid, mad city evil in my heart
From the blood niggas fucking with me, crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate
It's a legitimate reason why
I put on repeat Kanye's "Touch the Sky"
But I'll be looking past that I'm tryna touch God
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Y'all married to the game well I'm 'bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you going through something, this the shit you recite
This is bigger than life, this is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tour, bonjour, I mean war like that!
Yeah, straight like that
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)
In 2010, I'm tryna ball, nigga!
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga!
That's a quote from Ab-Soul
I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate, shall stay anonymous
Searching seven continents accomplishing big shit
Big ass, big tits she on me
And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies... homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga, my nigga Tony said
"Just do you, nigga!" Show and prove, nigga
And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure
'til they know you got the stinkiest stool, nigga!"
I ain't tripping I'm just tipping on fo-fo's
Back in the city and tipping on four hoes
That boy got a cold cold, he's sick con, slick on
Dropin red jewels like a school bar mitzvah, ooh
Straight like that
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)
Why y'all complain about OG's?
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop, not Dre, not Ice Cube
I don't care me and Quik went to the same school
I look in the mirror and do it myself
Like a self made nigga, I don't need a maid, nigga
Do I need a co-sign from Dre or Jigga?
They can make me much bigger
But do I need 'em though?, I just need a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost
"Me Against The World" on you mothafuckas
I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker
Uhh, tryna record my steelo
Even when I'm not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what I'm talking 'bout? I look at your Audemars
To put ya'll in time out, it's time to unveil the real
And your career is about as frail as Ms. Winehouse
Just salute, grab a flute, and pull the wine out, ooh
Just like that
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me?
Been a messed up day for me
Know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
I can bring him closer
Spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody killed my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I'll wait in front a homie's spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch the homie leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Man, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you play with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, man, I promise
You chip the homie, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back—
The screen reads: "This is a satire by Kendrick Lamar"
Run your life, I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice
On your life, I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice
Run your life, I live a--
Run your life (ahh)
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
Uh, you can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA is an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floor
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the camera
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder — these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Won't you tell'em I got millions on the way
Yeah
Say got work for Kung Fu Kenny
Know you got work, got work for plenty
Him got, her got, more got, Benji
Damn
Top off, getting topped off in the city
Big Top Dawg and I dance on 'em like Diddy
Pop off and I pop back like Fifty
Yeah
I gotta dance
I Milly Rock when I get that advance
How can I shop with like 64 M's?
Talkin' to Top about business again
He want some lot with new Bentleys again
I want some top from like two sets of twins
Twenty twin twins, yeah, yeah
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria, but I don't see it
I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic, tapped in when I'm maxed in
Comp-Town with the MAC 10s and the pumps in the background
Absent, never OG, standout
Lackin' everything else but doubt
Magnum, holding Magnums with a Magnum
Homie, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Boo yaow, boo yaow"
Never had friends, never had ends
Never had hope, they was like "nope"
I was like "boo yaow"
(Yeah, God)
Tee off the day
Know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
Throw me off, I be, "Off ya head"
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Burn integrity, burn your pedigree, burn your feelings
Burn your culture, burn your moral, burn your family
Burn your job, burn your land, burn your children, burn your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger
Ah! Ah!
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need you!
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you
Made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear—
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too
You the reason why mama and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love them
I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, you can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence?
Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple
You ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit
Or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas?
On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he would recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed"
You ain't try
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
(I want you more than you know)
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, "You crazy?"
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said, "Where's Ricardo?"
You said, "Oh, no, not the show"
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, "Oh, shit"
You said to me
I remember what you said too, you said
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick
You introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this
But I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract if that’s possible"
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know
Bitch, be humble (hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up, hol’ up, hol’ up)
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up, hol’ up, hol' up)
Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all
Bitch, be humble (hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up, bitch)
(hol’ up)
(hol’ up, hol’ up, hol’ up)
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up, hol' up)
Be humble
Sit down (hol’ up, hol’up, hol’ up, hol' up)
Heard a conversation with my father talking to his favorite partner
At the domino table, Tony had told him that he saw a
Young nigga hopping out busting like four charters
Popping pills, mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Sell it to a priest he probably can get it off by tomorrow
It's wicked when my favorite uncle kick it
Fiends trying to kick the addiction of sucking glass dicks
Vivid images go against any fantasy you can fathom
Phantoms ain't the only thing that suicidal
Open the doorway to his soul
Hit the hallway then hit the closet you see a rifle
Aim it at your arteries, pardon me, parts of me is pyscho
In retrospect my respect was a power ranger high note
Tumbling backwards into a karate kicking high note
My innocence would eventually see a hindrance
Surrenduring Ninja Turtles, pizza and Sega Genesis
Heard it over my bunk bed ear hustling
Something my papa said that caught my attention
His eyes red he's smoking on marijuana mixing the two eleven
He said I'm seven going on sixty-seven
The day I turned seventeen is the day that a lesson inside my lifetime
Come across a clothes line, every stick is a co-sign
Everything in the streets got the power to make me go blind
Even if he sat me down in the sun and gave me those eyes
Comprehend it well and I could smell the soberness evaporating by itself
He said, "Tony my biggest fear is to hear Kendrick disappeared in the fire out here and I didn't help
So if I can give him the game to hydroplane his decisions in life so he can go
Further than the streets and remain to be on the honor roll"
Sacrifice my life even if that shit, my mama though
Til the day he carried by the big six, domino
Backpack raps with gats in it
Don't get your cap peeled by the black menace
K Dot Thoroughbred
Move like a militant soldier
On point like a pyramid, force to be reckoned with
With the best shit
Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are
This is it
I'm in the lab cooking up all day, eff em up all day
Like a nympho, I been dope since s curl waves
Trying to convince hoes I got good hair
Knowing damn well there's chemicals there
I'm in the hood with the 17 year olds that's on hood patrol
And they want stripes so they shoot off bikes and you know
Any moment you can lose your life so kiss your kids or hug your wife or whatnot yo
I spawned with a dragon
He tried to throw his flame but I ducked and I stabbed him
Came out the battle laughing
That's a metaphor for any rapper who want it
I smack em 'til their nose is running
You know the hoes is coming if I'm there
And the hoes is cumming once we hit that hotel
That's no assumption, cool out before I move out
Hop on the 105 and do about 105 before your ass get threw out
The back seat
There's a dead guy on the freeway, oh it's not Dot
Tell the medics it's okay, a beast when the beat break
You probably think I'm dope like the it's the realest shit I wrote
But to me it's a throw away
I stare at them four walls and rap like I'm mad at God
Nice enough, I throw a spear at Nas, a jab at Jay
Matter fact, no, I take that back
See I don't play with real legends of rap like you do
And I'm crucial, concealed by real Crips and Soowoos
And they shoot, they photography students when beef get to brewing Compton!
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar
This for the town, nigga
Me, I'm from the Hub City, yeah, that Compton court building
Caught a murder when his homie died, judge caught feelings
I'm on Rosecrans, chilling right inside Best Outlest
Five dollar Little Caesar, momma shopped at Food-4-Less
Elementary McNair, say what's up to Vanguard
Centennial High, had me swimming with a pool of sharks
Me, I'm just a good kid, tryna keep it neutral
But I'm well aware that a square can get shot too
Most Crip and some Piru, that's just how the game go
Hood on every corner, stop for gas and get your brains blown
Bitches with fat asses, burning in the stashes
Murders in July, call that summer time madness
Rest in peace 4 Bent, rest in peace Mausberg
Swear to God, when I make it big, your voice'll be heard
Me, I'm just a good kid, tryna keep it positive
Though I know it's chaos, forever my heart will live in
E-S-T 1987, Dominguez Hospital that bitch was on Bullis Road]
Ayo, Kendrick Lamar, do it again
Alright, here we go, third take (Dead)
Rigamortus Remix, it feel good
Real quick Ali (Kendrick Lamar, fuck it up this time)
Haha, yeah
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him (Amen) Bitch
And this is rigamortis and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus, the Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme if you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight, we always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI, just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead, amen) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70's
Nigga, payback's a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
Solar system and barbeque, ain't nothing else you can do
(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I killed him
(He dead) Haha (Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) yup-yup (Amen) I know
(He dead) fo' sho (Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
I rapped him and made him Casper, I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster
Your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy
I assassin my casualty and it's casually done and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds don't talk to be 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me, recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity
And y'all fucks, never could hassle me and y'all luck, just ran out you'll see
(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure (Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure (Amen) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him (Amen) Amen
Still in the projects

There's no king of the projects

(Don't fuck around, don't fuck around, don't fuck around, don't fuck a...)
Shut your fuckin' mouth and get some cash, you bitch
You be in your feelings, I be in my bag, you bitch
Santa's reindeer better have some ass, you bitch
Everything I'm working, gotta be the
Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate

Lifestyles of the kid who never had shit
Living off that bad shit, that shoot shit, that stab shit
Rock a flag and don’t give a fuck about U.S flag shit
George Bush got some nerve, fuck a war, we trying to serve
Motherfucking 8 balls, til’ we live at the pool hall
And knock billiards out of your business, ya bitch
Thats my surroundings in Compton, have common sense
Smell death in the air, around here, thats a common scent
You know the gunpowder
You know when your homie barely blink, he just done powder
Only at seventeen
You know the common statistic inspired by hoop dreams
Now hire about street schemes, and getting blood money
I try my best to stay focused and hope the city love me
Pray it's not lust, cause if it is, I’d be death in a month
Lord forbid, for the good kid
They took his life
She want her baby back, like a cooked rib
But that’s just life, where I’m from
If there’s a shining star
Hope my city is not too far
So we can live again
See, where I come from is hard
Hope all over, we can start
So we can live again, so we can live again
I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible
Because it will reveal to you why it is true
That’s whatever the mind can deceive and believe
The mind can achieve
Regardless of how many times you may have failed in the past
Or off day your aims and hopes may be
Go getter, with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best?
Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress?
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of Buffy
When she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates

What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy awards as best dressed
With an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and start blastin'
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Ear hustle on a nigga that's constantly braggin'
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop 5 bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area or carry the birds to VA
Let the Clipse distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks flip three to six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a trump
Donald that is
So welcome to the story of my life
See I'm tryna get to get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and my wife
Pops engine in this old school run tiiight!
But as you listening to K-D-O-T
Man, me and my girl split the bucket of KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say is "Damn
These niggas that much better than me, baby?"
I don't think this is meant to be
Cause I'm always losing self esteem
She paused the iPhone then said, "Huh?"
I repeated what I said then she replied, "Shut up."
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones, Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success, I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Blessed are the bullies
For one day they will have to stand up to themselves
Blessed are the liars
For the truth can be awkward
Hold on Brother John
Too many mothers weepin'
Dream on Brother John
But in your dreams you can't be sleepin'
Ah, what you want with it
I, recognize that you’re on with it
I put your name in a song with it
Emoji through the phone with it
I ménage, nothing wrong with it
And now we’re late, when we gon’ get it
We up early in the morn’ with it
Early in the morn’ with it
I Brace yourself, baby rate yourself
But I know its only ten
Better you save yourself
Ain't no crying when that headboard start to bend
No lie, 4-5 for the game, we shoot uzis
Cinematic, might claim this on a movie
PG-13 don’t please me, P.S. no BS, I’m usually
Teasing myself or somethin’ like nananana
Once I get it I’m a selfish one like nananana
Jasmine only ride Aladdins like nananana
Then I’mma cuff that like one time
Only one time I’mma tell you, I’m
Kendrick Martin, Hootie Malcolm
I'm screaming out peace
But his chopper piece a bad outcome
I'm vicious, and my house is a red light district
And my couch is a porno star, out of town from Houston and Memphis
And I never gave a fuck and I never did fuck with y'all so I kept my distance
Just me and my day-ones, and a thousand ones for these strippers
Ho I been on my own, get on the song then pee on the song
My bladder is gone, I shatter your dreams
I'm Freddie it seems
My shadow is wearing expensive cologne
Pigtails and dookie braids, cabinet full of Kool-Aid
I'm ghetto as fuck and my pedal is up
But I'm gassing on all of you niggas man
Kendrick Martin, Hootie Malcolm
I'm screaming out peace, but his chopper piece a bad outcome
Stale face, how come?
Is it cause I do me? Or your main bitch wanna do me?
Face shots - we call it Call of Duty
K-Dot now bitch give me two feet
Made my bitch come give me two G's
Raised by wolves and we do eat
Play by rules and you might live
And I try to do this shit for the kids
But y'all got different prerogatives
And y'all rot in hell
And I dwell where the fortune live
And that's vicious
This is illusion by the Patron
Chopper cocked and I'mma clap mine
Homies in the pen ain't never coming home
Creamed out car from the Chevron
Me and my mama in the county line
It was food stamps, now it's passport stamps
Bout to come back to the deuce line
Told you we'll blow like deuce nines
BSM - we cannibals
Eat your flesh, no antidote
Kendrick - that's family though
We on Rosecrans, it's a party ho
This right here's that Martin-Malcolm
Only difference we still alive
By any means necessary, squad life we down to ride
Interstate, rival Pi's
Seen them tears on my mama's eyes
Do whatever it takes to keep my daughter fly
I'll do whatever it takes to be immortalized
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
These hoes want to love me, man
So I'm like, what up? Uh what up?
Uh, bitch I do this remix stupid, fire burning, people looting
That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses
Chucking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won
Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously
I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude
You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you
Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC
I'm 'bout to make that halo burn, now goddamn that's some irony
I am the messiah of society
Beside a Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui
I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief
Like beliefs of Mason Betha, reporting from C-P-T motherfucker
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
Bumping some Sade rolling my window down and hitting the highway
No it's not Friday, but it's my day and sometimes shit gotta go my way
Niggas got me fucked up thinking that my music don't stick like some nunchucks
Top Dawg and we All Stars like we run Chucks, but nevermind that
Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio is where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game till I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit, haters die young you can run to the pulpit
Pullin off the pit stop, card like a flip flop
Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot
I don't even trip though I don't need no company
Me, I'm thinking long-term tryin' build a company
Kendrick the Good Kid
As I move
I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn if she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today
Nigga what I compose be so potent
That if the Earth dried I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on the jet ski and start Westcoastin'
I'm not boasting or bragging
Not a person, I'm a dragon
Taking action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came, tell him that I'll be alright
I'm so high off life that I can OD
Walk outside then sniff a whole key
Oh lady don't call the police
It's just the Average Joe walking with his heart on his appendix
Don't be afraid to speak
So to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach
Y'all midget macks swingin' on Shaq now have a seat
You can never co-exist with my mommas oldest
Kendrick be thy name I got my mind right
My nigga locked in the pen that's why my mind write
Ink over my brain, Wussup!
So let me start off the third verse
Pickin' off your favorites since I'm cursed
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissing
Fuck you because you don't see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too because she's cute
And the ass look like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches
Fuck niggas who can't fight so pull triggers
Fuck the new world gas price that costs a living
Fuck your love, fuck your hate, fuck your snitching
And whether you fuck with me or not
I don't give a fuck you could keep your props
Fuck keeping it real, I'mma keep it K.Dot
Kendrick everyday, Jay-Z didn't lie
Fucka!
Like the waters in the open sea
When tribulations come all we can say is hopefully
And yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me
But today I'm overly dedicated, I'm 'posed to be
A testimony for broken hearts in the city
You either crash landing or planning on flying with me
Misery loves standing behind its company, well
Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell
On our past encounters, reaching over the counter
Told me that it's a appealing to pop a pill, that's a downer
I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep
I heard when you see a thug, that's what you try be
Got these burdens under my wings, but I'm still free
Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray I'll look you in the eye and say
(Tha Biz—Tha Bizness)
Let 'em die
Dead
Black Hippy
We don't give a fuck
Hell nah, nigga
This conglomerate so cool, Rock, we could freeze L.A., nigga
Black Hippy
Move in
Kendrick Lamar
I tell 'em like this
Ring the alarm or wake to a bomb
You ain't a rapper, you Elton John, holding your john
I got a ton of croutons in the Louis Vuitton
That's big bread, the chickens are flying, flocks when I come
You niggas don't keep it real, you fake as Pamela's titties
I pound kitties, then hit the club with dogs with me
Tan Polos, no socks, chopped Dickies
Tan coupe, no top, bumping Biggie
... However you want, whenever you want, you all can get it
Contagious, it's mad syphilis, blazing, it's God-giftedness
Die over death sentences, flow hot, plus, the beat knock
Like Jay witnesses, tell 'em I killed the witnesses...
Take a trip with the narcoleptic
Suffered insomnia, but this time it was only seconds
I see thermometers boil as you lay in the desert
Of eternal fire hate ya then deny yourself of a blessin'
Meanwhile I'm on a new cloud chunking the deuce
Renewed vows with sinners, homies, enemies too
Gold towel under my feet clicking the fluke
With a thousand troops, Crip and Piru, nigga, woop, woop
Love I depend on, white doves I depend on
They flying through this endzone that meant on to vent on
So listen, homie, you miss me with that bullshit
I keep my distance, homie, I am on a higher pulprit
You cannot visit, homie
I mean the beauty of heaven is far for me not to exit
It's ike an anti-depressant, you see the vision, homie?
I mean this godly advice, fucking right
Even if you pinch me twice, yes I, keep dreaming
Lovely lullabies
I don't see another thing but starry skies
And louds of clouds beneath my wings and in the skies
As far as hazy as can see the sun will rise
And illuminate this life, this life
Oh why do I have to return to reality?
Oh why, this time I'll try
I'll try not to wake up from this dream
I’ll try not to wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
I won’t wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
I can’t wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
I won’t wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
(Dream, dream)
I will not forget
Fixating the part of faith I've never met
And explaining away the reasons as I slept
So beautiful here I wish I never left
I never know which one's a lie, this life
Oh why do I have to return to reality?
Oh why, this time I'll try
I'll try not to wake up from this dream
I won't wake up from this dream
I can't wake up from this dream
I won't wake up from this dream
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
To wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
I won’t wake up from this dream
As I play out the Commodores, my faith destroyed
My heart don't work, I'm unemployed
The feeling is void, don't know what I need
Some pussy, some paper, some counseling
Maybe some Henny, some weed
I'm looking for you, I'm checking for her
I'm parking lot pimpin', I'm honking at women, I'm all on the curb
Skrt, skrt, skrt, pump my brake, pump my brake
Mini skirt, skirt, skirt, don't walk away, walk away
I'm fishing for compliments
This is a fairy tale, I know you very well
Fuck all your promises, I know what time it is
I'm just a realist, I am the realest
Reality is fatality cursed on the future for family, wife and some kids
I'm looking for you, I'm checking for her
I'm parking lot pimpin', I'm honking at women, I'm all on the curb
Skrt, skrt, skrt, pump your brake, pump your brake
Mini skirt, skirt, skirt, don't walk away, walk away (I promise)
Might sound weird
But a great night, you in a real relationship, you understand what I'm saying
A great night with somebody you love, is difficult
Somebody you like is always good
Like is wonderful
You come home with some juice, with the woman you like:
"Can I have some juice?"
"Gimme that juice, pour juice all over me"
Pour that juice all over that sexy body"
Let you be together three years and shit
"Can I have some juice?"
Bitch, why you want my juice?
You know I'm dehydrated
I try to come home and shit
Tryin' to get some juice you want my juice...
Whoo Ha!
Backpack raps with gats in it
Don't get your cap peeled by the black menace
K-Dot thoroughbred
Move like a militant soldier, on point like a pyramid
A forced to be reckoned with, fuck with the best shit
Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are
This is it, I'm in the lab cooking up all day
Fuck 'em up all day like a nympho
I been dope since S curl waves
Trying to convince hoes I got good hair
Knowing damn well there's chemicals there
I'm in the hood with the 17 year-olds that's on hood patrol
And they want stripes, so they shoot off bikes
And you know any moment you can lose your life
So kiss your kids and hug your wife, and what not yo
I spar with a dragon, he tried to throw a flame
But I ducked, then I stabbed him and came out the battle laughin'
That's a metaphor for any rapper who wants it
I smack 'em til their nose is running
You know the hoes is coming if I'm there
And the hoes is cumming once we hit the hotel
There's no assumptions
Cool out before I move out, hop on the 105
Do about 105 before your ass gets threw out the back seat
(There's a dead guy on the freeway)
Oh, It's not Dot? Tell the medics it's okay
A beast when the beat break
You probably think I'm dope like this the realest shit I wrote
But to me, it's a throw-away
I stare at the four walls and rap like I'm mad at God
Nice enough to throw a spear at Nas
Launch at Jay, matter fact, let me take that back
See I don't fuck with real legends in rap like you do
I'm crucial, concealed by real crips and suwoo
And they shoot like photography students when beef gets to brewing
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them
Straight up, Don't get ate up
Put rappers in quicksand, Dot leaned on 'em like kickstands
I'm so hot, kids put me in their iPod
Even atheists play my shit and say, "My God, Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, he's nice"
Don't compare me to them, just compare me to Mike Jordan
When I record and the verse and the chorus is ill
You can land in lab of fortune when biting my skills, playa'
Watch I lay-up bar after bar like I'm trying to build a gate up
See me on the way up like an elevator, I'mma let you take the stairs
That metaphor meaning I'm already there (Greatness)
I'm in the booth with an apron
Cooking up shit like Martha Stewart was my bitch, Amen
Stay on the curb like a spray day tan?
Blowing herb with my nigga Herb, Fuck what you niggas heard
We the new West Coast Wu Tang bitch and I'm the best
Think less, You can suck my dick
Who from the West can kill it like us? Give me their name
Now I take 'em to the house of pain, Top Dawg headquarters
Is it real, son? Is it really real, son?
Is it really real, son? Is it really real?
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
Tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
You rappers got nothing for me when Sound-Sounwave record me
Every MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them
Back in the projects
Back in the projects
I lost it all, all, all, all
Now I'm back in the projects
I can't get all of you in it
Big slugs, hardcore drugs
Everything crooked, what you thought this was?
Steam pot, turned powder into rock
Plan go sour, that's how you get got
Aww shit, got it poppin' into bricks
Part of playing cool now it's time to get rich
Keep in mind, never walk 'round blind
I can't get all of you in it
All that back and forth gets me hot sometimes
Wanna see somebody get knocked out, just box one time, shit
Catch a fade, catch a fade, it ain't nothin'
Get your head up, at the gym, bring your knuckles
Look, I'm deep inside the projects where it's brackin' at
You know the zip
Where we take a quarter piece, flip it, 'til the corner lit
A1 yola, that fresh over the border shit
Shoot outs and abortions, situations so unfortunate
I knew a nigga, doin' double digits, bust the head wide
For another nigga who's scared to rep his set right
Now in solitary, doin' push ups by his bedside
All he want is a Green Dot, his homie keepin' himself fly
Don't come around without your pass, niggas on they tip
Zero tolerance on niggas money, niggas want they shit
Don't start nothing without your blower, that's a one way trip
Six feet under, real life, that's all gunplay is
That is that hood shit
When young niggas on that misunderstood shit
Jumpin' out of smokin' rentals, Ks with the wood grips
Bitches for them bank statements will come and hit a full split
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
I can't get all of you in it
Niggas jaw-jacking, they ain't on that hood shit
Bitch we 'bout that action, on that wish you would shit
All red flags, swag on ten
We ain't in the club, we can't get our goods in
So we in the hood, lituations look grim
One time circlin' for colors of your skin
Black lives matter out here, no way
Cops get promotions while the family gotta pray
It's fucked up, can't explain, babies all in a dump truck
It's all about that money mane, miss me with that Trump stuff
Tryna make a dollar outta fifteen, don't get fucked up
It's shake in the bag, get a bud then you lucked up
You fakin', you mad, you got a issue, you get fucked up
Get laid on yo' ass, you feeling bad, your blunt's crushed up
We in the set, just bickin' it like the Cosbys
Tryna get dope, live happy days like Chachi
If you get a call from papi, that's like Jesus callin'
All you do is execute, next ten seasons ballin'
You can get the world, stay loyal, why you even trip?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
I can't get all of you in it
24/7, 365, Kendrick Lamar is always right on time
Oh, you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horse's mouth, you'll never understand me
I told you the plan B was to win your hearts before we win a Grammy
These days ain't shit changed, different toilet - same shit
And I drunk a whole gallon of laxatives by accident just to shit on you has beens
Had it been for my past tense I wouldn't be rappin'
But now I'm here, GQ, man of the year
Livin' in America
Thuggin' in the trap
Livin' in a groove
Watchin' TV
Dedicated to the homies in the pen', hit me!
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yay yay
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
(And I love myself)
Uh, when you lookin' at me, uh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy think they high
(I love myself)
Uh, one day at a time, sun gon' shine
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, huh
(I love myself)
Uh, when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated hands of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, sun gon' shine
When they say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line full of fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
(These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation)
Ah man
(I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis)
Uh, dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
(I love myself)
Huh, when you lookin' at me, uh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, sun gon' shine, everybody, hit me!
(Walk my bare feet, walk my bare feet)
(Down, down valley deep, down, down valley deep)
(Fi-fie-fo-fum, fi-fie-fo-fum)
(My heart undone, my heart undone)
Oh man, hey check this out, this a real Compton thing goin' on right now, ya feel what I'm talkin' bout? Ya dig that? Sometimes I just get a little bit beside myself, you know what I'm talkin' bout? This here's the return of Enoch, and we gonna do it to you like this, here we go: one, two, three, hit me!
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right
War last night
I've been dealing with depression, duckin' every other blessin'
I could never see the message, I could--
I could never take the lead, never bob and weave
Negative letting them annihilate me
Evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my--
Money in the ceiling lay my body in the street
Glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make everybody scream, "I love myself!"
I lost my head
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry
Ah man, ay, ay homie, I told you it's a straight up Compton thing, ya dig what I'm talkin' bout? And this here is dedicated to the homies. Y'all feel what I'm saying? And sometimes I just get beside myself. The return of the Enoch is back, you hear what I'm talkin' bout?
Uh, I've been lookin' for you my whole life, appetite
For this feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
In a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Something's got me losing my mind
Where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was 17 with the .38 Special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day
I could be your advocate
I could speak for you if you tell me what the matter is
I could preach for you with the mighty tongue
I'm the one, how can I, overcome
Negative energy while I give infinitely and survive?!
Music is my life
The reason why I write
Like Edgar Allan Poe on the beat, like a parasite
You thought a parachute made my flow just fall out the sky
Then you fell apart into a body part no one would buy
Nobody tried my limits 'cause they're afraid of heights
The ambition, weak or gravity, let 'em die
I let you live until a nigga compose a rhyme
Then it's like a rhino in your ass every time
Time and time again I treat my pen like The Pen
Bars harder than Pelican Bay and I been
Servin' a life sentence since the day I was ten
Nine times outta ten you only ten songs deep before you leap
Into a pool of sharks then swim
That's an analogy on the way I do casualties
And I do this shit casually, before the verse end
I'll be in the Hall of Fame with my picture framed, friend
Yeah, and I love it (I love music)
I'mma be quiet (I love music)
Ssh
And I love it (I love music)
Show enough love (I love music)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I swear you people don't know Kendrick, you don't know him
But you say you want some more Kendrick, I'm 'bout to show 'em
Everything inside this human being, I'm still growing
I'm a premature baby in this crazy life that we adore
Doors on the Lamborghini, I want 'em
Can't afford 'em so I tell the swap meet to clone 'em
I guess I really am a vanity slave
I guess my ancestors turning in they graves
Burning money when I get it, fuck a life savings
Overdraft bank statements, just to make a statement
When I put this fashion on, I'm a fashion junkie
Picking cotton in the country, I bought this out the country
Whips and chains, whips and chains, Jacob know my name
He call me Kunta, you my brother, we come from the same modern world
That's ya girl? I see she rocking Fendi
Try this on
If it ain't upscale then you may offend me
Copping everything in sight, ignoring they sacrifice
Amnesia if I see the black visa in my hand tonight
I show my dick and then I swipe, that's a punchline
They was hot and I wore ice, that's ironic huh?
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26's
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
It's the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, (Burr! Burr!)
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
Aw man videos got me wanting hoes
Appetite for flashing lights, all I can do is pose
A black male... on Melrose. I should get blackmailed
By my people hell rose, Niggas that ain't had shit
For 400 years overcompensate by over accessorizing with gear
Man y'all don't see my vision
I do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches
Am I a hypocrite cause everyday I'm contradicting
I think of how I'm living, then I watch "How I'm Living" I know this can't be right
My conscience tell me to stay righteous
It's unlikely to see what I like and say I don't like it
Biggest dilemma my priorities ignoring me, I wanna move accordingly
But baby steps are premature remember?
I'm flying to the south and I'll be gone 'til November
To see my family tree but this a shame I'm yelling, out, timber
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26's
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
It's the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, (Burr! Burr!)
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
Cold, oh so cold
How ironic he bought it then sold his soul
Is it masonic for your vice to take it's toll?
The remote control is taking control
Lift up the doors
That Lamborghini I wanted come with a dumb ass model that in vogue
I like 'em both, I'll wife 'em both
Take these motherfucking Jordan's off, put on my loafs
Cause nothing goes bad, everytime I wear (Gucci)
I'm getting more ass, everytime I wear (Gucci)
They told me it's a fad, everytime I wear (Gucci)
But should I give a fuck when it bring me more coochie?
This a young nigga's pedigree, I pray the lord can better me
If not he 'bout to strike me down like this my third felony
The voices keep on telling me, Kendrick don't forget about us
I burned my wardrobe, hoping that I could live without it
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26's
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
It's the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, (Burr! Burr!)
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
Rollin’ in a broken Mitsubishi with no AC
And a couple stolen TV’s and a seatbelt for my safety
Play the passenger, I think it’s five years after eighty-
Seven, do that math, 92, don’t you be lazy
I’m looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stopped for a second
Then it rekindled like the flame from a trick candle
Everybody got dental insurance, ‘cause we bout to floss
You get the couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar, but should not today
Them Dayton spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello, my Mr. Myiagi, I want them Kenwood Woofers
Say that you got me
If not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bullseye like a Taurus is
Murder was the melody, you should know what the chorus is
You really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out?
He said “Lil nigga, today the poor is rich”
Don't tell your mom that you seen a molotov bomb
And if she asks, just know that you have to lie
And son, don’t forget:
You from Compton
Brace yourself, I take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I’m slinging brick and moving cane
Cul de sac and plenty Cognac in major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that’s weighing on your brain
It was me, O-Boog and Yaya
Lucky, ride down Rosecrans
Ugly, waving yo hand out the window, brace yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans
Euphoria can slow dance
Society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Light skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where (mmm) hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed a nine
Pakistan on every porch, it’s fine
We adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
Sliding door, fuck is up?
Fucking shooting forth, if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk
Picking up the fucking pump
Picking off you suckers, suck a dick
Die a sucker punch, a ball of bullets coming from
AK’s, AR’s, Aye y’all; duck
That’s what Mama said when we was eatin’ that free lunch
Aw man, god damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in ‘94, fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
And no peace treaties just peace and BG’s appearing to prove
Bodies on top of bodies, IV’s on top of IV’s
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolly, your color’s correct
Make sure each corporate knows they’ll be calling your mother collect
Now, what you expect?
My life is a threat
Good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Life or death, is you with me?
Tim Westwood, what's up
Man we breaking all the rules, Take that bullshit elsewhere
Welcome to America, die or pay for healthcare
I'm tryna tell ya, we living in hell here
And if you agree with me, Let me get a hell yeah!
Hell yeah! (Yeah) Hell yeah! (Yeah)
Hell yeah! Let me get a hell yeah
I'm tryna tell ya, we living in hell here
And if you agree with me, Let me get a hell yeah
Mothafuck the government, mothafuck the system
Mothafuck you, I'm just living how I am living
Hiiipower, that's a nigga religion
'til Jesus come back and he tell me something different
This, this, this
Should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential
Life’s a bitch, life’s a bitch
But I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
My dick hard, her pussy wet
And I’m born with my dick in the earth
You can tell me how much am I worth
I’mma die with my heart on my sleeve
Many die on their hands and their knees
And I’m takin’ whatever I need
And I’m raping the government fees
And you’re wasting your time
And I’m speaking my mind on whatever I think
And I think that I’m Richard Pryor
With priors of 32 fiends
And that means that I hear for higher
Tell me why are you starin’ at me?
Matta fact, man, your eyes is wired
You inspired by Kendrick the king
Maybe it’s ’cause I’m living my dream
Man, I sing what I’m living about
And the words that come out of my mouth
They requires a random routine
Of being organic granite
Then my access is granted
To represent the shit that I conceive
And I guarantee that I’mma bring
My mind, body, soul
And I sold all these records off bein’ myself
And I wish you can do the same thing, man
It’s easier than a stripper
Or tyin’ a baby shoestring, you stringing along
And really why you writing a song?
Your passion for music is never in sync
No secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
And they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit?
You'll get relief
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
My dick hard, her pussy wet
I'mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)
And I see that you envy of me
Enemigos don’t prosper
Better yet, they do die eventually
If I’m at the event you will leave
‘Cause you know and I know that
I go ham even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I’m near you
But I don’t hear you, can you at least breathe?
With an oxygen mask, and
The masses keep saying I’m speaking for them
And if you can imagine my madness
Then you can see where I’ve been
And the places the Louis has been
And I swear I been doing this when
You was in pajamas, watching B-Barney and Friends
And you couldn’t harm me even with ten
Weapons of your choice riding in
Army tanks, you shot blanks
And I shot back, make your duplex bend
What the fuck you think? If I don’t think
Then I’m right back where the city sin
What the fuck you drink?
Thinking I can’t write these raps in the Lions’ Den
When I hear that you lyin’, then?
It’s murder she wrote, ain’t no hope
You go downhill, man, where’s your slope?
Get thrown downhill tied to a rope
Tell the world to put intervals
Man, I swear this the anecdote
And they tell me that life is a bitch
Who gives a shit when you know?
And I see that you envy of me
Don’t prosper, better yet, they do die eventually
Cause you know and I know that I go ham even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I’m near you
But I don't hear you, can you at least breathe?
(Hi, ho!)
(Bye, ho!)
So in conclusion
Sometimes we lose focus
Planning our whole demise
We’re getting the big picture and making it the wallet size
So to what's important in my life, I apologize
I hope to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted
The question is would you bounce back, or bounce back wards?
You wouldn’t know how to act or would you take action?
That's just a part of life and if your vision's impaired
You'll probably lose it all tonight
I got... Rottweiler in tube sock
Pitbull... lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die
Boxer... you take mine's off then hallelujah
Shando, count my blessings, spin around two times
Freaky... freak like it's the 80s
Fuckin' explicit, radio prolly say we
Should tone it... down with the clean version
Dirty... but in public you're like teen virgin
I like it... make me realize my vices
Enticin', flower bombin' all on your privates
Private... meetin' inside your bedroom
Head in that Maybach boomin', thank God for leg room
It's a trophy in that pussy, I'mma cum in first place
I'mma cum in first place, cum in, cum in first place
I'm your D-O-double-G and I need more Pedigree
What it D-O? Puppy chow, I've been grown and so off the leash, ho
In due time I'm the modern day Albert Einstein
I'm prime time like Deion
And the rest of y'all is peons
I pee on the best
Whoever you are you can step
Like a prosthetic leg
I see monsters in my head
That's why I rap with such aggression
I tear down studio sessions
Rappers scared, they walk in the booth
With a bible and a reverend
I use my mouth as a weapon
Bullets rip through your mid section
Rat tat a tat tat tat rata tat tat tat
I'm a Comptown, nigga get a casket
Go against me, that'll lead to my advantage
Because I've got to eat
And for real I'm feeling kind of famished
Hotter than the earth core, don't show me where no fan is
Show me where your fans is so they can see the real
I'm sick and electrifying, that's double ill
Me feel like me will be a legend like Will was a legend
But I'm not an actor, put that in my will
Gimme a second uncut coke lyrics what I'm stressing
She want the raw so I fed her lines like Kevin
Tell 'em I'm a werewolf, behold the 5 6 bigfoot
Lear jet overlook the country like Garth Brooks
Lyrics on point, plus I got the right hooks
Like Tommy Hearns, punchlines burn
I'm not concerned about the SoundScan
Cause most of y'all is drowning
A lifeguard that's lounging
Meaning I don't worry about none of you rappers
I'm way more live
That's evil backwards
Now with that great word play
I tend to let my words play
Like children on a Saturday
It's sad to say you're not up to par
And I don't play with mini golf and sharks
Jump inside the pool of sharks, we're biting off your head, your heart, your legs, arms
Bled like Jay Rock or Big Wy
And make sure you wear a vest
Because they my family ties
Suit up
You got a three piece? I got a three piece
A MAC-11, a 9 mili, and a DE
He backpedaling like a DB
I'm such a Martian
Call me ET
Always behind it like I own the TP
I shit, fart, pee pee
On anybody track
Walk in the booth and drink down a fifth of Ex-Lax
Wassup
Now phone home
My nigga Punchline is on, wipe 'em down
I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
Big marbles, nigga
I lead this new generation, boy
Don't argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors, authors and novel spitters
And it's all for the literature
And it's all for the hideous
The nastiest flows, the chlamydia, uh
I ain't afraid to say I need you, ah yeah (Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
I promise I'd never leave you, ah yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes
I write for sure, my folks unite
Soon as the flow get nice
The poltergeist that scare emcees
My prototype for every
My share of D's and R.I.P
She know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently, my appetite stay famished
Bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen (Look over your shoulder)
Boldest lines in rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
Supposed to shine, remind I'm king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pro's the con's, the diamond rings
The forward time, but I'ma bring
The soul divine and cross between
What's your's and mine's, the gold, the green
The roads that show just what it mean
That grabbed Shakur and by the wing
And fly before my vocal scream!
For hip-hop, look at my Ziploc bag full of goodies
You Chris Rock
Hit the pookie and pit stops
Since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders
When they fuck you over
It's love, I know ya
Motherfucker this is Watts, California
Gangbang murder state
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya
You ain't prepared when it go down
You already dead right about now
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya
If you're prepared when it go down
Then you know it's Jay Rock turn now
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya
You ain't prepared when it go down
You already dead right about now
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya
If you're prepared when it go down
Then you know it's Jay Rock turn now
What up? Lemme catch the beat
What up? Swag, swag, Based God I hear you
What up? Swag, swag, yeah, G shit
Westside, huh, look
I'm beyond the most slept on, stepped on
Stepsons, father of rap songs, writing my wrongs
Writing in the book of psalms
This is the word, word to the holy Qur'an
Or whatever that's foreign to ya
I find it funny that you are embracing a storm, wait
Ring the alarm or wake up with a bomb through ya
It's Baghdad kids with bad dads, cops with bad badges
Big bullets, no "My bads" once them guns shoot ya
I said, "Yo, I might go hard as the Mike Jordan
Lace up my Jordans and yellin' out ISO"
Ike Turner your idol, whip 'em and bruise 'em
Stick poison inside his pie-hole, sad that you knew him
We influence the heart of thousands, 999,000, but who's counting
Thirsty for success and we drink from the youth fountain
Big headed, tryna stay grounded like a delinquent in middle school clownin'
Drownin' MCs, they want life jackets
While we swim backwards we yellin' "Nigga, please!"
Pay your respect or recognize the alphabet
You can't survive in a room full of g's
Coached by my uncle, Lil Mane, I resemble him
They tryna tilt the game and we killing all Thebes
Make 'em all blood, make 'em all bleed
Motherfucker die, put a ribbon in the sky
Till Stevie Wonder sing, king of all kings
Jokers and new jacks can get dealt with
Royal flush when I drop shit and say these things
Mad leaning on 'em 'cause half of these niggas Maybelline
All made up, 'bout to go dummy
On a dummy, what, what, treat him like a welterweight
And stuff him in some trunks, you fucking with a giant
I'm Forest Whitaker sparring with some Forrest Gumps
What you want?
And I ain't fucking with you niggas 'cause I see y'all hoes
Cyhi, let's get it
Watch how I kill them with the funky rhythm
Embalming fluid fill 'em
Piranha's in 'em
Peep my persona as I
Get deep as Nostradamus
You stalling? Like the '89 I-I-Isiah Thomas
I'm ballin', cut up your pajamas if you sleepin' on me
I promise no peekin' homie you tryin' to confiscate the flow, I know
So, I switch it quicker than my bitches in mini skirts that want your attention
One thing for sure, they gon' get it
I'm cursed with the world's negatives
Probably thinkin' I'm hurt but that's the only way I can live
More money, cash, drugs, got me feeling like Ace walking inside the club
Paid in Full, MOB license plates
38's slug hugging my waist like it had arms
Then I bear it so I guess it really does
No paper work on this marriage, but I'm in love with life corruptions rather than life (woah)
Oh, you ain't know? I need that
More money, more drugs I need that
More murder, more guns I need that, wondering how I live with the world's negatives
This the last days my nigga
We livin' in the life where crime pays my nigga
So all I can say is get paid my nigga
Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most?
Mamacita had a bangin' body
Drove a black beamer, present from her baby daddy probably
He knew the nigga from high school
10th grade? they was cool, fell out over a dice game
She knew that but still wanted him to penetrate through that
Shorty wait, me and your man go way back
She said so what? He don't need to know what go on between us besides, I just wanna fuck
She blew his mind
Know what? we can exchange digits
Lets hook up later pay one of them hotels a visit
She seemed more than interested, more like desperate to be intimate
Either she this polite or his lucky night
Got the champagne sittin' on ice
Room 112 fuckin' all night then interrupted by her baby daddy and some niggas that he fuck with
Got him for everything, pussy's a negative
Adam & Eve, he should've known
Oh you ain't know? you need that
More pussy, more hoes you need that
Even if it's dirty pussy you need that
Wondering how he lives with the world's negatives
This the last days my nigga
We livin' in the life where crime pays my nigga
So all I can say is get paid my nigga
Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most?
We livin' in hell waiting on heaven but you don't know so
Might as well try to accept it, go with the flow oh
This life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)
Seem's like we never see home, you know?
So we screaming
This life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)
Goes out to everybody that know about bad habits
And willing to accept them as a fatal attraction, what a reaction
Rolling with the punches that life gives us and end up like Ke$ha's
Liver cirrhosis, matches givin' us cancer
Bitches givin' us gono-rrhea
I promise to practice safe sex, momma, don't cry
They say the good die young but a crackhead live a long time
So I crack open a beer keg, take that bitch to the head
Sippin' it slow hopin' it prolongs my soul
And that's crazy yo
When heat is on, I put on a coat
Then take it off when it's about to get cold
I've adapted to my environment, murder environment
20 years worth of it so I gotta love it, you can't blame me
Negative energy, public pulled by evil string
As I open a bible I start to sing
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off momma forgive me
I can't be held accountable that negative's be gettin me down
Got me rolling with guys, making g's
Got me tellin' lies that sound true come test me
This the last days my nigga
We livin' in the life where crime pays my nigga
So all I can say is get paid my nigga
Money ,murder, or dope which one you love most?
We livin' in hell waiting on heaven but you don't know so
Might as well try to accept it, go with the flow oh
This life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)
Seem's like we never see home, you know?
So we screaming
This life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
So I'm gonna do my thing (Try to continue living)
A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
But I'll be damned if I give 'em my handout
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye
If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried
What? Uh
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
It seems like, you can't win for losing
Whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"
Sick of pursuing, that your time will soon come
Nobody knows the position that you in
But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
That feeling, hard to explain
When you just, just want to get away
Something like
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the studio couch now, thinking bout my daughter
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
Instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
As I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
Nothingness surrounding me, living my life
Though it's better to write
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
'Cause I ain't about to roll it if I ain't rollin' that fire
Yeah the sun is goin' down but I'm tryna take you higher
We both know this house could never be a home
But ain't you sick of spendin' all your nights alone?
If it's lovin' that you want, girl, I promise you desire
No conversation when I come around
Run my fingers through your baby hair
I wanna take you there
For sure, you know what it's about
We'll find our limit when you say we're there
I wanna take you there
You toot it up, I tear it down
You bring it back, I wear it out
Hit it like whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop
Baby, you're the finest
Pussy taste like diamonds
How'd you get so timeless?
Wanna get behind it, behind it
Remind ya, I know how to find it
Hit it how you like it
Show you how we slide, how we slide, back in L.A., L.A.
Park circle, that way
Ready for the showdown, the Wild Wild West way
Ooh, you know you're flame
And I put that on my last name
I'ma take my time in it, climb in it for the day
No conversation when I come around
Run my fingers through your baby hair
I wanna take you there
For sure, you know what it's about
We'll find our limit when you say we're there
I wanna take you there
You toot it up, I tear it down
You bring it back, I wear it out
Hit it like whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop
'Cause I ain't about to roll it if I ain't rollin' that fire
Yeah the sun is goin' down but I'm tryna take you higher
We both know this house could never be a home
But ain't you sick of spendin' all your nights alone?
If it's lovin' that you want, girl, I promise you desire
Soundwave, I feel we, put together
Some of the most beautiful music my nigga
Real talk, feels so good
Let's get this money
I feel like rapping tonight people
Can I rap a little?
Don't be mad..
Cuz I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward
Look, why I always feel that I'm hot?
Why I always feel I should drop another jewel
Like Martin on Blue Streak while you dudes get tattooed
With permanent scars, I'm always bullying y'all
I'm always righteous to think that life is what you make it
I'm always thinking of R&B bitches butt-naked
I'm always on point, like a snitch on the go
But I never snitch my car's the only thing I towed on
I'm always keeping it moving, middle finger up
Like I practice celibacy, I don't give a fuck
Just wait, I'm at they heads like a toupee yeah
It's like that, your cranium never survive titanium bars
Harder than my dick when the tip gets licked, quick
Run for cover like winter's here then listen here
K. Dot you'll never shake me loose
Like a tied knot off the goose, you mad at me too?
Yo, why you always critiquing my shit
Why don't you hop on your own dick like Marilyn Manson
I'm dancing with 2 brains, so if I got shot in the head
I won't die I'll just lose more game, propane walking
You could sell my words at an auction for the right price
And be rich your whole life, straight up
I wanna see the world by 35 but for right now I'm Compton bound
Hit Rosecrans with a pocket full of dividends
Big truck speed through the light, run over civilians
Pimp cut bitch on my right, hat low like a stripper ass
When she hit the floor, doing my thing, why you complain?
Cause I'm young and I'm black and I rap like a nigga got a
Angel on his back, wait a minute I means business
You homosexual with it, I give you straight lyrics
Now that's an emcee, that's why you mad at me?
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward (Fuck Ya!)
Check me out..
What I write is a like a bomb device, press play
And you can die tonight
Shook ones don't exist whenever that K. Dot spit
Off the chain like fast pedaling while riding a bike
I gets my ride on, you ride too
But like Scion, now that's a damn shame
I'm hogging up both lanes
Play your part, styles like Kevin Hart
They're so plain
I'm choking while I'm smoking on this strongest hocus pocus
Chocking with Punch
He sarcastic laughing cause I said that I can freestyle better than Kurupt
Now that's a statement that hopefully I can back up
See Kurupt is a legend, that's where I get my shit from
Straight lab rat, spit it once run it back
Like a punt return, they tell me wait my turn
So that's what I'mma do, lay in the cut like a 2 shot Dillinger
Killing these niggas in high pursuit waddup
I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cookin' up the flow
Gettin' my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top
Hub City beat
87 baby 87 Cudi screamin' out "Fuck the police"
Bubble kush in the trunk, choppers in the front seat
Get your top peeled back, don't chitterchat, don't speak of me
I move low-key, I think like a double OG
Inside of an old school bumpin' oldies
So high off life, that bitch I could OD
Die twice, and come back the same nigga
Lame niggas get up out of my lane nigga
Before the big rig come through and run over your brain nigga
Me propane niggas for their dividends
Forgive you innocent, Compton all of my uncles wore Pendletons
West Coast rider, bitch I'mma ride her
'Til the wheels fall off, buy more tires
Mmm, say hello to the new prince
I'm high king behind black tint
Na'mean?
I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cookin up the flow
Gettin' my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top
I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cookin up the flow
Gettin' my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top
Mmm, fuck 'em all, kill 'em all off
Send 'em off to the holy one
Put a hole in one, like miniature golf
Price on your head, and they trying to purchase
No matter the cost
Hand over the cloth
Cloth over the gun
Gun over your jaw
Bullet over your tongue
Stick my dick inside hip-hop and shorty's sprung
Every time I get a chance to come over I overcome
Over the snare drums
They say, "Who fucking with you if you the god MC?"
I tell 'em none
Get it? I tell 'em none
Catholic nor Christian, holding the book of sums
In the back of my True Religions
Never passed the bar but
I ain't got to study law
Just to judge lyrics
Mmm, I should be the judge of lyrics
Bang the gavel, give you a life sentence
I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cookin up the flow
Gettin' my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top
Reporting live, from Compton, California
North Cackalack
Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, no Audemar on my wrist
Its arthritis from holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy taking over, the world
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
Whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
To hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
With offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, who ya? No one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Cadillac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
Like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even Zeus can get beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the
City like a District Attorney beatin' the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
Since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
My God, my life is such turmoil
Can't save me tonight cause times is hard now
I know you tell me don't let my guard down
I gotta get it my nigga
Stare inside of the soul of Kendrick
While I stare inside the solar, system hopin' I soak up
Enough game to play 3 systems with one controller and remain sane and remain unsober
Was closer to my dreams but reality actually told me hold up
No money in my jeans and my salary said you owe us
Can't pay them taxes, laid on that matress and feel colder than a polar bear
But this bear was in California
So I felt out a pocket and then a piece of lint fell out my pocket
A broke opportunist all in my optics
And you could see it even when I'm Sleep
My screw's loose, I hate when loose change fall in them seats
Because I need every dime like Magic Johnson
Or Hugh Hefner living in his prime
Prime example of youngin' on his grind
This the life of a Compton nigga
I know the vanities of the world like the promise niggas
That's why we crooked, in yo bushes where you find us nigga
You better scramble before you fold like an omelet nigga
This ain't insomnic nigga and that means I don't need Busters to front on me
A Bible in my pocket I'm walkin' like it's a gun on me
So when I catch a fade they know to put more than one on me
Fear no evil, I can still see Regals pullin' up
Niggas tuck like a baby in fetal, position
If you listen you can hear the city needs you
That's what my mind said
But my big head is tellin' me that I'm a black Beatle
Until my number is called and someone yell bingo
A shadow in the dark, park the coupe
Then recoup with the homeless in the park, Kendrick Lamar
Murder
Gunfire, death is so quiet, ask why, tell ‘em it’s
Murder
The sun rise then hide by grey skies, that cry sounds like
Murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Shame on him! (what?)
Lemme put my gloves on
And my scrubs on
I'm the chemist that's whippin' it in the kitchen
This here is not for the children
You need parental advision
If you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business
First you bargain shop
Look for the priciest chickens
I recommend that you pay Jorge a visit
Got it wrapped in saran
17.5 no, drop four grand, this is LA man!
Unless it be a drought
But homie if it ain't, then it is somewhere else
Flip your hustle down south
That's a whole other story though
Back to the lesson, hope you're takin' down your footnotes, class is in session
Get your instruments
Grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
And a hanger you can stir it with
Split nine Os four ways in that 36
Place it on the triple beam
As hard as it may seem, it's not that tricky
Say you'll get it baby, just bear with me
Confidence before compliments
Now let's get busy
This is the procedure
250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda
Place it in the beaker
Your water should be boiling by then
Grab a small cup and pour it in
Twist the hanger until it's paper thin
Place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin
But hold on it gets tricky again!
As your hand rotate
You're probably thinkin' it's safe
Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace
The muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache
You're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith
Wait...you got it back soft (good)
Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar
The work should rise to the top
Then pour some cold water on that
That's when the dope should drop
Snatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet
Place it on the cardboard, then chop
As soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy
You're excited that the chemistry worked
This the fiend's appetite
This bigger than life
You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night
You should thank me twice
Though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life
How ironic...hmm
Like most of you rappers
There, there, baby
It's just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC, of growin' up
There, there, baby
It'S just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC, of growin' up
There, there, baby
It's just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC, of growin' up
There, there, baby
It's just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC, of growin' up
Living my life like I'm living right
In the midst of a fire pit, the gang-banging and violence
Is the sweetest song and I roam with the heart of a violin
Don't violate my patience I'm waiting, to kill a man
As I stare at the ceiling fan, as a fan of these wicked streets
If I gotta eat, I steal like a metal piece
I'm screamin' out fuck the police
I'm dealing my cards with Jokers on em
You can disown him or stone him
I'm throwing them rocks back, with the fury of bullets
You couldn't live your life for the moment
When I'm foamin' at the mouth
And my sharpest of teeth showin'
I'm in the back of a black Buick finna black out
Like February, ain't that's how Blacks do it, right?
I cut off my ears before I hear your advice and vice versa
I'm screaming for help, as loud as I can but that's not working
I'm working them corners like blueprints
Then caught an L on my first offense
The judge threw the book at me and said this
Ali, mix it
Ha ha ha, Lady G, Whaddup?
Ha ha ha, Bad Love, Whaddup?
Ha ha ha, ha...
I spaz out 'til I pass out
There’s clarity in my vulgarity for a sass-mouth
Your parody’s not funny
Apparently you ain't nothing but industry crash dummies
As long as the lord love me, I’m good
I could: be the best rapper but I’d rather be the answer that capture the violence that coincides in my hood
I should: stick a fork in this music business
But I’m too deep in it like pussy on my penis
Devil’s kitchen in Phoenix; that’s the heat that I’m bringing where the shade at?
I’m L.A. radio and good music, boy, I don’t play that
Ugh, Walking a thin line from thinking like Einstein
And rhyming like Rakim in ’89
Don’t wanna pack a nine just a mind full of wisdom
Like a man 99 years old locked in prison
Don’t freeload on my vision
Get exposed like an R&B ho with a sex tape hidden
I’m always for the business, forever you can feel it
Whether you Crip blue or a nigga that hemorrhage
My penmanship is like me and Langston combined to the hip
And my hip to the hop don’t stop as I rock
I got a buzz like a shot of Palmer Sun
And the women fall in love as they fall in my crotch
Now understand that I’m all that you’ve got
Give me chance, give me ears, give me hearts, give me props
Hear the difference? I’m cool like that
Oh, you spit? Well the retarded drool is back
See, I’m the author of the authors, the father of the Austin Power fajja
Who can bust like a charter, why bother?
I know a jealous serpent is a burden to my life
But still I carry on like luggage on a flight
The realness in my bones is the DNA to life
I can give you insight only if you’re in sight
I’m looking past y’all like a fastball - strike!
And I ain't even tryna give it my all - yikes!
I’m comfortable enough to go and chill out with a Huxtable
You couldn’t see my pedestal, because you’re afraid of heights
Cloud 9, where you can find
Me in my dime like Roosevelt in his prime
Wait 'til I’m in my prime
The moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion
To whom say he cool: but the irony is I could hold the bottom of an iron with the bottom of my palm
I say so much, so little all action, no talk like a mime throwing up gang signs
It’s not all about punchlines, I don’t do that
I’m a Jaguar; you’re just a new cat, now move back
Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success
Aiming for the top like an AR aimed at your neck
I can never digress, ‘less I get demoted to death
Even then I’ll be the best still, like a petty theft
I will: conquer my biggest dreams
Once you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings
Nipsy got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred
And all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head
But still they’ll feel me, cause we all ate cereal
Humped our momma's friend's daughter while they bump the stereo
Backflips on shopping carts, free lunch at the park
Watched Power Rangers after school; here we go
I’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise
For no faulty ass A&R or CEO
We ain't what you think and you think we’re back
But we’ve been here for decades, and I vouch for that
Open your mouth for that, speak well like a great debater over iChat
Get your other eye cracked
I don’t rap, I-Iraq and declare war
I enjoy watching enemies' blood pour
I came up lower middle class, not poor
So don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me
I need y’all to feel me
And if you feeling froggy to leap, then feel free
My feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived
By the ultimate prize I'mma get when I see your suicide
I am a sinner who’s probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don’t know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that’s amazing
To you that’s a quick check with all disrespect let me say this
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'mma break out and then hide every lock
I'mma break out and then hide every lock
I am a human who’s probably gonna fault again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don’t understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I’m yelling
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Pulling up and hopping out
Shell, catch it poppin' out
And I ain't never been a Tom or a Jerry
Pussy or a Rat, pussy on my nutsack
Carry plenty Kenny tats, give me that, give me plenty fetti
Federales on my back, pack them in the cemetery
Send a scary hit out on your messenger
I'm ignorant to wrestle a gorilla in the center of an Acura Integra
I'm pissed off, so I piss off rooftops
Drinking through a straw, fuck a rent-a-cop
I'm hot, I'm napalm when the beat slap like eight palms
And I wear eight charms, every airport alarm
Go off till they tackle me, what I do wrong?
Nigga it ain't 'bout the chain, nigga you the fucking bomb
Bomb on a bitch nigga then his bitch later
Put the tips on the bitch, nigga you a fucking waiter
I don't even want a favor, I just want a fair one
And it's like that till the sheriffs come
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Jumping off the front porch with a new approach
Don't approach me with the bullshit
I remote to a location where the broom sit
Here I go street sweeper Monday through Friday
If not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
Where you from Droop-E? (The West)
Where you from Kendrick? (The West)
Aye 40 where you from though? (The West)
Who bring it to their front door? (The West)
And where they get their game from? (The West)
And where they get their slang from? (The West)
And where they get their strains from? (The West)
And where they get their grapes from? (The West)
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
It's a secret garden in my mind
Flower child
When the lights get low and you notice I am the sun
The winter time was snow but only little you know
I will still breathe, give me the keys
I'm resuscitating the game, see me in CPR
My name is a gun cocked, gun shot
Dead and I won't stop
Gun cocked, gun shot
Head in a pine box
With a dozen roses, hold this with a gift card
Gun cocked, gun shot
Flowers on your momma's yard
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
It's a secret garden in my mind
Flower child

I'm a pirate on a dock full of dope
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You cannot test no key in the Tesla
Bitch I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras
It's alive
Alls my life I has to fight, hittas
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, "Yeah!"
Bad trips like, "Yeah!"
Nazareth, I'm on one
Homie you on one
But if God got us
Then we gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty uh, uh is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Everything I sow, so my karma come
And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say?
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Hitta, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Hitta, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo' sho'
Hitta, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
What you want, you a house, you a car?
A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Look, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every little zero
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
I right my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Hitta, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Hitta, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo' sho'
Hitta, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Get back
Look I started from the bottom, at the very bottom
Mixin' Hen with similac my momma knew I had a problem
I was jibbing for a bottom, putting quarter pieces in the black caprice and make it holla (Alright)
No releasing me, I got the piece in me, I gotta
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
Inner-city bullet fly 'til that thing on auto pilot (Alright)
I don't really care about the care abouts
All I care about is wearing out your upper body
When I catch ya, when I catch ya, walking out your parents house
(Alright)
Fourteen years old sound so raw making plays home boy
Big K's and my big dogs
Never, ever, went straight home, boy
(Alright)
I used to dream of risin' now I see it clearer
How surprising, I'm admiring that mirror
I'm inspiring the finer things in life
And your time is slowly expiring, you're crying me a river
That's ironic because she have a river as well
I like to swim in it like Olympians, Y-S-L
And some Timberlands, high as hell
A ceilin' is an understatement, I burn through it, prove it's a fire drill
Fire hoes, bad bitches fire hoes
Fire then re-hire hoes
Her entire crew is tired of the liars that you runnin by her
I can see you, hoe
Plenty priors of a fuck nigga, nigga, I suppose
I can fly her, put her in attire of designer clothes
Dayton wires on the Chevy, why are you not tolerable?
Don't you know they already fuck me, I'm a made man
Maids in the mansion, clean 'em up out here
Pour up another shot of Hennessy, my tendency to start the party with
Probably hit that Bob Marley, I ain't with that Molly shit
Represent my nigga, bang your hood
Bloods and Crips in the same building, it's all good
I'm looking at this pretty fine thing rolling with her friend
Hoping I can make her mind change, jump inside my Benz
Let me get it cracking
Conversation turn to plenty sexual frustration
Fuck-faces looking at her, hard to not be impatient
Oh, really though?
You drink? You smoke?
Get a case, get a 1/8, fly high not coach
G5, sit back I'll drive, let me know
On the couch, on the bed, on the floor, say go
Say when, in the wind, we go
We toast to the game, no games, we both really grown
I'm saying, you playing, I mean, I dance
To my own beat, to the beat now flip your hands and
Let the smoke burn, let the smoke burn in your vein
When it's your turn hit it twice then say my name
Say my name, say my name, I appear like Candyman
Dark chocolate, vanilla, I tell you this is Candy Land
This is Candid Camera, there's no pauses allowed
They don't understand us because we won't turn it down
Middle fingers in the air, this is truth and double dare
300 drunk muthafuckas in the holding cell
These streets is jurassic, cowards get asthmatic
Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere, that the ghetto burb
Pull up on the curb (what's up homie!), smoke a nigga then dip
It's the immaculate, verbal assassin, strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
This is Jesus of Nazareth
Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown
In a cherry Low-Low with four zones of weed, no sticks no seeds
Prestigious when I post safe through fifty states, beneath the speed
Can corral the largest crowds, mosh pit with a big dick
Screaming bitches ain't shit, she gobble gobble for hours I jumped in the shower
I dismantle, devour, hardest Emcees softer than Clam chowder
No challengers can compete, they're childish and weak, detrimental
Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein
I'm kurupted!
I'm kurupted!
Gimme a hundred G's for every Emcee I drop to their knees
Verbically useless, oh you got the Juice? I'll squeeze you juiceless
Catch you, hang you from many nooses
Been the truth since, Snoop and the pound was fuckin' over ruthless
Young and I'm ruthless, twenty-one with twenty-one guns, shottys thats looted from Pac, lyrical cyclops
Lazer-in 'em on paper and fraudulent friends, bitch you's a bitch in disguise and bitches get ten
Bullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal injection in a regal higher than church steeples, I swear to god
Count your lyrics in a jar, I'mma pterodactyl tearin' ya squad, like pardon me in Terrance Martin in Aston Martin
Cannibal co-existing with the coldest, that means I'm the sickest, and Theraflu won't do
Whenever I'm kicking the wickedness, explosive, syntagmatic, smokin' like the barrel of this tech aimin' at ya' neck
I'm kurupted!
I'm kurupted!
(Look homie) I'm from C-O-MP-TO-aNy nigga can get it, the little homie strapped and he with it
At the Avalanche swap-meet (what's up fool!)
Blunt longer than Rosecrans, I'll grab the devil then slow dance
Practice trigonometry, practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches, you are counterfeit
Worthless beats and verses surfaced. West Coast with a big scope kill all Y'all It's Top Dawg, TDE, CPT
Quick to tell a bitch jump on my dick A.S.A.P
Complete havoc, compulsive disorder, rhyme addict -- Slaughter
House is full of Joey, Joells and Royces for ya'
Live from the area code of Three-One-Oh
Laughin' all the way to the bank with three Elmos
Three six-fo's, One bottle of Goose, I'm the truth, you could put your hand on the bible and shoot
I'm Kurupted!
See a lot of y'all get real disrespectful, real comfortable, not recognizin' ya' legends
West Coast legends, Young Gotti
I black out like Howard University when I verbally turn into Hercules hurtin' these Emcees early and urgently urkin' my nerves searching for certain certified nouns and verbs on the verge of vigorous victory. Kurupted
See you in the mornin'
Take off, nigga, I'm time zonin'—tell 'em I'm sky high
Going, going, goin'
Up there, nigga, I'm time zonin'—tell 'em I'm sky high

Nigga, I'm sky high

Nigga, I'm sky high
See you in the mornin'
Going, going, goin'
My turbo boostin', my jetpack cruisin'
Get jet lag when I come back to these fuckin' humans
I could put planet Earth in a canister
Then continue my crater search, with Captain Kirk
Look at my verse, you seein' signs?
You hearin' signals deciphered from District 9
No fuckin' rapper-cypher when meteors flyin'
The meters are flyin' but I'm way faster
Run away bet I catch ya, fire like striking matches
I'm higher with martians laughin' in spaceships as stars is crashin'
Hover above the masses, a massive attack we're mixin'
Kendrick Lamar with magic, pull rabbits from hats—
Niggas—wanna hop on track—bitches—wanna hop on dick—
"Damn! Is that a fuckin' blimp?! No, O-M-G, that's him!"
A shootin' star hangin' over a new eclipse
Hangin' over a big dip, when my music flip, nigga, I'm sky high
Shit
See you in the mornin'
Take off, nigga, I'm time zonin'—tell 'em I'm sky high
Going, going, goin'
Up there, nigga, I'm time zonin'—tell 'em I'm sky high
I'm sky high
Nigga, I'm sky high
See you in the mornin'
Going, going, goin'
Everyday I try to escape the realities of this world
So I tell a disc jockey “press play” while I press up on a girl
In the midst of the smoke in the air
The reflection of lights that glare
She’ll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight I might have to stare
And that’s power steering, a power trip will see my appearance
Pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in the darkest dungeon
Speakers bumpin’, drinks is pouring
We in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus
That’s real big, pop my collar, pop that lid
Come to my section (my section)
And down some of this liquor
Then tell me what it hit for
Gon' be some things I don’t remember
So take some camera phone pictures
(Los Angeles Leakers)
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
Where the fuck did y'all get this record from, homie?
Uh huh, Kendrick Lamar (Sail)
I look in the mirror and nothing's familiar I stare
I look in the mirror and nothing's familiar I dare
For you to say that you're familiar with character which this I have
Mental is riding a big yellow cab
Telling the driver to press on the gas
Yell at them until I get there
You could just love me and leave me alone
I'm warning you though if you love me you never go wrong
We can explore heavy feelings of breathing mother nature's air
Feelings of knowing I'm rather rare
But there's a reason for all of my madness the gladness I am that you're here
Annie, are you okay? Ooh, yeah (ooh, la-la)
Annie, are you okay? Ooh, yeah
Do you like foreplay? Ooh, yeah
Do you go both ways? I really need confirmation
Your love is abomination, fucking you is like a bomb of nations
Area 51 in that pussy, ah
The president 'bout to cum in that pussy, ah
I got mind control, I got dick control
I reel 'em in for the fishing pole
I love legs like Robyn Fenty
Stretch them shits like limo Bentleys
Catch them tits with an open mouth
The interview up outta that Oprah house
You know I love it when it's pokin' out
You know I'm thuggin' even in the drought, you know him
I fuck around and crash a brand new Bugatti
In the mothafuckin' lobby so you know I'm in it better
Won't you kiss it, baby? Take a picture
I, I, I, I, I'm killin' em
Illuminati want my money and my body
Even Donny rollin' by me, looking aggravated that I made it
Fuck you and your mama, nigga
I, I, I, I, I see the bitch in them, I got the Benjamin
I got the dividend, I'm on my toes like Serena at the Wimbledon
Pie à la mode on a Monday for my woman-friend
I'm in the mode of a mortal man
I'm living in the orbit of deliverin'
Sex in a cathedral, empty, Grand Marnier that I reload, ten Gs
In the hallway, she a Leo, I'm a Gemini
Give me mine, genocide, kill 'em all, thirty times
Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
I’m a thinker not a drinker but still I hennessy drag
Alcohol numbs the pain like with novacane stabs
In your arteries pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on em
Colors corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted crip & piru’s cripple the city
Triple the crime, Bible nor the Qur’an can save
Welcome don’t be afraid, your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
Stare at the sky wonder will you live to see 25?
I’m 22 at 20 I knew I was against the odds
This kid named Jonathan was monitorin’
His momma & sister, his older cousin he honoured him
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishin’
To Johnny he might have been a modern day rider then
He walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a mac 11, now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem, what’s his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that he’s from and thats one
More gangster under the family tree, took em under his wings like KFC
Crip crazy, rocking matching t-shirts that says “the hood made me”
No love just spread slugs thats the policy, the leader and the prodigy
Now shorty do-wap, holdin a ou-wap, hanging with rah rah’s with blah blah’s
That sit on the block catching fades, hitting licks, going on missions with lunatics
A 9th grade menace thugging for 6 months, smoking like 6 blunts
An hour the power of banging, he was walking… *3 Gun Shots*
Little Johnny
His eyes bloodshot red
I watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brother
Reminiscin' on them playing Sega with each other
He was hurtin', I could see it, plenty tears, no Kleenex
I stood by his side because that was my homie
Gave him a hug, some of his brother's blood got on me
Clinchin' his fist on some angry shit
Stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hangin' with
I wasn't sure, so I gave him no answer
But I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
Revenge, what do you say to a good friend
That just lost it and grabbin' choppers out of the closet?
I tried my best to make him re-neg
But he was like, "My nig, this feelin' is more than personal"
I stood down
He hopped in a four-door Honda Accord
Before he bent the block, he said, "K-Dot...
"...You wouldn't understand"
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
Or, at least, try to understand
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)
Corners become monuments for the dead
Candles on the pavement, postcard read
Rest in peace, the yellow tape blockin' off the streets
A baby mama yellin' at the police
But you don't understand
You figure that we're just a bunch of niggas but the picture here's a story untold
See, this wasn't in our plans
Babies from the late '80s wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way
Put that Malcom X book down, then raise that K
Complete chaos when we off X pills and St. Ides
Look the devil in the face, from a sane eye
Cast the spell on you like Akeelah and the Bee
Every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted mind
Substance, time, is no longer an issue
We don't have it, so pass the tissue
Then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can
And tell her you understand, but you don't understand
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
And, hopefully, you'll understand
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)
He came back fifteen minutes later
He said, "Dot, I went on one, do me this favor
Dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you
This as critical as it gets, my nigga, I need you"
I said, "Alright, so what happened?"
"Seen a few niggas slippin' and I just started clappin'
I didn't care who I was hittin'"
That's wild shit, but anyway, I got you
I love you nigga make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
I woke up the next mornin' with a cold
Allergies got me sneezin' and wipin' my nose when it was leaking
Checked the medicine cabinet, lookin' for some DayQuil
But all I seen was some Aspirin, s'just my luck
I got up, went to Rite-Aid
Hopin' that the pharmacy department had the right aid
I bought it and left
Walked to the parking lot, that's when I seen the faces of death
Said they was lookin' for my man, with a chopper in they hand
Prayin' it would jam, but you don't understand
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
I'm tellin' you, do you understand?
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s)
Huh? Do you understand?
(The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)
It's like
It's a revolving door
That I've been a part of
My whole life
Fucked up, right?
Love is life and life is love, I like to love
Every part of you, the party life can never do enough
So many obstacles the possibilities are breaking up
Can move in hospital with that extra patient you got me stuck
I'll play the prostitute if you've got the patience to pimp me
But you never put me on the strip, put it on then you strip
Put it on your fingertips and I'll kiss it off
You better not kiss me goodbye, Test my faith and kiss the cross
I'm trying to go there, take you slow there if it's alright
Tell me that you care, baby, we could share a full life
Truth and double dare that I do repair broken hearts
Cupid shot me in the dark, stupid I didn't play my part
Ask for your forgiveness, if it's worth it I can serve a purpose
If I'm st.. st.. stuttering because I'm nervous
Tell me that you love me still, promise that I'm staying still
Honesty is all I need, honestly, we can build
Coming straight from Compton, I thought y'all know
I ain't gonna look at the cards yet, cause I'm 'bout to flow
Matter fact, this the perfect part to talk about them Lakers
Everybody that's disrespecting, y'all the fakers
We gonna keep going, off the top of the dome
Mavs, y'all gonna go home
Teach y'all to come back to my city
Shrink you, G
Five times, four times, that's the repeat
Obama, we ain't gonna talk about Ritt Momney
Because he's whack, fugazi, fugazi
I don't need to talk about the flow that I'm in
If you gonna vote, vote for Obama
He's gonna win, fo sho
And we gonna keep on going
Off the top, we just gonna keep on flowing
We gonna get back to this little punk, he's crap
Mitt Romney, show 'em how to rap
Matter fact, this freestyle is just dedicated to him
You're homeboys right now with Slim
Your chances, you're not gonna win
You need to go back to where you came from, boy
It's the ruler of the game
Obama, vote now homeboy, he's got change
What's up
I said we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
My flow China white
Like a sheep in the snow
I go deep as the Bible, I could debate with the pope
And you rappers go down hill
Like a ski on the slope
I been a boat with Papi
But I ain't trying to cop no work
I'm trying to cop me the boat and some more property
I told Rock
"We gotta be more then just a commodity
Make the whole name and entity to infinity"
Y'all want me off the juice, no grenadine
Could stop me from thinking presidential like the scattered brains of Kennedy
After I shot, duck down
So the crowd won't witness me
Now, could somebody locate Mr. Shakur?
And tell these Tupacs, they two shots, away from two blocks
Of being neighbors with the Almighty Lord
I put your best material in, then fast forward
Kendrick, signing off
I'm sure your signature's forged, boy
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we...
Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, I'm tryna get blown
I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac Brougham
Looking for E.T. to phone home
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains
Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons
Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
That's fashion if you come where I'm from
Compton California, One love to the murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
But I don't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
And so I scooped him round 3:30, Telling me it's all good
Tiger Woods, Now we looking for the birdy birdies
Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
Pulled up on the breezies, Well what do you know? I think they love us
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
And if you feel good (hey)
Raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey)
Represent the city like you know you should (hey)
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
As I continue my day, quite copacetic
Headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell
Had the right grub, I bail, need some gas
ARCO station on Avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past
We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited we got 'em
Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites
I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions
But anyway I'm steady coasting, smoking on that Hiroshima
Ashtray got a million roaches, I'm focussed but feeling good
The homies hanging on {?} and Monte Carlos
Impalas and Tahoes, shoot something nigga, break that fifty
I'm grabbing the city like I'm supposed to
Making my presence felt like Christmas day, what can I say?
Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G
If you can't relate then please have a seat
So, wherever you located, won't you let it be known
And put on for the soil of which you was grown
I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors
While giving you cuts like fresh tapers
I'm such a fool with it, go nuts
You bullshitting like Tuck, the bounce then untuck
The bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck
Take 'em to school I must, this for the cool in us
This ain't for you, so what?!
My fault nigga, I actually came up with the idea to write that
(You laughin' but that shit ain't funny man)
It was funny at first but
"Boarding completed I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
Relax and breathe normally"
Uh, coming down like I'm uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
Then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
Ha-ha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause I'm a trip
Landing on another runway, fly with me
Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on
Like we never been off, straight shots of Patron
I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is, hey lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?
Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage (Lil Mama)
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't, I gotta beat that nigga
Curtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause I'm a trip
Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
On some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan
I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming
So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause I'm a trip
"How was your flight Mr. Lamar?
Good, hope to see you next time"
You never knew a plug, plug, plug, a plug like this
Sophisticated gangsta, watch me thug like this
Snatch your, uh, in a club like this
Seven zeros, need my pub like this
Stuck in a rock in a hard place
I am thinkin' I won't bump y'all up, well, I am
I got to get my thing off
My style come from Devin the Dude, Kurupt, 2
And James Brown with his fist crossed
I fluctuate the vocals like Prince Rogers
Whoever thought a billionaire come out of Compton?
Multiply simple logic, it's rules you can follow
If Dre ain't motivation, I don't know who is
Gift and a curse, maybe them shoes is too big
Or maybe I'm too pessimistic to know I'm gifted
Chasin' hood rat brownie points and bullshittin'
I dropped the four on 'em, scrapin', hopped a four on 'em
Grab my dick and pour on 'em
Yeah, homie, I'm still talkin' that whoop-de-whoop
Hoppin' out on my enemies, I know who to shoot
Back when my homies where I need to be
Such a familiar sceneries, I smell the gun smoke
I watched a homie watch his son smoke
I seen the sun set on my set
I seen one 'Ru and one Loc, one slip and one played him close
Everythin' subject to change
Nowadays, the Compton Crip car kill each other
Faster than an opposite color
Homies whack out everythin', you're dead, homie
It's your mother, your uncle and brother
If God was a Loc, he'd probably had one comin'
Damn, that's fucked up, I guess it is
When you can't trust not a soul inside these streets
I made a video out there in Copenhagen, so the homies can see
To let 'em know it's more than just Pamela Lee
They said, "Good looking"
Paused the video the moment his phone ring
That fast dollar was his only problem
No matter how many times I showed him the Eiffel Tower
The block was home and Africa was too far for power
Then I knew
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't stop
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap
We don't share the same synonyms, fall back
Been in it before Internet had new hacks
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visitin' freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can visit a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master and mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction, runnin' pure magic
Thank God for rap, I will say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that? I know everything
I know everything, I know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit, that isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's hungry
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
You know, they know that from Compton School District
I give it to the kids, don’t gossip ‘bout how it was distributed
I, I, I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit
Big Boy, what’s up?
I don’t give a butt about no politics in rap
My little homie Stunna Deuce ain’t never comin' back
So I got to go hard every time I jump on wax
Bump what they talking ‘bout, this here is where it’s at
Look, I came in this game, I stuck my fangs in this game
I wore no chain in this game, my hood, my name in this game
Now I double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
I’m stickin' to the scripts like, “Yeah, 'em Benjamins can cuddle up”
I skip, hop, I drip-drop, I flip-flop with them white tube socks
It go sherm sticks, watch me burn this
That’s what the chronic smell like when them chemicals mix
Fifty-homie salute, I’m out to Compton Zoo with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans that eff with me
Nobody can eff with me, tell y'all to eff with me
Jumpin' out the Caddy, uh, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called
They said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Homie’s name on paper, you snitched all summer
The streets don’t fail me now, they want to put the game in town
From Compton to Congress, it’s set trippin’ all around
Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Tell me they profit to fuck with you
Nobody can fuck with you, Obama said, "What it do?"
Can I get one more?
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’
Motherfuck if they did, then a nigga'd be platinum
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no politician at award shows
No, don’t ask about my, hoes, no, don’t ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, buyin' land stock
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo
All these things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the...
And they all wanna feed my ego
When they wanna lay up in the front seat do'
With the feet up, 'Beep Beep' in the Regal
Baby hurry up, 'Skeet Skeet' she go deep throat
Then I'm rolling in the wind, Chi Town
Top down in the summer time, brand new number 9's
I be lovin' that crap like it's Cee-Lo
They be lovin' my crack man I'm Nino
She know that I see more C notes than you
Give me Chemo, home sick and I need help
But I hardly medicate myself, I doctor everything that I do
I've been the one, since I was one
This game I got, it weighs a ton
These bitches go, these bitches come
She scream some more every time she cum
Orgasms and a lot of Champagne
Back spasms and diamond rings
Diamond cut, nigga it's no cut
When I yell "HiiiPower, TDE Gang"
I'm ridin' round, I'm ridin' round
The corner from success, and I made a left
Then I got it right, now fuck your life bitch Kendrick's next
I'm talkin' dick in the whole world
Your Ex and your new girl
Shit you nothin' new girl
There's better bitches than you girl
As I ride around, I'm right around the corner from success
Then I made a left and got it right
Now fuck your life, my dick is wet. Pause
Hold up man this my song, let me take it back real quick for ya'll
Ridin' roun' town, mo' change, mo' steelo
New girl with me, but I keep it on the d'lo
All these things goin' down, what you think she with me for?
Look like she from Rio, sweeter than Tampico
Greetings people
You're now rockin' with the best
Hub City's threat
Minor of the year
K.Dot
I know the hood's been waitin', right
I'mma stop being stingy
I'mma share with y'all
Whoever thought young Kendrick would spit so ignorant
Make street disciples go and get a membership
Streets revival like Creflo Dollar hustlin' on the strip
This is church
Advise you to purchase it or copy the worst
Y'all rhymes sloppy, I rhyme properly
I jam pack Monopoly dollars by puttin' 100% in every verse
Add 10% more and what do you get
A skinny nigga manipulatin' the innocent
I have no sense, ever since the Rodney King riots
Mind militant, nigga don't try it
Try to hold the peace, for I promote violence
Y'all don't rap
Y'all make a lotta noise like sirens
So I'm here to shut shit down
The four pound decorate your city
Make over your town
I'm not Diddy, but still a bad boy
'Til the reaper come get me, follow me now
Where no man has stepped, no man has repped
No man can withstand all the nights I've slept
Under my sheets, no life, thinkin' 'bout death
Fuckin' with me, you just might lose your breath
I'll take you to them pearly gates
Them golden streets
Plus a cute little casket so your body can sleep
The Hub City shit is me
Do you believe
It's Kendrick the God
Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
As soon as the beat drop
Within two bars, you already said I'm hot
They savor, my fruits of labor
My flow is sweeter than strawberries, oranges, and apricots
God-dammit I raised the standards of the status-quo
To go against me you gotta be more than professional
You got to go extra hard like an erection with no protection
And I be fucking all these bars
We be sexing I'm a nympho
For the instrumentals, all right, I admit it
Matter of fact I got a hot date tonight, real rap
Take this and take that from the machine
Got this money up, with no caffeine
Prepare me is Kerosene struck by a bunch of lightening
You looking at me then your sight seeing
And what that means is that this human being is fly, don't try to duplicate
I'm authentic, I see you scoping my style like forensics, that is foul
Tech! Leave 'em by the benches
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
I see the future better than your computers
Apple software got the next 10 years scared I'm Fred Krueger
Rugers on my hip, terminate all intruders
Leave them dead inside the sewers
Shoulda' coulda' knew I was a murderer
Burning up the very sun, the rapture
The god is back, they said he'd come, but I came faster
I'm not an actor, if you play Denzel, you'll be thrown through a windshield
The nine merely is handheld, the AK is hands on
Now the battlefield I can land on one thousand mines and don't blow up because I'm the bomb
Inside your CD deck, duck for cover, guard your neck, I demand respect
If I never see a check, at least I got these rap niggas in check
Preach Tabernacle fetch the holy bible if I'm lying
King of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my vision tunnel
Because I don't need to get sidetracked, my producer name is Soundwave and he gives me beats by the batch
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
...Snatch your bitch if she got a great appetite
For the top dog catalog, that means everybody
Several bodies on the shoty don't make it eight rappers
Damn I hate rappers, don't call me that
If you called it how you seen it you would call me real rap
I don't fabricate shit, all I do is keep it real
Eat, sleep, and take shits wipe me down if you will
Hold up, big truck, lurkin' with the monster grill
Four fifteens I got beat like Emmett Till
Put me in my g-mode schooling every hot-head
Tell them about the g-code, like eskimos
My arms froze, popsicle
Observing the game, I'm so official
I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em
"Stay strong, keep your faith in God," what I told him
Hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
As the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old
Your brother's getting older
And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
Ain't recieved any mail
It's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine
Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
After he just got out, 15 years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long
Haven't seen a girl in so long
And before the sun came up, he was gone
Like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or what not
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his Mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
Two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life
I can only imagine
That's fucked up
I can only imagine, Uncle Bob
Sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio
Of blacks in prison as compact in prison
When blacks pack with minorities
System grab more of these 18 year olds
18 year sentence with no parole
The state won't oversee
They make the term severe, a conspiracy?
That's what I call it, it's full of shit
A toilet can help quick, the government help?
No, just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there, yeah
It's justice for all but 90 percent unfair
Care? No
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man
For 5 grand, with intentions to expand
More prisons
So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business
Imagine
We're being used
Imagine
The truth shall be told
Welcome to the C4
I got the bombs and the rental
Meet me on Central, and Rosecrans
Goddamn, I'm the man, for life
The left coast, bitch get it right
Welcome to the C4, got the bombs and the rental
Moving through the block like a centipede
No rooftop, who hot? I'mma show them where the antifreeze
I hit the dealership, and tell them hand me keys, like a grand pianist
Damage anything said, then landing on top of your bitch, oops I tripped
I'm clumsy like Michelle Williams, or Jaleel White
I feel like a Predator, and none of you Danny Glovers are ready for, Alien tactics
The god is back, they're on their knees praying like a mantis
As I perform like Santa Clause
Pause TVs in the Phantom
Bitches on my left and my right like I pant them
Dancing on the coast, emerging from the smoke
Pimping in my blood, tell doc to check my pulse
They knew that was K.Dot the gemini, with another cut like a Samurai
Anything else is uncivilized
Fucker
I'm looking at the flashy lights and wonder - the price and number
Enticed by the glamorous ice, I wanna
Unite with the Hollywood twice, my concert'll look like yours
And I wanted more than I could ever imagine, even a kicked-down door
So you can hear that I'm rapping, see, I can hear "encore"
Struck by the fame bug, been fighting the same drug
The feeling that caned us in vain, it's tough love
Tough love - please help me, please help me
I'm on my knees, please help me, need you to tell me
Ain't nothing bigger than you, I thought a Benz would do
But nothing bigger than you, ain't nothing bigger than truth
Truth be told, they tolled and polled
Of non-believers just made the cattle blow
But I can see ya, even when my vision's impaired
Many moons away, but still you're right here
My people don't love me
Why we hate each other?
Why we kill our brothers, why we hurt our mothers?
My people don't love me
We can love one another
We should stick together because we're all we got
My people don't love me
Why we ride on another, need to love one another
We all we got
My people don't love me
I said we all we got, I swear to God dog we all we got
My people don't love me
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we
Can't be a positive black role model
Leading the future with no haters to follow
Now that's fucked up, if I ever wanna see
Success, I gotta see death? Be famous for what?
He aiming for higher learning, you aiming to shoot him down
He flying straight, you wanna u-turn him
You burn your brother's bridges
His accomplishments making way for your children
Still you don't compliment, inconsiderate black pride
No never been, never win, gotta lose
That's the slope that's for the black heritage
We play the fool better than comedians
Disobediant dude no respect, ethics
I refuse to be a statistic
But changing my community don't seem realistic
Show me an African American doing right
I'll show you one that will kill his ass tonight
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we
And there ain’t nobody loving me, down
The way you make me go places I forbid
And the spaces I should have known
And there ain’t nobody breaking me down
The way you make me go places I forbid
And the spaces I should have known
In the late week, I was in London
I really wanna get into something
Bus way too cold (way too cold)
And I don’t wanna feel that numbness
And I just had a show, and I wanted you to go
But you had one too, I was wondering
Are the time gods on my side?
If so, God, press that button
Stuck on a tall-ass bus
Like 14 bunks and I can’t even sleep
And I hate getting drunk so I don’t got a cup
But I’ve got James Mason on repeat
I’m tryna stay on that good thing
You know?
Whatever song Heaven would sing
You know?
Broken up Alphabets
How can I get this convo to stay comprehensive
When the service is never working
And the Wi-Fi is out commission
And I’m not short with you on purpose
I’m a man of just few words
If you like to chat, then in fact
My job is to make sure you’re heard
Ms. Chatty — I’m like one message from calling a taxi
Exactly, I’ll catch a cold but as long as you match me
It’s actually a troublesome world when you think about it
So admit it, we both could look good with it if you’re the stylist
Hold up…
Digga-da digga-da digga-da da
Digga digga digga da digga da da
You stay in that dank lounge, I'mma sit an decide
And P.S., the Olive Oils always love the Popeyes, I guess
I guess…
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
And opened my eyes
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
But my love was blind
You was caring, you was sharing, you was thoughtful, you was sweet
You was upliftin', you was different, you was commited, you was me
You was supportive, you was honest, easy going
You had promise, that you'd never break a promise
You was life, you was free, from the bull shit
... I think
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
And opened my eyes
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
But my love was blind
You was insecure, jealous hearted, slight retarded
I was nauseous, I was marching back and forth, and you was forcin' me to forfeit
Female fraudulent, you female doggin' it
It's like extortion on my heart and shit
I probably fell for it, cause you was gorgeous
Now your course, done ran it's courses, and of course you know I'm exhausted
Time you know I surely lost it
Should of been wiser, should of been cautious
Should of been tighter with my game
I chose a dame that chose to entertain drama and what remains
Is hate, so fuck your fucking name
You fake and live in a hall of shame
Materialistic, egotistic, thirsty bitches
Open house, and mouth for niggas to stick they dick in
Thought you was different, but you wasn't
Take that back, I wish I would of just fucked with your cousin
Ass was fat, but never mind that
We out here fussin', fightin'
Ask your friends to give advice, but they just like you
Clashing like some titans, could have broadcasted on pay-per-view
Promise that you never break a promise, should I trust you?
Now you only go for condoms, on late nights just because you, with the bull shit
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
And opened my eyes
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
But my love was blind
Wake up
I know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
If I can't lay up in the streets I feel lonely
If I gotta break up with the streets I feel lonely
Wake up
I know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
If I can't lay up in the streets I feel lonely
If I gotta break up with the streets I feel lonely
Justify the love of mine
For life of crime, my life and times
Is hard at times
I fall a time, like all the time
And then I dream for baller time
And then the clock rewind, and I
Wake up
I know homie
I know homie
Wake up
I know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
If I can't lay up in the streets I feel lonely
If I gotta break up with the streets I feel lonely
Justify the love of mine
For life of crime, my life and times
Is hard at times
I fall a time, like all the time
And then I dream for baller time
And then the clock rewind, and I
Wake up
I know homie
I know homie
Kendrick Lamar the modern day Malcolm
Humble and modest but these margins can move a mountain
I moshpit on the beat and leave the mark of a thousand marksmen
Clearing the street and killing rappers with talent, preach
Yes I said talent, Kendrick ain't scared of y'all, can’t even spell competitor
Lord is my witness
I remember asking artists in streets how they did it
The only features I got is was this handsome face I was getting
How ironic, playing Sonic was the shit like a colonic
Now we vomit over these beats while critics pay homage
This is too street like my 23 summers in Compton
I go so deep, like my dick in your bitch hope the condom never do leak
2 seats, one car, all you hear yes daddy and snapped bras
High salary blow jobs, high calorie rap bars not me
My sweet 16 probably need a school ID
And usually I be, the dominant victor
You know what time it is nigga
Affirmative Action, you fact or you fiction?
I’m a slain cracker from being insane
Pop a vein when I write this shit
I’m think on the shit, I'm vain and I think you’re a bitch
A female poodle under some homo's voodoo, sucking the industry's dick
We catching bodies, fades in the hotel lobby, fuck your security
And that's at the Ritz-Carlton
My impurity's probably your best asset
I spit acid, hit your block and crumble your address
Leaving them stagnant
This is torture when I tort-ya, or escort you
Out the building where ex-convicts with all sorts of
Permeant handshakes, your man can’t stick to the script with handpaint
Popping your lip then popping the clip then popping your van, wait
We keep the piece, but want the peace
Said I was Malcolm to your belief whats up
(Beat 3: Kurupt - I'm Burnt)
Feeling like a motherfucking animal
Hannibal Lechter of 2012
Elected to execute every rapper that has excelled
If music your calling
Then you balling, pick up yourself
If a nigga said he could see me
Bet he told you in Braille, fucker
Put you on front street, then buy some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, should've worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldn't bare my triumph
I'm a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Swinging swords like I'm sparring with a Spartan
Watch they face drop when the beat drop
I drop a real jewel like a Martin, fool
Me and curtains ballin' like peewee kirkland callin' 'em kirk franklin
Stomp 'em, leave 'em hurting
No judgement for a plaintiff
They tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as O.D.B
But I've been O.D. since '03
That's March 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it's like sweet chin music on Chuck Norris
Cardo got wings
Been ready
Jay, I been ready
HOV, I been ready
They say patience
Everybody wanna know why my game plan so strong
Cuz' I ain't gotta think with a light bulb on
Nigga I eat, sleep, and shit rap; I never relax, been a busybody since I was born
"Is he really fucking with Sean?"
I reply, "His pick, I would take a tool on."
Dolce brown nigga, I'm right now, you ain't gotta wait later
Where the CD at? Put it in the disc player
Tell ho ride to it, I do it like none other
K-Dot, definition of a young motherfucker with a problem
"Future of the West Coast" I am
And that's real tough
Southern California, Angels, AKA LA Sharks
Make comparisons when I seen him duck
Man you think "What was to Pac and Big, before?"
And that was before
I picked up a pen, and when I did, my thumb and my index sore
And then I started writing with it
Found that it flows better, like a Venice Beach sea shore
He don't wear the same clothes as ya'll
He is cut from a different cloth
Ya boy is cool, but I'm a different frost
Like igloo, every time I come off
Every time I take off
Pandemonium when I take off
They hanging on the wing of that G4
30,000 feet and still won't fall
Why you do that for?
Why you had to sell out that store
You made my record sales come up short
My reply is that it ain't my fault
Blame God
I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (I'm coming)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (No lie)
I can't wait when its my time (My time)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got Time)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (No lie)
When the lights get dark
And every body quiet, know its my part
I might start a riot
The main event
Bulletproof under that black tent, you can't shoot through shit
I never played the bench
Star Point Guard
Never pass up money, I'm a ball hog
Touch anything I get my hands on, into pushin' like Ray Charles
I never had no flaws
"Ooos" and "Ahhs" after every bar
Take your bitch, then give her back
For no reason for, just because, ya'll actin hard
I'm bein myself
And I got some plastic under my belt, so rest assured
You don't want your moms thinkin' bout pullin' that hospital cord
Went from a Honda Accord, to a Bentley Azure
Back seat got a flock of broads
And I ain't gotta say to kiss it, just like "Sure"
Momma gon' clean or fix it
Use Terrific, Easter Brum????????
All it need is a little season on
Who said a veteran can't be so young?
I sound better than half ya'll on
Damn K. Dot, let me see your arm
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
Princess cut looks stupid dumb
Eyes close shut, all I see is dollar signs
And I won't get enough till I'm layed in the grave or hand cuffed up bout one time
No Lie
Blame God
I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (I'm coming)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (No lie)
I can't wait when its my time (My time)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got Time)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (No lie)
Yea that's right you better walk away
Go on and walk away cause I'mma burn this motherfucker down
King Kong ain't got shit on me
Running them ghetto streets, I ain't cooking up nothing
But I got the tea kettle on side of me, that metal on side of me
I dare you to follow me, I'm double daring you to follow me where the drama be
His momma in debt, so she can't pay the funeral fee
So wherever them candles at, that's where the funeral be
Kids don't get sleep, guns keep 'em up real late
Walk in the school, shells laying on the concrete
Take 'em to school, show and tell, for that final grade
She gave him a 'F', I say that young boy deserve a 'A'
Cause she never slept where he slept, or seen ricochet bullets rip
Through his cousin's face, ripping his face off
I aim the fifth straight, concentrate like I'm playing golf
I'm Tiger Woods with a gun in my car, I keep one in my car
And keep a bitch with implants, so she keep one in her bra, boom
Shit, make room for the lil bastard
The flyest nigga you seen on centennial campus
The eight ball tucked in my jeans while I'm getting patted down
They didn't know I had it on me, stupid security
No one securing you, if I'm gon' touch you
If I don't like you, the Mossberg pump love you
I take that back, it probably just wanna go and fuck you
Go with you, then dump you inside the coneal confortable
Defending my belt, depending on nobody but myself
Unless you talking 'bout money, I need yo help
I need some help, they say that my screws is loose
Like handlebars on mongoose, this is true
You tough rappers, I'm talking to you
He ain't on no used to shit, but you see his face grew
He say that he fabulous, but really don't have a clue
That he just a puppy living in this zoo
Shit, whoo, with that said, you should know I am the truth
The truth hurts, you should feel pain when I'm done with this verse
I'm done.... psyche, I ain't finished
Ever since the first grade, been bad with the run-on sentence
I never sat the benches in the game of life
I played the whole forty-eight minutes, Christ
I rap with precision and lyrics, is grandma nice
I'm cooking up something, you want you a slice? Then get it
I'm holding my stomach, I'm shitting, I'm farting
On any rapper thinking I'm in his vision, is you retarded?
The CL got my head spinning awkward
Bought it last month, 'bout to put it up for auction
I'm not rapping, I'm talking powerful
And for that dirty money, boy, the Mac'll shower you
The Mac disintegrate, and then devour you
The mag'll forget you, regurgitate and sour you
I world trade you niggas, north and south tower you
Steroid, my authority overpower you, the industry ain't affording me
They might as well just give me my money and start ignoring me
Cause y'all niggas boring me, y'all ain't making no dollars plus no cents
I swear, y'all niggas foreign to me, foreigners
I tell you what, go and tell it to the coroner
Killing 'em whenever my performance come
When I do it, it won't be nothing right after I'm done
When I ruin niggas' careers, put you niggas in tears
Get you pom poms, you better off, cheer for me
Shit, the new money is here for me
I'm on some other shit
Yeah, me too?
I'm on some other shit
Yeah, me too
I'm on some other shit
Yeah, me too?
I'm on some other shit
Yeah, me too
What you on my nigga?
I'm on some other shit
So what you on my nigga?
I'm on some other shit
So what you on my nigga?
I'm on some other shit
Ha ha
Black Hippy
My mind traveling through different dimensions
One of the reasons why they tripping off the rhymes that I'm kicking
Like a Sensai with a black belt, I'm that felt
Give yo ass some pretty wings
I handle Macs well
Arm less sergeant salute me
,Ab-Soul-Loutley
On some other shit leave the booth full of dookie
Off the head like a noogie and my life's like a movie
Play your role while I roll another doobie
To smoke
We got 'em high catch another quote
Look in my eyes, never lie boy I'm on my toes
Like a Korean with nail polish you niggas know
Acting like you don't oh fo sho
Tell 'em soul!
Ha ha!
You know we out your galaxy
An astrologist couldn't find a better analogy
Actually we the last of a dying breed
Living life like its prophecy entirely word up!
Black Hippy
That's all I need to get busy
Turn your music to a Frisbee
Then make your bitch frisk me (come here bitch)
You be holding rifles hoping that someone will like you
Searching for a pill like the late Michael
That's dead wrong
Um...Keep my heart strung
Still fucking hoes like an off drum
Sound of a kitty cat
And it's still a rap beat
How you feel on that
Well I'll sell our music and make moves in the 50 states
The irony is I'm in Compton with foreign plates
Bumping Angel Milk, homie play your part
I be coming down, you coming up short like an Asian bill
Um....I think I need to get my shit together
But whatever still flyer than the weather
Feeling myself so much
I'm sharp I need more tunes to sever
And my polos made of leather cuz
Black Hippy
Killing the game oh yes I am
Bringing the pain as I am
You're just a sweet potato in the pan
Top Dawg is the label when it's written on my shoulder
Top notch on my hand, I'll be such 'till its over
Say hello to the man in demand would 'ya?
They say when you hot then the fans will come
So if I say I'm cold then that's an antonym
You can't stand it huh?
Uh, yo yo
I freak a beat like a nympho when I speak
And so a syllable is like a sex between the sheet
And you can buy your vowel if you show 'em the receipt
To prove that my bars are a hundred grand large
My futures so bright you can see it in the dark
With the blindfold on the hindsight of a blind dude
I'm not cocky I'm just confident fucking raw
Before I knew what a condom is K. Lamar
When I jumped off the porch I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
And, of course, when that took it's course, hoarse when yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
Killers on side of me, privacy obviously was lost
For a piracy of the streets and my Odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed...
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
I walk down the street with no heat and run into beef when I’m just a vegan
Reeking the scent of a saint, sinners smell it then start squeezing
Pellets tumbling straight at my melon, apparent reason...
Because my cousin's cuzzin a Blood
That was Blooding in public and Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't no kin to me, probably Kendrick I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, shoot as your remedy
Fair enough I got enemies but I don’t bang
But that's the repercussion like when your cousin’s cuzzin a blood
And you’re by yourself at the Compton parade
Good Kid
M.A.A.D City
Life or death
Is you with me?
Wassup
Ay yo, where my Compton homeboy at? Kendrick Lamar, haha, yeah
Kurupt, let me erupt (what)
Like flammable gases under the Earth’s crust (uh)
My flammable passion can get the Earth crushed (what)
It’s 2012 once I unveil lyrics that can derail a train of a subway entrance
Say I bust like Jerome Bettis and that’s a must
Offended the best, magnum on my dick defending my flesh
Seven holes like a clarinet
Clarify your worthiness or foresee funeral services
Affirmative action pop up on your furnishing
Unfortunate future for us to fly free under God’s firmament
Me versus whosever’s dead, that’s God’s tournament
Kendrick the Arthritis, hand that hates to write this
What’s good, I’m in your hood like workers of Midas
Purpose is to be righteous
But my Malcolm X is extra’d out like a crip yelling his hood out when he fighting
I never seen a key, all I seen was a triton
I’m always kicking up dust, I’ve never been hiking
I’ve always had a licence for this hip-hop
Influenced by the rap that vocally said they killed cops
I’m riding on E with a bitch that pill pop
Now that’s the irony that I give you when the zip lock
Bag and sell it at doo wop, after that pass the doo wop
Lick a few shots for the few blocks that we on
For ain’t no beat that’s flawed or unique so please don’t try to Xerox
Copy written, niggas bitten
My style since I was backflipping
Inside canals, LA gears with the laces missing
Me Against the World in the background, mama had gave me bowl cut in the kitchen
Big cousin became a statistic, I chose the right flows and remained consistent
Voila, now they got me, haha
Expectations is high, Compton or Bed-Stuy
To them skinny niggas in the Chi bumping Common
But the only thing in common is crime and more violence
I play a little game, you say you fly, I’m over fly
I’m the pilot that’s left on the plane, cloud nine
That’s where I’m at with it
Punchlines till your jaw dented
Catapult your Buick till your car spinning
Watts up, Bad Lucc
Raised by them killers that’ll never bring them kids back
Tiny Archibald on the dirty side of law
I was inches from that building till my bitches tucked the raw, I’m lawless
Hell to the supreme, I should beam that beamer for gleaming
And blame it on that lean cause I’m leaning
Dick off his lady friends in a Bentley, huh
You ain’t seen us in a while, jack
Rastic, I’m god and a buggy is a mousetrap
You’ll become about that, big homies ain’t out yet
Youngins run the city or the biddy like I’m about that
Sharpen my tools, step out the kitchen homie
Is so I’m outside with the Eastside
Sound of the piece and the heat flies
Flat fleece, the fleece bang when niggas get DP’d at beef time
Warren, no Griffin
You listen, you’ll be held accountable to what I’m spitting
I’m Johnny Cage with Timberlands mean I come with me
You got the blogs, I got the streets
I guess we even, not really
I’m cut from a different cloth, rappers pissing them off
Serving drinks out of gun stores, cocktails is Molotovs
I’m bored crazy in a booth, if I don’t get that coupe soon
I swear to God I’ll turn Hip-Hop Awards to a saloon
Move, make way for the fat kid with an attitude
If I batter you, I cook that last meal to faggot food, on mama’s dough
You sugar puffs and honor rolls
I’m angus like, Genghis Khan in my video
You can’t stop it though, from P.F. Changs to Pappadeaux
I eat a nigga up like Domino's, yeah
Now here we go again, from the bed to the floor again
I hear your phone on vibrate and I know it's him
But that's what happens when that kitty's in the lion's den
You start lying and changing places
You might've been, I might've been too aggressive
But it was far from desperate
I mean, the swag I got, just know it's half the effort
They tryin' to toot my own horn
But, shit, I sworn that I swarmed up in it, stamped and fingerprint it
Left the coupe tinted when you played the passenger
Don't be passing up 'til we finish
What we started, you with it? I'm with it
Then lay your seat way back like it was vintage
While I hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach
Camouflage emotions got your feelings wide open
I'm hoping you come to grips
At least before you provoke 'em to trip
But that's inevitable, and if I put you on a pedestal
That means I'm fuckin' you on a chair
As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
This ain't the way my life bout to end
So I'm quick to grab on my pen and
Give 'em something my people sure to feel
Give 'em something that I know is all the way real
As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
This ain't the way my life bout to end
So I'm quick to grab on my pen and
Give 'em something my people sure to feel
Give 'em something that I know is all the way real
Uh, as I'm hearing the first and second verse
I try to analyse the feeling that's felt in the song
I want to tell Rock and Q to go to church
But that's a hypocrite because I ain't been in so long
I stare at the world from a righteous point of view
And realize a crisis coming
Novocain couldn't numb it, the pain is unbearable times two
Let's rally a team, summon, and school the youth
How you feel about it?
As I reflect, I start realizing I wanna
Make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
This ain't the way my life bout to end
So I'm quick to grab on my pen and
Give 'em something my people sure to feel
Give 'em something that I know is all the way real
Mic check Ali
The mic don't sound right
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (Ali get it right)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot
Uhh
Tell em I got plenty arson to sell em
Heat by the fleet displaying it very seldomly
I write till I ignite my cerebellum
Close to the pen like I had 3 felons
Come from a city where niggas show no remorse
And a corpse is just another hommy taking it's course
Of course my dream was to play in the Final Four
Till the twelfth grade came and I was only 5'4
So now I'm a graduate looking to get hired
My pops knew a security job he inquired
But ignorance is bliss, that's what I was told
I stopped, dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired
Now there goes another black boy unemployed
With a lot of free time which means he's vulnerable to run into a lot of crime
I wrote it in my rhymes
And when I left the porch this is what I realized
(Chorus)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah, wassup?)
These streets ain't none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners, .45's and gauges
That could really get outrageous
So I'm thinking to myself, what's next?
My security job only got me like 2 checks
My pops disappointed, told me I'm fuckin' up
Irresponsible and I need some growing up
I told him I would go back, knowing I wouldn't go back
Working a 9 to 5 is something I couldn't stomach
Surrounded by the violence
All the goons and the goblins
With 99 problems I still kept it 100
These streets can be rather manipulating
Especially when you're black and just turned 18
So what's a kid to do, when your fresh out of school and the negatives of the world constantly following you?
Not to mention a local henchman, copped a sheriff's part like terrorists
Osama with badges that talk arrogant
That boy 15 and he holdin' a .45
30 years apart, 30 years before he realized
Uhh
Soon as the beat drop, I bet some heat pop
On a block close to you like a relative
You sippin' Belvedere while these niggas plannin' to rob Mr. Belvedere
Yeah I'm a good kid tryna stay righteous as Martin Luther but it seems like all of my friends eventually become shooters
And niggas bangin' on you is something that you'll get used to
You can either fight back or run home and grab your ruger
Whatever you do just make sure you're willing to do it
Being too indecisive can get you killed inside your Buick
Cuz you stopped at the light, 5 minutes from midnight
With no tinted windows that nigga surely had shot through it
You tell me you listening, but you don't hear the music
Call you Billy Hoyle when turmoil was near
This is the realest right here
When I lost my very first job
My pops said why?
I said I couldn't aim for the sky
Cuz even shooters can get shot
(yeah, yeah, yeah, wassup?)
These streets ain't none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners, .45's and gauges
That could really get outrageous
Two tears in a bucket I'll cry with ya, huh
But I can never lie with ya
I can never afford not to afford
I can never put my plans to the side with ya
I can never see a red light
Like a deer with a head light
I freeze up when I re-up
See I really have patience
If you relatin', only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it
The reason why I never went to work for it?
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intention
They say time heals all
But if I could short cut my success motherfunk all y'all
What's up
(Baby, been funkin for so long)
(Hey-y-y-y)
Ain't that funkin' kind of hard on you?
See, Dr. Funkenstein
(I'm still funkin' for fun)
Two tears and a bucket
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
(I've been doing it from the start)
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
(We ain't never gonna stop)
Two tears and a bucket
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
(Never, never stop, no, no
Never stop, no, no)
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
(No, no
Never stop
No, no, no
Never, never, never stop)
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
Sometimes I look in the mirror and ask myself what I'm scared of
How dare the media portray me this way, I can hear the
Crowd screaming, the weirdest of chants, they all in my ear-a
Artist of era, role model, I can't
It's like I'm a parrot, apparently I'm markin' the dance
I seen done with the devil, such a ghetto romance
How many niggas fall victim, looking at you trapped in the system
Mentally they kept you in prison, and you won't get out, no one visit
Open up your mouth, no one listen, you in denial, nigga
I'm in denial with you, I dial dead homies numbers off this liquor
Time and time again I find myself inside the cerebellum
Of several felons, Orion's belt couldn't live in my world
I seen tigers, lions let loose and spooked, I'm next door to Earl
I guess I rely on Jesus to save us before I refer
The madness, my neighbors witness ski masks
The masses don't know
I'm packin' this four and harassin' your ho
Antagonizin' the business you love the most
See the difference to my approach is a forty ounce at the store
If a forty bounce, to get low
I never learn, I'm hard-headed
The corporate world don't like it, but I said it
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around
Compton Kendrick, something splendid
Yeah I'm in this B-I-itch
No I.D., I be a G, exclude every other alphabet
Every time I D.I.P., I need all of my Ruffle chips
Duffle bag full of Frito Lay, it'll be okay
Don't call OJ because I'm on some killer shit
K Dot in his killer whip
K Dot with his killer dime broadcasted on Channel 9
Lay back, let my seat recline
Rolling like 2 miles per hour
I was with success, I don't know where y'all were
You see it's funny how I do this thing
Throw 'em in the pond cause these pawns wish they knew this king
Say they word is bond like Double 07's service team
They be head servicing, get off my dick
I lay it down so cold, you would swore that I was half Eskimo
In bucket seats below zero
Oh it's me, I'm showing out, I get it crackin'
They never fill my void when I'm absent
Every time I come through, through, through, through
They be on it so thirsty, thirsty
Hoes they be boppin' so thirsty, thirsty
Haters they be watching so thirsty
Yeah, you too, too, too
You be on it so thirsty, thirsty
Hoes they be boppin' so thirsty, thirsty
Haters they be watching so thirsty
I remember, being young, dumb, looking for the next thrill
Angry adolescents, three things on our minds
Money, murder and you
Picture perfect, uh huh
And I paint a perfect picture, my intention's to get richer
But I ain't tryna split the profit with ya
Every pocket on me bleeds, I'm a selfish ass nigga
Mmm, deuces up, black coupes is us (Uh, huh)
Or maybe the white on white, Ku and Klux
Head all in the bathroom
Beg for it, I'll be back soon
Fuckin' problem, fuck your problems
I got my own but one ain't a dollar
I got five phones for five different reasons
London, Tasha, Mya, Keisha
Courtney, blue-eyed devils with no Visas
Overseas, high heels, wine and pizza
Overdosed on bad bitches, I swear
One on both arm but need two pair, I beast
Yeah ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz-is-to-Me-Just-a-Car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya, beast
La da da, the look of lust, yo, yo
Pleasure is a must
I'm sleeping here with lust, scenes of ménages with Asian massages
Sin is the sin of my apartment
She can feel the rhythm as I give her my guitar licks
Mmm... She never knew I was an artist
I play the instrument well in a dark lit room
Please baby gal don't pause this groove
Ever seen a flower in a darkness bloom?
I know you never have, love
And we all got is lust, we don't have love
I think this song started in the bathtub
Then the melody continued to a back rub
You told me your homegirl can play the sax, love
Well show me if she can play my notes perfectly, you're making me a fan
In between your smiles were the sounds of our whispers
As I'm looking down such a bountiful picture
I look at her, then look at you
And both of you make such a beautiful muse for this music
But this is not a Mozart movement, but baby girl keep your composure
I'm not done with composing, it's the look of lust
Say she hate it when I'm super faded
Know that homie notice her body rather her conversation
Rushing, lusting sexual favors when the hours chasing
Midnight at 2 pm, a vampire in Jordan laces
Prey on the blood of the promiscuous
Panties on the premises, pantry full of condoms
Fuck your conscious, let's get intimate
She said, "Baby boy slow down
You know I move with diligence
You think that I'm a ho now and strip me from my innocence?"
Hmm...She was older, she was colder than the rest of 'em
Lurking over my shoulder, temptation getting the best of her
So much... I never knew how to touch a real woman
"Kendrick I want you to make me feel something."
Pulled down my pants and then she glanced at me with a smirk
Repeatedly shook my hand I said, "Whats wrong should I kiss it first?"
I can do that I won't complain
She said, "That ain't a problem I'm wet
But first you gotta fuck my brain like a surgeon
Get your mental working
Like a 9 to 5, before we get it live and close the curtains."
I thought a massage was all I need
Now proceed if it's worth it
Or leave if it's urgent
For you to rendez-vous, I know your needs have a purpose
Cause I have feelings too
And you have feelings, but that's only in your teeth when they're hurting
I started laughing
She pulled my card like pitty-pat
Pity the fool for any kitty-kat, it's the look of lust
The look of lust is in your eyes
A look that you can't disguise
Oh the look of lust is saying so much more than words could ever say
The look of lust is in your eyes
A look you can't disguise
Whatever you want to call it
For the weed heads or for the alcoholics
Now this can be some OG low-rider music
Or you could twist your fingers up and gangbang to it
(gangbang to it)
Whatever you want to call it
For the weed heads or for the alcoholics
Now this can be some OG low-rider music
Or you could twist your fingers up and gangbang to it
(gangbang to it)
Whatever you want to call it
For the weed heads or for the alcoholics
Now this can be some OG low-rider music
Or you could twist your fingers up and gangbang to it
(gangbang to it)
(Bitch)
Have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin' face?
What you say? Oh, you haven't? Alright, wait, bitch (Yeah)
I want the fade (I want the fade)
Give me my fade, I want the fade
I need the fade, I need my-
We gotta fade
Give me my fade (Fade)
We gotta fade (Fade)
Give me my fade, I want the fade
I, I need the fade, fade
Run me my fade, fade
I can't please everybody, not even me
I wanna please God, but my issues too deep
Bless up, gotta change my number every week
Enemigo, I got 'em hot, I got 'em greased
Shut the fuck up, can't you see my daughter sleep?
Shut the fuck up
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the safe house
Can I vent all of my truth? I got nothin' to lose
I got problems in pools, I can swim in my faith
Cameras movin', whenever I'm movin'
The family suin' whatever I make
Murder his stackin', the president actin'
The government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm brackin'
Look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Woah, woah)
Everything jaded (Jaded)
Team on "Go", let's get it (Get it)
Green gon' grow like veggie (Veggie)
Casino on my debit (Debit)
Fuck your rhetoric, fuck your leverage
Chain no evidence, pass go, motherfuck Confederate
Flags on the back of the medicine
Distributed and peddled in ghettos and
Fuck your heritage, fuck your brainwash
Detergent, internet urgent
Time travel in purges, every man and virgin
Fuck chatterin' sermons
Fuck your church propaganda, only God know the answer
We oblige in the cope of state of manic camouflage
Like a sheep so we slide through the cancer, lies and deceit
Vibe like a Phantom, dodgin' police and paramedic retreats
Wanna fuck y'all up for tellin' me "Your life was the one I want"
Been sellin' me concepts ever since I swung
From out of the pro tongue, dedicated myself for recreation
I rest my case, won
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the safe house
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the safe house
I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real people conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close—get money and fuck bitches
I double park the Aston in the red
My momma told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in your head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read—
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, mmm
If I gotta slap a pussy ass, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
Like pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
No, take me out my element
Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece, she worth living
See me on the TV and scream: "That's Uncle Kendrick!"
But it's money to get, bitches to hit, yah
Zeroes to flip, temptation is, yah
First on my list, I can't resist, yah
Everyone together now, know that we forever—
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, mmm
If I gotta slap a pussy ass, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
Like pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
No, take me out my element
I'm going to make it look, I'ma make it look sexy, mm
And they won't take me out my element
Soul brotha, number after one
The brightest out the bunch, compare me to the sun
Skinny as a motherfucka, probably skipped lunch
Hungry with the same appetite as Big Pun
They say I'm too much, I ask how come
There's no one else with opposable thumbs with such a touch
You help a nigga once and he'll probably forget it
You help a nigga twice, you're officially his crutch
I understood this back when I was just a young lad
Couple lies and a couple lines in my notepad
My composition wasn't even competition
Now I'm dropping shit in the booth more than the pot I piss in
And might I mention
I dive in the pool of violent piranhas
You find another guy with my description
My prerogative is simply to annihilate you simply
I got fired from my job, but I gets busy
And I ain't tryin' to ask for more than I deserve
So understand when I say I need a million today
You blend in like chameleon
But I stand out, like I exited the building
Fuck yo feelings, I'm just sayin', you ain't nothin' like Ab, nigga
We're night and day like Meek Mills and Mac Miller
I'm sippin' Remy watchin' Martin droolin' over Gina
If I had the opportunity I'd turn her out, like Tina
But not like Ike, I'd take a much different approach
Roll in a river 'til she hit them high notes
No disrespect, I'm just a nut, tryin' to get some cash
You's another nigga in my way, tryin' to get some scratch
I'm tryin' to get to San Tropez, or somewhere close to that
All cause I heard Jay say it in a fuckin' rap
Now make that ass clap, I know this ain't that type of song
But I get pussy too, they only like me for conscious songs
Whatever that means, I swear I'm so aware
But I wear shades everyday, my vision gotta be impaired
Plus you would think they found me in Korea somewhere
And I'm just another nigga, like Farrakhan with curly hair
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me
Or see me to be just a angel that's easy to please
Angled a company by a gang of niggas that squeeze
Once their marks are your tire marks, that's the fuckin' mark of the beast
I try so hard to follow God
You know, anointed oil, plant some Bibles in the front yard
Rebuke at the turmoil
My dreams of being like Jordan are spoiled
My temperature high that it boiled, 'til your homicide is good for you
I'm loyal to my feelings, I try to stay righteous and cordial
But these feelings are twenty-twos a producer, new Zoo
These gorillas they let loose at 2:45 on 245 street
Colt 45 and shoot, walkin' outside and slippin' like Kenneth Coles
On a slab of grease, body found in a pothole
Forks, white tees just to cover up his long nose
And that bitch'll hang to my knee like a dress
I confess I'm depressed
I suppose I'm more than likely infest my best in the Lima
Hop out, gun your ass down in front of your mama
I try to follow God like Bishop
But when they see that you bitcher, prepare for a ditch of
Dirt, I give you a list of families that hurt, but oh well, fuck it, that's life
And that's the color your son chose to put on tonight
So in self-respect, just know I say it's a honor
Hop out, gunnin' us down in front of your mama, uh
Like kindergartners my vision's bothered
By vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving, the speed on ya
Stampede on ya, impede on your pockets that peed on ya
Dreams of us livin' lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spinnin', established with women, dinin' and laughin'
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash
Into society, take the driver's seat, hope you're fastened
Your seat belts twice when I rolled them dice, I crap
So many times I could build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That's what my mental say, but my physical's been detached
I'm on some other shit, like fuck the government, I'm higher rankings
Where the mothership? I made the covenant that I was changin'
But my luck has been quite disgusting when reality tainted
Where the fuck you been? Left him face down like he was plankin'
In a cold world where old girl and a home boy got a motive
You could bitch, girl your tribulations, that sensation's insultin'
Got a wifey or mistress, nigga which one you indulgin'?
Regardless of who you pick
Know life's a bitch when you ain't focused, nigga
Ughh
Yeah
Kendrick Lamar
Ha ha haha HA
This feels like, right in front of the freeway
And when I'm done this should be in front of a DJ
I watch whack rappers put their soul on Ebay
Then expect excellence knowing their effortless
I don't have a preference, I dislike all
Say you run the globe? Well more like a disco ball
I spread love as well
Little nigga, big dreams, can bear-hug a whale into a lobster's tail
Ugh
Evacuate premises, rap's sinister suspicious
The pastor stand back, the bible is open, the words have been spoken
The moon and the stars align with the bars
The broads are snapping their bras in broad day
Cops meeting their quota running for arcades
The three initial's on the pistols printed all K's
The end is almost near, inferior of nothing
Superior is an option and my synopsis is that I'm Frank Sinatra
On the roster, top running
Running races with my own shadow
Look in the mirror then I start to battle
Now a pyru is a crip, nor a pyru's just a value that is sure to be heard
Like a fuckin sheep's cattle, niggas got some nerve
Talkin bout they move birds
Only thing I move now is a noun and a verb
I am now on the verge of telling the real story
Of a Compton native in the city "that kill for me"
Cus you fabricated the realness
The county building and the county children on food stamps
Glorifying street cred, talkin' about "whoop whamp"
But that's never the case
Just a good lawyer who can sever the case
Recording live from the city where the skinny niggas die and the semi bullets fly
Drinking Remy out bottle till the pain run dry
Like a desert
Once the Desert Eagle ride by, what you reppin?
What you reppin my nigga, you got a weapon?
Well I got a profession my nigga
It's called hip-hop since Pac was on gridlock
Me against the world every hour, every second my nigga
You want something, get something
I could start a career AND I can end one, I'm H1N1
UGH
Straight-A student who flow stupid
Real raps get permanent income, UGH
Beats and bars
Kendrick Lamar
Maestro whattup?
Ha ha haha
...and this is WTOP Radio and I'm your host DJ Turn-Up
I don't turn down nuttin' but my collar
I ain't turnin' down no money
And I ain't turnin' down no mothafuckin' fade
Now bitch if you're pushin' up the street with your orangutan-lookin' ass, take some advice and bang SZA ya flat-foot bitch
Big business, big booty bitches, black on black Benz's
Backing out the back to back my engine, backpack with gats in it
Backflip my dollars and bend Impalas, my arm whistling
Palm flipping, middle finger, fuck y'all, I let it linger
Plush wall and marble floor, ghetto Commodore singing
Tours for my whores swinging, on my heart swore
I pour plenty more semen, or explore cunnilingus
Dummy tore through that boy for pointing fingers
Honey you're a PS4, my game change seasons
And my name explain visas, I defame your name easy
We aim and keep squeezing, bitch my lane say no treason
My chains say no cubic, all y'all look stupid (stupid!)
Big dog, three phone call log stupid (stupid!)
I'm Chris Paul, West Coast, All-Star stupid!
The mantra, the holy trinity, baby your sponsor
My concert and your facility, via del Compton
And Watt's finest!
Nobody pray for me
Even a day for me
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a fella with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know
Bitch, be humble

Who dat fella thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a fellaa, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest dude after all

You're the one who gets my heart to race and my arms to sweat
You're the one I'd risk my life and waste it on a bet
Temptation sweet, I taste it
That casino waitress, drinks sedated
You the one I want, you the one I want, face it
You the one I want on a one-on-one basis
You can see my weakness, a week is not long enough
I need every season and this the only reason
You the one I want, you the one I want
Leave it all on the table even if they catch me cheatin'
Doin' blackjack, twenty-one, twenty thousand in it
Probably twenty more before I'm done
If gambling's a sin, then I'm rollin' dice with Lucifer
To make sure I ain't losin' you
That's what a craps shooter does, I'm bankin' on the win
Bankin' on the last, vacant from the job that I had
Life savings in my pocket
If I never make it back, then I had the option of takin' a risk
So before I slit my wrist, I'm a cash in on this last poker chip
You can bet
Ok now shorty had yellow
Shorty eyes brown
Shorty so gold
And so is my crown
Baby color me red
Shorty code red
And so is my flag
Purple in my bag
And shorty hair black
And so is that card
That I got in my bag
How could I go Hard from my girl in fact
I could take a ball from the world
Since the president black
I went and bought a black pearls
Like damn
And she gonna wanna see lil wayne go
She just wanna bonnafie lil wayne boe
Now or later cause me and her gonna create art together
Ohhhh
She wanna do it has we do it all night
I never blew it hurt my lung
I only look nice
See the wall black and I dress all white
Yeaaa
Mama says she love it when I'm color coordinated
So I pull up in a maroon coupe with maroon laces
In my Supras I maneuver like
MacGyver when it's time to ride
Say she always feeling blue
When he telling white lies
Rain on her window pain
All she see is grey skies
Told her hit this purple
Maybe this will ease your mind
I'm rocking purple lable
Check out my shirt design
Perfect with her purple kisses
Slack track number eight
From The Dream maybe this is something you ain't neva see
Put you in a real world
Take you out that green screen
Sippin on pink panties
In the stretched limousine
They takin off pink panties
When we hit the room please
Don't confuse me for no murderer like Norman Bates
But I'm about to kill it
Pull out the yellow tape
I'm guessing I'm a criminal
You caught up in my web
Like a brown recluse
K. Dot is a color never seen boo
She love it when I'm flamed up
Valet park the Red Lamborghini at the Grand Lux
Grammys with the red tux
She a red bone
Red manicure
Red hair
Think I like her
Might wife her in some red airs
Walk her up my red stairs
Headed to the red room
She gone yell code red once I jump in that womb
Red diamonds on my wrist, red diamonds on my neck
Give yo' ass a blood bath, if you ever disrespect
Red lobster, you a small fish walking thru my set
Red beam, I'm aiming from the roof of my projects
She know that I'm gangster, she read that I'm a prospect
Eatin' red beans, shittin' on em, "Where the flys at?"
Red in my pupils and that's just from the contact
She wanna blow up I'm a show her where that bomb at
So baby ride with the red flow
Her face turned red soon as I said let's go
Yea Ohhh
Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhhh Yeahhhhh
Ohhhhhhh Ohhhh Ehhhhhh
Hahaha That's right baby
I'm gone
West coast tsunami come jump inside of a wave pool
Fresh out the county with beepers over their ankles
Bitches and bugs their earlobes flooded with bengals
38 slug passenger seat let it bang you
I was born the same year you was rocking a kangol
20 years later my style favor a kangaroo
Jumping off the ground im tapping the star spangle
Banner with manners over ignorant lost angels
Cameras flash nappy hippy from every angle
Hammers will blast snap and hit you from every angle
Like a porno no homo you wear rainbow
I'm with a bad chick that can suck on my mandingo
Your making publicity stunts to make your name blow
Im dropping c4 every month to make my name blow
Drive a hoopty every month like its a range rove
Get in on the passenger side because the door broke
Take you on a natural high this is for sure dope
Watch you go be outside then give you more dope
Im gonna flood the streets outside go buy a raincoat
Open the door my tapes fall out your Durango
West coast till im gone and wearing a halo
Til then im ready for war lets play halo
Take down the fifth of Hennessy and watch the day go
Bye like farewell can somebody just pray for
Me like holiest priest on gods payroll
Tabernacle to all the Church's chickens I ate on
Its K.Dot you motherfucker motherfucker mother blucka blucka bring a ruckus better duck em make you suffer quick suck a dick
My niggas we all gotcha
My niggas is all shottas
And niggas ain't nothing but bitches they all gossip
My words come hard like a bishop in tranquilizer
And murder goes hand and hand like sanitizers
I been a problem shootout to Problem
Yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
Two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job
A month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that her mother said she won't see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges brought up
I shook my head, turned around then found a $100
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why
Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor
I stormed out then seen a black Honda Accord
Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
Closed my eyes then asked myself how I was feeling
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willing
I came to grips, jumped up, and looked out the window
See my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this is meant for
Me to give them a $100 then trash my pistol
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
This is a public service announcement
We call it Blood Sport
I had to do one too, I sorry! I'm a competitor
Oh my god it about to get hideous
I hope ya niggas know you history
Homie go ask Doc (talk about me)
Homie go ask Nas (and he'll tell ya)
Homie go ask Jay (young fella)
But when you ask them all (don't be jealous)
I'm the best in LA. In LA
Or wherever the fuck that you stay
It's all copastetic. Hip-hop no longer face Armageddon
Call me Bruce Willis
No call me lieutenant tinted windows on the black benz
So they only see it late nights like Jay Leno
I fuck twice your girlfriend probly told you we can't fuck
No she lying
Oh my god I am the best rapper under 25 you can underline it
You abusing the game you defiant
Disobedient student need attention
Have parent conference I'll be there, Just let me know what classroom you in my son
I am Dwyane Wade of recording
You more like Kobe Bryant with no endorsements
That's like Shaq at the freethrow, pointless
I'm equivalent to a Earl Boykins, Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues
I suppose I handle the rock well
I do hoes like Stockton and Malone: make my pick then roll
The ugly ones go to Sam Cassell
You washed up like Nick Van Exel.
Shawn Kemp, Robert Parish, John Salley whole career on the bench
Let's get deeper in these NBA statistics
My team something like the retro Celtics
Which means consecutive championships
Which means I'm Larry Bird's equivalent
To the way I do a verse he handle the ball
The same way I handle it with no pen
I call Jay Rock when I wanna dish it off
He bang like Vince Carter when he first saw NBA Court
Alley oop the court let him do what he want
Bang. Aw fuck it let's talk more sports
How bout football?
I run the game like Walter Payton back 1984
I'm pass you niggas like Peyton Manning
Play the field like Ray Buchanan
When I kick it like Morton Anderson it gets scary
Weight on my shoulder, refrigerator Perry
Hip-hop cops on me I dodge them like Barry
Sanders... John Madden hold your commentary
Keep the cameras on I'm primetime like the '95 Deion
Should I keep going?
Aw fuck it let me keep going
I'mma do it like the '97 T Owens
Not the ‘07 T Owens
T Owens with Jeff Garcia throwing the pigskin
Y'all need to work on y'all defense, I train like Warren Sapp on the weekend
Maneuver like Warrick Dunn
I'm just having a little fun have some with me
Let's go baseball now the '94 Ken Griffey
One man roster matter fact I'm the '96 Mike Piazza
MVP of LA, call the doctor
I came up with my assumptions I must be rap ESPN or something
It’s about time for halftime reporting
I’m a star kicking niggas off the field and court man
I know you good with the right but you still ain’t nice till you do it with the left hand
You ain’t nice till you play all positions
Or knock it out the stadium, hey wait a min
I got tickets to the all star game, to pro bowl game baby girl bring a friend
I’m a get you in, I’m a take you out, I’m a stick it in
You might say… ouch

Dribble my balls to the floor one time
I’d be going for a week bet they gon’ miss me more than a pitch from Nolan Ryan

ArtRAVE
Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
Hi, I want to come and make peace with you
But they won't let me
No, they won't let me through
I don't mind if they a-arrest me
'Cause I'm wearing my Versace
Why can't we just put on a smile and a buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz?
We all might be sick
Whether it's at first or after a few drinks
We're gonna unite, don't think
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West
My name is Lady Gaga
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West
My name is Lady Gaga
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby smoke it up 'til we're high
(Now Jump)
In a way, exhausting
We're problem solving
Drink 'til she's attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
Talking 'bout diplomatic
I brought my plastic
Making that peace attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
When I jumped off the porch
I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
And, of course, when that took its course
I was hoarse from yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
The killers on sight of me, privacy obviously was lost
And the fraud piracy of the streets in my odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
I walked down the street with no heat
And run into beef when I'm just a vegan
Reekin’ the scent of a saint, sinner smell it then start squeezing
Pellets that's tumblin' straight at my melon, apparent reason
Probably was because of my cousin cuzzin’ a blood
That was bloodin' in public
And Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't no kin to me, 'stead of Kendrick, I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, sure that's your remedy
Fair enough, I got enemies but I don't bang
But that's the repercussions like
When your cousin is cuzzin’ a blood
Then you’re by yourself at the Compton parade, he said:
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang (Pump, pump)
A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I’m really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
I seen 'em from afar then I seen a piece of my jaw
Like on the ground, you know the sound
When you hear the people in awe
Sympathetic 'cause they like seeing you
Tryna fight back at a pack of piranhas
I promised three of ’em, beat the black off my back
And pajamas was almost needed
I should've went to sleep and seen some sheep
When I greeted the pavement
Got up and seen the shock on their faces
Like "damn it, he made it"
My luck in the palm of a cherry bomb
And they waitin' to blow up on me
My homies are not alarmed
Then I heard someone's firearm
Make a sound like it waved around my direction
I'm guessing this is the part where my heart
Expected to drop in a second, look at the faults
I've made in the shortest amount of time
And in back of my mind I'm like "this the loss I'ma take"
My fate was distraught
A cape and some superpowers can't save me
I'm probably pushing up daisies
Before I can make my way to the car
Cross cancel and right before I seen
The black glove raisin' the handle, he said:
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang (Pump, pump)
A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I'm really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Bitch, I'm bustin' back, I'ma borrow my uncle's strap in a minute
Jump in a Civic then wear that bitch on my lap
I was timid but now I'm tempted
And tenants alert me on where you at
I'm a menace when I'm offended, relentless, I will react
Then somebody said the dispatch
Of an officer, got his mind made on off'n ya
That's a fact when you're black and undeveloped
You're profiled as a felon
I'm bellin' down Boulevards with my basketball and a backpack
Gym shoes and my nap sack
Hair nappy, my ball cap backwards
And then I look back, strobe lights on my tail pipe
Turned left then I turned right
Turned deaf 'cause the sirens is loud
As the colors of pink and yellow on Wesley Snipes
Pray to God I don't get sniped
Pray to God that the sunlight stay shining for 30 more minutes
Hope that a witness around when I'm 'bout to cut off the engine
Vengeance of hatred is what I'm facin'
Even though being a criminal ain't my memo
But this is what he said when I dropped the window:
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang
By the time you hear the next shot, you'll learn that L.A.P.D. is the biggest gang (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I'm really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Let your fears go and catch your blessings, yeah
Let them hoes know you don't do messy, yeah
Screensaver on because they dry snitch
Caption on your post saying "You my bitch"
Tell me that you're leery
Tell me you gon' get in trouble
You don't want the city
You don't want 'em all to judge you
Ex-man said he caught a fair case
Young bull slid in for the Segway
I touch down, smokin' dope on the daily
Come here lil' baby, know you're birthday ready
I'll turn you out if you want, if you let me
Don't save face, don't save face
Your friends go, yeah, your friends throw salt on you
Your friends go, they gon' hate and say what not to do
But friends go, if it's you then who you lyin' to?
Don't save face, don't save face
I want you here, then what's your heart gon' say?
I want you here, baby, don't walk away
You know for real, I would go out my way
When we gon' slide?
I wanna build wit' you, I wanna vibe
Sleepin' on explosives, everything live
I'ma get you open, one day at a time
Put that on God, man, I put that on God
Won't you meet me out?
I touch down, smokin' dope on the daily
Come here lil' baby, know you're birthday ready
I'll turn you out if you want, if you let me
Don't save face, don't save face
Your friends go, yeah, your friends throw salt on you
Your friends go, they gon' hate and say what not to do
But friends go, if it's you then who you lyin' to?
Don't save face, don't save face
I want you here, then what's your heart gon' say?
I want you here, baby, don't walk away
You know for real, I would go out my way
When we gon' slide?
I wanna build wit' you, I wanna vibe
Sleepin' on explosives, everything live
I'ma get you open, one day at a time
Put that on God, man, I put that on God
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what’s the, what’s the, what’s the scenario (x2)
Crept up in this muthafucka soundin like a stun gun
Fresh up out the hotbox got me smellin' like marijuana
Flyer than a Desert Eagle when it’s starin’ down lookin’ at my people
Shootin muthafuckas down just because I’m evil
Live and direct like Cable TV pay-per view pay me
Who Q? Ha-chu yeah blessed it, beautifulest tune
You’ll tune on the record
Everything is coke so I kick like Liu Kang
Thinkin you can really get with this man you playin
Get you a platoon, yeah floatin’ like balloons
Get so high got to space then I shitted on the moon
Went into a rage now the sun won’t shade Mars
Know I got bars so I’m aimin for the stars
Everyone applaud, praise to the genius
Never would like to let the hoes bow to the penis
Feenish
Kendrick relentless in other words a dentist
I’m in they mouth without a doubt
It’s funky grab an incent
Grab a honkey, grab a nigga, grab a wetback, grab a chink
Then put ‘em in a box like Michael and Leon Spinks
Then tell me what you get for cultures feeling me
As if they was blind and braille on my sleeve
Peace, to hip-hop, down to earth
Word to the voice of Chris Rock
Can I rock like a '88 Camaro and T-Top
Whoa, the scenario seem to flip like an aerial
As I dip like a pull-up bar at the gym
Won’t you witness the gem
I’m a troop from Angola and
You a cop on patrol that’s trying to Axel Foley
As dumb as Napoleon Dynamite and I’m quick to blow up then BOOM
Combustible like flames and petroleum
It’s Jay Rock
Niggas know my status
Flip flows like a gymnast on a apparatus
Leave yo body in pain if I hit you with this ‘matic
Don’t even speak if you ain’t talkin cabbage
Loyal to the cash, thinkin’ ‘bout a marriage
Committed to the block that’s somethin’ niggas cherish
Hmm.. if you dissin’, you missing Parish
Then I’m on a mission, fishin Paris
Lookin’ at some dimes, go get your cameras
Black Hippy emcees and we got hammers
Gang member slash rap nigga
The name’s Rock, all the hoes call me that nigga
Never relax, never do that
Soon as you relax, them lames is stealin’ ya swag
I’m the truth in the booth I’m killin’ the track
To the point of no return no bringin’ It back
I’m so fluent on the beat just spittin’ the facts
You lames lyin, think you chief
You bridgin’ the gap
I’m the fountain of youth, you niggas is tap
Like bugs in the phone, you niggas is wack
Enter the mind of the utmost divine
Heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
Twilight zone, war with the star
Hans Soulo
Top Dawg, not Todo, notch logo
On my hand, knock you out
Goddamn!
Say I’m not lethal, inhumane
Squeeze juice out a beetle
Offended John Lennon come to cloud 9
That’s where the cockpit is
Me and Kendrick Lamar startling all contenders
ScHoolboy Q, gangsta with a USC student IQ
And Jay Rock a fuckin’ fool
You make the wrong fuckin move
He like “DON’T FUCKIN’ MOVE!”
Aimin’ at you with the tool
I’m like what am I to do?
Crazy how the shit we make come out phenomenal
Black Hippy, and as for me I’m the black sheep passin’ weed
To Miss Bo-Peep
Peep!
Soul!
Yeah. How I sound out there Ali? Good? Then good
Can I pay my past a visit?
Centennial Compton School District
And video campus shut the fuck up your premises
King Drew and Westchester had the baddest bitches
And my nigga L Wood had a white Toyota, and we got pulled over
Had to hide the bottle because there was mix with Hennessy and soda
Every time we rode up we was unsober
And everybody had know that
My nigga Yan Yan had all the red P Hat
Which was really dumb because where we was at
Was the other side and more than likely
The other side really didn't like that
Didn't have no burner so if they shot us we could never really shoot back
Could of lost our life over hood rats
We was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we was lucky enough
That the black car didn't pull up and ask where yall niggas from
I know some, nigga less fortunate was fucking with the enemies' bitch
She had a fat ass and a brown Camaro but it wasn't that fast it was like a V6
But anyways she was one of those hoes in highschool with the cornrows
Size 5 Jordans, Rolex sporting, and wanna fight everybody she knows
Well she's important, well she wasn't, she was just so and so so and so cousin
He was a red, so anytime she got into it, that who she would get
Now let me get back to the plan
Homie had ask, " Do ya got a man?"
She said,"No", he said, "Oh yeah
Where do you stay?" She said, " Rosecrans"
Rosecrans and what? She said, "Don't matter just know I fuck
He said, "What? you're a, you're a little freaky bitch huh?"
She said, "Yeah daddy I can you get you sprung
I can work that pussy and the tongue
If you come over I can make you cum
If you come over make sure that you bring drink
Because I like to get to drunk."
And that he did, that Friday he was where she lived
Notice that he was out of bounds
But didn't give a fuck cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
Walked in the house, rubber on, panties down
Oldies playing in the background
Let's get it on Marvin Gaye had bumped to the morning
Time to go, picked his pants up off the floor
Kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door
When he walked out he seen a four four Bluh!
Didn't know that was the pussy he was dealing with
And that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
Get your ass killed bitch! How?
Fucking with them hoes, them hoes, them hoes, them hoes
Them hoes hoes, them scandalous hoes
Them hoes hoes will have you uh dead dead dead
Look. I guess we all can learn from mistakes
But your first mistake, might be your death date
And death doesn't wait, on no one
A million ways to die, and you can make it a million and one
If you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else shoes
Like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude
He wasn't thirteen he was twenty two
When he went to first get put on the hood
He wasn't born it, Boys in the Hood the movie made him think it was all good
But usually this type of person want to prove his s s s s self on purpose
Tell everybody quit working, but really he's worthless
His momma had money, his daddy had money, so he had money
The OG's that gave him a pistol, think that he was gonna be just another crash dummy
And the funny thing about it he thought he was bout it like P-Miller
But he wasn't no killa
Just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas
Everybody wanna be tough guy so he did, approached this guy like, "Where are you from?" with his gun but didn't shoot it, rule number one
Never pull out if you don't use it
Even though the dude didn't banged the very next day he seen around the way blew his brains out while homeboy was cruising
Not knowing the scariest nigga will split your shit
And that's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
Fuck around and get your ass killed bitch! How?
Not knowing the G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, if you don't know then your already dead dead dead
Feel me?
Welcome to the wild side, Hub city's wild side
Where tecs fly that's homicide, my stacks like a mile high
Fly as a bitch, got a condo on cloud 9
Slap box with God, jump off heaven and skydive
So supernatural K.dot come and see me on Sci-Fi
From 5-6 with five nines two mac-10s and Glock nines
Lets do this however whenever tell em I'm ready
Waters run deep way before Katrina broke the levee
Look partner, I'm no gangster, I'm no killer
But please believe I know plenty gangsters that'll kill ya
I don't like you, I don't feel ya you're very unfamiliar
So please build your catalog before I knock your cattle off
This saddle off on a red horse that's a red Porsche
That's not your favorite rapper in the booth
That's a dead corpse once K.dot kick chaos
Niggas bitch off like canines click up and click, click, click boom
Smell the fumes on my Levis
Bitches poppin' pills and mushrooms in my hotel rooms
I squeeze dick through their thick thighs then bounce like this beat from T.Dot
Six T.Vs in my new SUV F-U-C-K-Y-O-U pay me
Or pay me no attention and meet the criminal henchmen
Genesis ain't shit, I know local henchmen
Come shoot me I'm in a two seater with hootie, motherfucker
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Hub city's wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Hub city's wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Hub city's wild side
Where tecs fly, that's homicide
My stacks like a mile high
Ay, on my momma nigga, I'mma be the greatest to ever do this shit
On my momma though, like, on the dead homies
Ay, Sounwave, turn this shit up, nigga, turn this shit up
Sounwave, turn this shit up, nigga
Tell me who the bitch nigga hatin' on me
Jumpin' on my dick, but this dick ain't free
To Pimp a Butterfly another classic CD
A ghetto lullaby for every one-day emcee
Nigga, now RIP you
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Oh, hey
Winter with the raindrop
You can make the rain stop
You can make the pain stop
Heart pumping, novacaine
Speed through the motor lane
Race to your doorstep, feign for the short thing
Issue that I miss you, wanna kiss you on your neck, aye
Get you then I pin you to the post on your bed, ayy
Feelings turn to a brickwall, there I was
Told me that you got a new love but I...
No more “please stop”
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa
Oh hey
Oh, oh hey
Oh, oh, oh hey
Uh oh, uh oh
Cloud nine, where you can find me and my dime
Like Roosevelt in his prime, wait till I'm in my prime
The moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion
To whom say he cool
But the irony is I can hold the bottom of an iron
With the bottom of my palm
I say so much so little, all action, no talk
Like a mime throwin' up gang signs
It's not all about punchlines, I don't do that
I'm a jaguar, you just a new cat, now move back
Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success
Aimin' for the top like an AR aimed at your neck
I can never digress ‘less I get demoted to death
Even then I’ll be the best still like a petty theft
I will conquer my biggest dreams
Once you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings
Nipsey got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred
And all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head
But still they’ll feel me cause we all ate cereal
Humped the momma friend daughter while they bump the stereo
Backflips on shoppin' carts, free lunch at the park
Watched Power Rangers after school, here we go
I’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise
For no fussy-ass A&R or TEO
We ain't what you think and you think we back
But we been here for decades and I vouch for that
Open your mouth for that
Speak well like a great debater over iChat
Get your other eye cracked
I don’t rap, I Iraq and declare war
I enjoy watchin' enemies' blood pour
I came up lower middle class, not poor
So don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me
I need y’all to feel me
And if you feelin' froggy to leap, then feel free
My feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived
By the ultimate prize I'm a get when I see your suicide
Too hot to handle, too dope to hold
Two dope boys, we roll deep, everybody gather your seats
We goin' to cloud nine, we comin' back in a week
And the weak good riddance
Only the strong permitted to ride and test drive
With Kendrick the Jedi
One of a kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters, I tell 'em, 'Hi', enemies, I don't tell 'em shit but puta
Click, booyah, click, click
Splash blocks like Dikembe when I sensai, who wanna shoot?
The liquor hear me, I'm off the Remy like Papoose
I got the truths of a thousand bishops
Troops of a thousand niggas, you can get your ass missing
Like a white bitch with big tits to be specific
I'm over they heads when the words get pledged
Fright night, gun tucked tight like a newborn
Dance with the Devil, hopefully you get your groove on
When I blaze this metal
Like a rolling stone, flesh and bones come out
Like a thug reunion, watch yall dumb out
Most likely, half of you fraudulent niggas don't like me
Scared to fight me even if you had hands just like me
K Dot, bare arms like a haltertop
Live from the barbershop, who want a fade?
Who want war? I got a drawer full of hand grenades
Take it back to them Contra days, so fall back
It's real, off cognac, and pills, we twist caps then peel
Bananas with the hammers, play if you will
A bullet proof for a shield, that won't work
I got big big very big big bullets, and they hurt
Lift up your skirt if you play pussy, don't push me, I'm light
You pushing up daisies, if the pump do a push up tonight
I put, I put a new price on your head, like a mannequin dressed well
Students from Harvard can hear the nigga Yale
I'm cold hearted, oh well
I get's retarded, the yellow bus I'm a park it
In front of your house, hop out, gun in ya mouth (Blakka!)
Duck shows in your peek hole, me and my Hoover crip
But all I bang is your bitch, don't get me twist
Let's do this, I'm ludicrous, disturbing the peace
Pacing back and forth like a stewardess, it's plain to see
Da Evils
My nigga we out here, four door Cutlass
Ain't enough room for your luggage
Don't trip
You fabricate to the public we don’t believe shit
Believe it or not call your bluff then leave your ass wit knots
The juggernaut is in your rectum, call Pac and resurrect him
I'm sure to cause a spectrum
Especially with my mental telepathy start to f' em aka fuck'em
Aka nothings in my way once I start b-b-bucking
Fuck up your function and your house party my life's shortly about fortune and vice
If the feds caught me I tread softly the judge toss me life
And your autopsy and my posse came through properly right
Everyone's watching me all right if you're not watching me like
Sent my big cousin a kite got my shit buzzing when there wasn't even a doorbell, a insect or light year in sight
Amen now won't you be a man and pay respects
Enjoy as we progress destroy ya baby steps
Enjoy Son Enjoy son
Enjoy Son Enjoy son
Enjoy Son
Come on
Me, I've been searching, for that right one
And hopefully I found her
I found her
My nigga tells me 'bout this girl that he knows, oh
Said she the type of girl that I'm looking for, oh
Shout me her number and said make sure I call, oh
Got straight to the point when she picked up the phone
When she picked up the phone she said hello and I said
A friend of mine said that you were the one for me
A friend of mine said that you was with everything
A friend of mine said that you are good company
A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby
Got good pussy baby
Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious
I want it baby
Gotta have it baby
Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious
Now girl I don't mean to come off so strong
But I heard that you got the love that I want
Can you promise me that it's true what they say?
Before you tell me your name? Is you with it?
A friend of mine said that you were the one for me
A friend of mine said that you was with everything
A friend of mine said that you are good company
A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby
Got good pussy baby
Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious
I want it baby
Gotta have it baby
Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious
{Bridge}
Tell me is you with it?
Is you with it? (4 times)
Tell me are you with it?
Are you with it? (4 more times)
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
That coochie, that twat, that pussy stuff
Whatever you wanna call it, I can't get enough
I can be your lover, be your friend
Be your number one or your ten
Baby yell dress, and just like UPS or FedEx girl we can both send
Then pray in the morning, then after we pray more play in the morning
Have it your way like a shoe custom made whenever you need
Or maybe like a chain of Burger King's
I promise if we do it, I'll remain serene
I truly understand
Nobody gotta know like a group of yes men
So momma don't trip
And if it goes well we can make you a flip
So what it's gon' be miss lady my clock is tickin'
So please tell me you accept my proposition
Are you gonna tell me now?
Or you need more time if you do that's fine
As long as it goes down, girl make up your mind
Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac
In his prime, thug life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscing when the LA Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
Snapback fitted
Snapback fitted
Snapback fitted
On my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickriding, I'm addicted to
Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
"Compton!", a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit
Can't block or
Can't block or
Can't block or
Screen that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit
Now everybody sing that shit
I'm addicted to
Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
Scream that shit
Never went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit
Can't block or
Can't block or
Can't block or
Screen that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit
Ayy, chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks
Chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks

Chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks
Ayy, ouu-ouu, ayy, ouu-ouu
Ayy, chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks
Chopsticks, chopsticks, chopsticks
Ayy, ouu-ouu, ayy, ouu-ouu
Uh, Soon as I enter
I put a hurting on it
If I don’t kill it she injured
For a Long time
Summer, spring and winter
Fall for anything, you clumsy ass nigga
Jumping off the boat in some 87' Locs
She’s seen them hundred spokes
And then that woman spoke
But I don’t talk back, I put my life on tracks
If that don’t work put your wife on track
Show me where the candle wax
It must be you, cuz I burn right through
Everything ya’ll do
High octane when I bring on my last name
Mr. Lamar AKA “The Cash King"
Quicker than pre-cum won’t you give her a reason;
To not meet up with me like a vegan
Psssst! God-Damn I’m the fuckin man
She said fuck her man
Now she fuck with Mann
Everytime I close my eyes I see a different dream
I pray to God that we don’t close until we reach our dreams
College tuition for daughters and I ain’t even father
Now I got a rebel at the altar call me prince or king
Six digits for me like we did to offer
I used to call me Waldo, and now they call me Walter
Yeah, I hide in them uckle pants, living without a purpose, man
But that just got my circumstances
And I mean it, if you want it, come and get it, boy
Death come in threes and you’re looking like triplets boys
In high school I climbed the roof so I could smoke my weed
The dealers knew that I was young and sold me bag of seeds
I’m chasing dreams, hoes chasing me
But I just gave the name and number like the maitre D
‘cause all I wanna do was roll up hash and smash the ass of a bitch who lived like Kim Kardashian
She is the last straw, I’ve bend her and slip slow
My pencil draws her closer, she gets high and bends low
Long flight from my Cali mistress, to a district with red lights
Prostitutes and rich niggas, just a recipe for long nights
Shake well and all they do, I’m laying next to some girl who last night showed me things I never knew
Either I’m bending space out or I’m just bending space in
I put my heart on tracks, but it’s four AM and that chick’s still racing
One bed, two girls, three way, four times
My shame came off their clothes, it’s paradise of the mind
Absolute vodka mixed with absolute freedom
I meet my darker side and it’s a pleasure just to meet him
I’m thinking about puffing and writing while fucking
Yesterday’s gone and tomorrow ain’t come
And if tomorrow ain’t come and that’s the name that she told me
But when you hit this level, every first name is phoneme
But here, the air tastes better, weed is more potent and girls seem wetter
Days are a haze and drinks just stronger, nocturnal nigga, these nights seem longer
I’m only here for one night, it’s Disneyland for man, white girls, blue kush, red lights
America and Amster…damn
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, you know that it's big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You know you're evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real higga
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Trap our bodies but can't lock our minds
Everybody just stop
(The bigger I shoot)
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Lock our body, can't trap our mind
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be a-
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty women and women, and it's the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Everything I know, karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
Tell em' other gangsters silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, down before
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world, "Where do we go?"
I'm at the preacher's door
They wanna kill us dead, at the preacher's door
We said give 'em some more
This one time, do it fo' sho
But we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright (hello)
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright (P!)
We gon' be alright (hello)
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want, you a house, you a car?
Acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
You can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can smell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Diggin' in my pocket, candy paint it on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see
I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see
I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all
I rap, I'm black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with...
God
It's been a week already
Feeling weak already
Got me at peak, possibility of what could be
Situation is heavy, I've got to prove
On February twenty sixth I lost my life too
It's like I'm here in a dark dream
Nightmare, hear screams recorded
Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was
That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood
Why didn't he defend himself? Why couldn't he throw a punch?
And for our community do you know what this does?
Add to a trail of hatred
Twenty twelve was taped for the world to see
Set us back another four-hundred years
This is modern day slavery
The reason why I'm by your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your son jumps into your arms
Cut off the engine then sped off in a Wraith
I'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk
Had the vodka on the top
How come I can long time
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
See I'm living with anxiety
Giving up sobriety
Cussing with his sister
And playing with society
Justice ain't free
Therefore justice ain't me
Try and justify staying, obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinking to myself
Hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinking by myself
At the end of Section Park
Caught you when you walk besides your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your son jumps into your arms
The engine then sped off in a wraith
I said Hiiipower, one time you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us
It's over, it's really over
Kobe really retired, it's crazy!
It's just a trip to even be doing this right now
Kobe really retiring
Call in marks, Kendrick take one
What can I say?
I mean really, what can we say?
Day by day, season by season, twenty, to be exact
Growing up watching him paint murals
Using this building as his first studio
Using L.A. as his canvas
Restoring crowns back to where they belong
Under royal banners, purple and gold
The color of royalty
My one man L.A. king
Back to Kobe, fallaway pull up
Oh! What a way to finish!
Kobe
Never meaningless could never mean less
That's what he means at this moment
All season has been his goodbye
Him to us, us to him, to the whole world
Still got magic, but he made it magical
From Compton to Crenshaw
Jack to Jeanie
We were all witnesses
To all things that was him
I mean, we shared with him the world
Kobe, inside the three point arc...
Kobe Bryant has hit a shot at the buzzer!
WOO!
Soon enough, he became our identity
If you wasn't born and raised here
Or never lived here
You probably would never understand
I'm-a make sure you do
I'm talking about the 81 points
I'm talking about the afro
I'm talking about the alleyoop to Shaq
The off-glass buzzer beater over D-Wade
The game four overtime takeover in the Finals
Kobe
I'm talking about the posterizing of Steve Nash
I'm talking about Dwight Howard's rookie year when he got baptized
You remember that
Kobe bodied him
The helicopter
The five parades
Kobe
The mashed-up gamut of emotions with you and with ourselves is so deep
I don't think nobody can break that bond
So I ask, how do empires last when there's no longer an emperor?
I mean, we got you
But at the same time, we got you
I'm talking about your blood, your sweat, your tears
Even your DNA is placed in these L.A. concretes, man
And nothing would ever replace that or erase that
Forever great in our hearts
So with that being said
Know that it's never goodbye
It's simply respect due
Our due, forever
Kobe
I'm the coolest nigga you know
Migrated from the North Pole when I was fo'
Infatuated with cartoons and G.I. Joes
'Till something more greater took a toll: life
Not really, more like white Air Nikes
Evidently, I had a fondness for material things
Ten years old trynna get a 10-K ring
I forgot it was for me when the phone ringed
Elementary girls callin' the house
Desiree and Cheryl mama end hustled what we talkin' about
I'm talkin' about the good old days when we walked without knowing that could be our last time walking out
Now we can't walk witout protection
Bein' on the defensive, life ills
This life will put you in a crazy world
Just by knowing crime will never cure
So I'm strapped like Girbaud jeans
I'd rather see the pen like I was bowling
Rather than death, walkin' on heavy steps
It's a great place, but I ain't ready for Heaven yet
So I told God put me at the back of the line
Matter fact yesterday, swear to God I ain't lyin'
Movin' at a turtle pace, cause the fast lane got a day one uncle with one in the brain
Got one in the chamber
Sixteen in the clip, my eyes fluttered with anger
Hip-hop trynna save my life
Give credit whenever it's due, the money touchin' the roof
Breakin' the ceiling, with that being I'm breakin' the loot
With my loved ones, life way too short, son
I was on the block, ducking, running from cops
On the corner slanging the rock (Mama she used to pray for me)
Now I'm on top, pulling up in the drop
Saying peace to hip-hop (Cause it made a way for me)
I struggled way before I got on
So I gotta put my struggle in song (I guess this was my destiny)
Came a long way, I'm here to stay
Reporting live from where reporters die
Newscasters coming too early witnessing homocides
Pearly gates forming in the sky as we wait for your suit and tie
I tailor-made it for you then told Khalifa he loves you
I'm really stuck on this bumpy ride
Highway to hell 'less I flip through a demon's TV-guide
An angel said he seen me fry
Ducking bullets
I promise I couldn't stop the work my niggas have put in
Your brains is banana pudding
I'm looking for trouble, looking for hustle
I'm a grinder, choppas in the path finder
I ain't no killa, I ain't no drug dealer
I'm a real nigga with real emotions that stand behind a
Brick wall, you knock it down then I'm forced to align ya
With the stars of Venus and Jupiter
You ain't ain't gangsta, you fooling us
The government don't know what to do with us
Internal affairs investigate while LAPD speculate
Crooked cops on my bumper dumping 'til I'm first 48
I can smell a snake a mile away because they reek hate
But any anaconda can die on a weekday
Wikipedia speeding up my career like I've been here
And I don't fuck with these fuck rappers cause they been weird
Been on my dick, get addicted to dying quick
Grab a dictionary, my styles vary, my words flip
Grab a cemetery and jump in it you jive turkey
Watching me through goggles, I throw hollows at James Worthy
Spin your head like an owl, I'm wild, I drive Fergies
That's that white thing, let my nuts & Mic hang
No one ever knows the drama that I might bring
Chilling with the drama king, but this ain't Broadway, mane
Armed forces, more fortune, alarm Porsches
Bitch gorgeous, bomb head like Civil War and
Y'all snorin', we tourin' and bottle pourin'
Model scorin', cheat the game with fair warnings
One shot kill, one shot kill hey
One shot kill, hey, one shot kill
One shot kill go!
(Pump up the volume)
(Pump up the volume)
I say thinkin' of a master plan
Motherfucker I'm a mastermind, I'm an 18 year old dollar sign
I'm a one man tragedy
I'm Columbine
I'm sharp as fuck but no porcupine
Penitentiary blade to cut yo' ass up
Good lookin hunk
Lookin for anybody thats lookin for me
Shotty look em right in the eye
What do I see
A scared nigga waitin to die
A scared nigga I even got you a suit and tie
Something suitable
Sledge hammer break down your nail cuticles
Nigga I do the unusual
Torture
Any thing is necessary in the art of war
Slam his head inside the suicidal doors
Do him like lil man off players club
Roll around to his knees rub
Shit
Im a ground hog
No Im a young hog
Hoggin up all the money from all a yall
Its funny how all yall wanna be my associates
Come around smile like that shit is appropriate
I'mma put it to your skullcap and open it
Leave it on the side with that ho you was rollin wit
Im rollin with the 9mm close to my nuts and dick
You know who you fuckin with
Im done with regular bowel movements Im on some other shit
Im a fuckin beast you a fuckin bitch
Im a fuck your bitch
Then send her back to you
Let her suck some dick then let her kiss on you
Now ain't that a bitch
That ain't right
But that’s my life
If you don’t like then we gon’ fight
Syke, you gon’ be fightin a bullet
(Pump up the volume)
(Pump up the volume)
Where the pump at
Thinking of a master plan
Mothafucker Im a master mind
Im a 18 year old dollar sign
Im a one man tragedy
Im Columbine
Shit you already know what im about
Keep the guns by the couch in the living room
Company act up we give it to them
Send it to them like emails
Let them sell his soul
Put his body on retail
If we do dirt
And you tell
We gon’ put you under dirt
He was a good person
He was down to earth but now he down to earth
Chillin with the worms and the insects his brother gon’ be next
His mother gon’ be after him kill the family tree
If they fuckin with him and that him is me
And that limb is lost on your body
Aiming at your feet probably
Training day
Sniper music
Sniper music
One shot kill
I told you before
One shot kill
I told you before
One shot kill
I told you before
One shot kill
One shot kill
One shot kill
It was eye witnessing poverty
Burning bullets allowing these walls breaking
Devour these laws trying to empower me
I thought I knew the reason you grew to love sour diesel
Smoking like locomotive your focus was hourly
And then you caught me your pity party had towered me
Shower me with the will that never dried
I tell you put your worries and friendly doubts to the side
I doubt that you listen, it’s stuck in your system I tried
She’s been miserable, she’s been living in prison
Soaking up life’s reality this is the visual
Baby daddy a light build blade walking with highheel
Paid stalking that avenue, never knew how the light feel, I
Got a plan got a plan for ya
I just just might hold a couple bands for ya
And leave this message in the sand for ya
Tell me you’re ready to change
She said naw nigga it’s part of the game
Just like Heroin
I gotta ball for my dead homies
I gotta ball for my dead homies
I count this bread for my dead homies
Smoking dodo in your mama house
She get off work early, cussing at us, and kick us out
Popping wheelies on aqueducts in the summer
We stealing minibikes whistle when Gonzalez was coming
And I remember Shaniqua gave you the cold shoulder
Says she don't fuck with niggas that's chirping on Boost Mobiles
I'm laughing at you and praying that the choppers don't catch you (Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never)
We ditching third period just to fuck your school up
We know where you from homie, uniforms can't fool us
Chalk it up like you s'posed
Cornrows with the zags in the middle
Platinum FUBU jeans, rubber bands wrapped around the denim
I remember...
(Ooh, I remember)
I can feel when you around
You forever hold it down
I return the favor when I'm on stages
In love and memory, no enemy could separate us
And so I gotta say this
How I'm laughing, now I'm crying, I miss you (I miss you)
How I fought you, I hugged you, I remember (Oh, I remember)
I love it even if I get no bigger
You're forever my dawg, my nigga
I'm in this club thinking 'bout my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo-woo-woo-woo
(Woo-woo-woo-woo)
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Pushing foreigns, flying cars
Poppin' trophies, by the mall
Bring back Derek, Stunna Deuce
Pat Dawg that's my cousin, love him too
Wishing I could reverse, us patrolling the turf
Tam's burger for breakfast, chili fries on my shirt
Granny said go to church, how often did we listen?
Sunday school wasn't cool, let's be getting at bitches
Aw man, I got weight on my shoulder
Aw man, I got
Aw man, I got so many angels to feed
Look to the heavens, they depend on me
This personal, I hope you know my loyalty
Will always run deep
So I put it down two times
When I'm on these beats
Put my candle in the street
Put my faith in where you at
Gone, but you're not forgotten
Chad, I promise I'll be back
I'm saying
I'm laughing, I'm crying, I miss you (I miss you)
I fought you, I hugged you, I remember (Ooh, I remember)
I love it even if I get no bigger
You're forever my dawg, my nigga
I'm in this club thinking 'bout my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo-woo-woo-woo
(Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Ba-Ba, bow-bow)
You can't change the world if you can't change yourself (I am)
You can please the world, but not God himself (I am)
You can have the world and still need some help (I am)
You outlast the world, if your heart is real (I am)
You can't change the world if you can't change yourself (I am)
You can please the world, but not God himself (I am)
You can have the world and still need some help (I am)
You outlast the world, if your heart is real (I am)
Uh, I see everybody wanna play gansta now, huh
Well you know what niggas
I'mma just play Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Feel this
Uh, lemme shit on these niggas man
Look homie I'm not your crip or your blood
Homie I'm just Kendrick
See me other than him might plead the fifth amendment
Hard headed nigga shit all it take is an instant
Shocked to have scored just as soft as an infant
Say you bust your gun, but never totin' it
You say your man is dope I think he's smoking it homie
Why you provoking it don't mean to boast a bit
But you can call me a fly cause your boy be on some shit
Pussy fly so all the girlies think I'm the shit
I've got it to spend but still never buy them shit
You better guard your bitch
‘Cause all it takes is a finger to turn her on holmes
Something like a lightswitch
Hands down but still dark think I might switch the Jag for the Porsche
‘Cause it got a better steering grip
Young but been a man and you won't understand
Spree wheels looking like a bed room ceiling fan
When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me
(Nigga) I'm from the land where fiends fly like Peter Pan
And the average man got a heat up in his dickie pants
I got some plans, to stack riches
Own 76′s like a Philadelphian
You don't know but now I'm focused like camera lens
And if I know your mans I might give a second chance
‘Cause I don't wanna hurt you
Have ‘em running in herzels
Shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle
Crack sells, drug sell all in the virtue
Been an artist since Prince played in Color Purple
Weed smoke hydro blow on that purple
2 straps on my side like suspenders on Urkel
I suspend they murk you, what you lying for?
You know you ain't eating like feed the children commercials
Man my children circle around your block
Let out shots and be home 30 minutes before they curfew
When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me
It's real
Kendrick
See me in the streets man
Come to me as a man, man
It's real nigga
Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Niggas respect me man (K. Dot)
Stop being some yank nigga
It's real
Lotta niggas tryna play gangsta, huh
It's 2004 man
You up in this shit quit it
Be yourself man
Still affiliated
Niggas respect me, bitch
Draped in stone like I gazed at Medusa
Download my audio and blow up your computers
Spit that conglomerate shit, the shit that you aren't used to
Shit so strong the unborn can smell it in the future
They'll sell it and they’ll shoot ya
A Mom and Pop store sold out
And the fan killed the clerk over my music
Is that real?
Realer than me at 16, writing sixteens, battled and dismantled six teens
All for the love of hip-hop, I would still rap
Even if Rodman came back and my diss flopped
Thats an analogy built with substance
Fuck an award, my metaphors for the public
I gotta catapult you, bye bye
I wake up in the morning then compose a bar
Flow reckless like the first time you driven a car
Perfected, from years of dedication
Wrote my first 50 songs and then I graduated
With my bachelor's
And if you hearing this verse, I probably got my masters
And by the end of this verse I'm your favorite rapper
Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (ya bish)
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (was persuasive)
From nine to five I know it’s vacant, ya bish (ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (they wasn’t cool)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on ("Let Burn" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (see dollar signs)
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (ya bish)
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (we never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That’s just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That’s just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That’s just how I feel
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (way after school)
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies” (my homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (thinkin’ rational)
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (my Tony head)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (ya bish)
That Louis Burger never be the same (won't be the same)
A Louis belt will never ease that pain (won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (that day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish)
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (a pot of gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel
Uh, What's on a young niggas mind, ya bish? (ya bish)
Benjamins and killin' time ya bish (ya bish)
The quickest way to make the quickest pay (the quickest pay)
Even if it's doing crime, ya bish (ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do)
But for now I guess this sack will do (this sack will do)
They told 'em money the root of all evil (that's all evil)
He hugged the devil the moment he seen 'em
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel
Life in the city, life in the city
Oakland, California, Compton, California
But we survive
Only the strongest survive
Life, life in the city
In the city and nigga's tryna survive
Only the strongest survive
You ever been a victim of being a prisoner inside your own mind?
The bright lights of the street lights will make you go blind
Handicap your senses, you was just an apprentice of watching niggas jump fences
Now you in the Olympics and your hurdle was high enough to clear the tallest of clothes lines
Talented when they closing in on your behind
Life of a young delinquent, even stole him a Lincoln
At fifteen, middle fingers walked out the precinct
I mean the cycle just continue
The vital information and fine print on the menu
So you'll never read it even if a nigga lend you
Money out my own pocket, to make it right
You'll still attend to
Be on them corners with stop signs and a nine
Cause nine times out of ten, MAC 11's cry
And twelve died yesterday and if anyone divides
The six that carried you eventually lose they lives
True story
Come on
Yeah
Punch, what's happening brother?
Niggas be poppin' that shit at me like it's something new to me or something, know what I'm talking about
I tell a nigga quick, that shit just a rerun to me, nigga
I've been doing this shit since Vanguard, brother
And tell me what's happening with it
Niggas hate on me but hop right on my dick as soon as they see me
Soon as they see me, they be like
What up doc
That's what they tell me every second around the clock
Everytime I clock in, rappers checkin' they watch
Studio paid for, hours unlimited
Assholes, how many MC's I knock off they payroll?
How many God MC's I knock off they halo?
Hip-Hop ain’t dead, consumers changed up
Rappers love to see gold like the end of a rainbow
I stay low, like my socks under my ankles
Play the back like a turtle shell, know well
That my team got me if I ever slack on my shit, so if I fall?
Guess what, I don't even trip
It's like that, crushin' little battle raps
Punchlines, I did that in '99, you think it's a gold mine when you think of one
You think you hot, but I think you done
Like Queens, New York slang, look what the killer brung
Machine guns to a fight, fucking right
Pay the bill or I'm turning out your lights, good night
I shatter niggas' dreams, thinkin' they the West Coast kings
Till I drop like visine, tell a nigga quick, it ain't always what it seems
Like the stitching on swap meet jeans
I'm itching to scratch a whack rapper, gun clapper, snuff him like a rude capper
Got a cool bladder, but I'm pissed off, at ya
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me? I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, "Are you not entertained?"
Body any nigga that wanna holla my name
And what, no cut, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up
Nigga said he'd snatch my chain in the streets
What chain? I barely wear jewelry
So I ever had one, you barely seen it on me
And if I ever had a gun, you wouldn't know it was on me
So snatch it and then you're done
I'm in a studio, just sipping on Parmesan
Thinkin' about who could fuck with Kenny and Paula's son
I live this shit, try stop me, you won't live to shit properly
Catch four between your abdomen
Next time you see me, don't ask me who I'm collabin' with
Between me and you, some of the new West is actresses
New hate activists, lowkey can't stand our shit
But still we continue to drink laxatives
Cold blooded, make the label hand me your budget
This is mine don't touch (pow pow), did I stutter?
Catch two, cats knew, I been a gorilla, welcome to the zoo
Yup, you little monkeys know what it do, come test me
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me? I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, "Are you not entertained?"
Body, any nigga that wanna holla my name
And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up
Dayum, you killin' 'em K-Dizzle
And if you don't kill 'em, then you send 'em to hospitals
Sleepin' on a recliner bed, with a thin pillow
I'm with a white bitch, ass like a black widow
Bet I dribble to the end of my lifeline
So when I die, you can say I balled for a long time
The 0-8 Frankenstein, beast like Sasquatch
Feet size thirty-six, steppin' on Hip-Hop 'cause that's my bitch
I write a rhyme, then she ride my dick
The girl is mine, I don't know the ho that you with
You niggas know this, I'm way better than I've ever been
So focused, like a sniper when he zoom in
What's your motive?
I bet it's to go against, like the GT
Get your bitch ass bit, all on these streets
I'm the almighty K, Compton
Rep it 'til my very death day, let the reaper in his face
And recite every song from NWA
I pay homage for those great who paved the way
Wait, back to the subject of who's, and who doesn't do what I do
Bluffin' until I touch 'em like a masseuse do
Nothing compares to me, but the throne, so tell 'em bring the chair to me
I'm a rare bully, small nigga but I handle y'all niggas like I'm eight feet tall
Nigga
Oh, lord, oh, lord
Pretty ass girl over there, come play on ma nappy hair! (*Laugh*)
Drizzy Drake, here we go, look
Bitch, I'm gettin’ it how I live, I put that on my left rib
25 with no kids but this dick you can babysit
25 lighters in the sky, what life is a real nigga
20 Al-Qaeda bomb when I do sight 'fore I kill niggas
Passion my preference, Benjamin Franklin my medicine
The MVP let him in, I'ma fuck up his letterman
Jackets with pendants on them
And I got plenty war story, politic never depended on ’em
Uncle Sam never did shit for me, momma made miracles
Choppers drove me hysterical, cartoons and cereal
Pyramids on Imperial, that's the projects
And I make that progress from a tedious process
I'm a problem better yet a prospect, fuck that I'm a Loch Ness monster
Conquer, Compton, Hail King K-Dot, aka them casings of AK just sprayed your way uh, compensate for shooting for the stars muhafucka, click, brrt
Shooting up the charts, muhfucka
See, a rich nigga will buy anything that you sell 'em
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell 'em
I let smokers pump my gas, but I do that very seldom
Drop your ass at the unemployment, the only way I help 'em
They call me a role model, I'm still a baby myself
Hungover from last night, got to speak at your school at 12
Hennessy with the Sprite had me bouncing like Rumpelstiltskin
They caught me rummaging through women, I’m laughing like Elliott Wilson (*Laugh*)
Pay me respect and pay me on my checks
My first 50 thousand collected paid off some street debts
You know killers that looked out for me back when I was hungry
We go back like Reebok classics and black and blue saucony
I got a genuine clean slate, never you ask for my fucking rate
Never I’m handing out favors, bitch, every show now is 200k
As I write down my new bucket list, I can look down on your fucking hate
Get the fuck up when I'm in your presence, you listen when I fucking say
"What the fuck you niggas want from me? The only nigga that I owe is God!
Huh? Huh? Drizzy
What the fuck these niggas want from me? The only nigga that I owe is God!"
Light an incense for little Kendrick, little, oh, Kendrick
Determination, my drive is like a thousand convertible engines
My adrenaline pump the blood of a warrior, chump, the apprentice
Grown to be a man, 21 now, my heart in my hand
Don’t get gunned down, I’m from Compton, bitch
Fuck a 6-4, we hit the kill switch
The other day I seen my nigga Snows in the casket
Darker skin tone, you can only imagine
The type of shit we on, murdered them dumb bastards
Kill 'em inside their kitchen
And then stuffed them inside their cabinets
Death before dishonor, put that on my mama
I'mma ride till I see the promise land, that’s a promise
Llamas in the unfamiliar minivan
More drama only make more problems, but
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding
Like a black rodeo, .44’s, calicos
Chop 'em up, stop 'em up like a stuffy nose
We supposed to be brothers, motherfuck ya
Tuck your tail, bitch, hell is waiting on ya
While I’m praying on ya
Not on my knees though, I mean preying on ya
I gotta feed, ho, and your death is nutritious to my appetite
After I eat, you’re sure to see afterlife
Jesus Christ, forgive me for my sins
Because when you forgive me, I’m sure to sin again
I guess I’m a sinner, especially when I found out somebody killed my nigga
Nigga, does anybody killer, fuck your creed, race, or color
Son, daughter, sister, mother, brother gotta suffer
Bitch, I’m cold hearted, till my arteries freeze
Please hand me the keys to the G-ride
They outside then
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding
You did me wrong, you put me down
Made me feel low when you're around
And you broke my heart, you broke my heart
My chips went down, it was you I needed
But I was not down, baby, barely breathin'
And you broke my heart
You broke my heart
Livin' a double life, havin' double shots of Patrón
With my mistress 'stead of my wife, I was on
Like the switch in my Marriott, can we get married, Dot?'
I fucked her three times, then I was gone, apparently not
Story of the 80–20 rule is me
Movin' cautiously, parked in the park with my back seat
Way back, her perfume on my white tee
Ignorin' calls from my wifey
See, I was dead wrong, but was tryin' to get a nut
And she had some great dome
Like the New Orleans Saints when they're playin' at home
What's a nigga to think? Oh, just throw away some pussy
Then my conscious called me, 'Pussy'
You don't understand, mama had ass
And I'm quite a butt man, I love my wife, but, man...
I never thought of the day I would quit
Till I opened the door, seen a nigga fuckin' my bitch
You did me wrong, you put me down
Made me feel low when you're around
And you broke my heart, you broke my heart
My chips went down, it was you I needed
But I was not down, baby, barely breathin'
And you broke my heart
You broke my heart
Rare Breed, Kendrick Lamar
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up
Breed up or speed up
This is for my niggas that be all blacked out
Hit the streets a hundred deep, what Rare Breed about?
Riding hard, bending corners, the girlies on us
Leave a hater scarred, big Dressers sit at the stop light
Road Glides and Road Kings deep in my hindsight
You do it right or don't do it at all
Put that candy paint on it, ride them twenty-threes homie
Custom seats, custom brakes, hit the streets and ball
Centre of attention like Bynum and GasolYou know that killer californication
When you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling, chasing
Dreams, hoping this conglomerate can run the nation
It's abomination how we bomb yo' block
I'm talking Big Punch, K-Dub, Baby Slip Billy
Bad Azz, Rare Breed, we all we got
See 'em out, show 'em love, chunk the deuce, give it up
It's a lot of bike clubs but they not this hard, nope
Pounding on the highway stretch
All blacked out, making sure we on deck
Might catch us on them Dressers or them Road Glides, yes
Tell the world I'm a Rare Breed baby
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
Breed up or speed up, I'm a Rare Breed baby
And it's like that to the death though
Two-oh-point and seeing decimals, I ain't lying
Pounding on the interstate in the state that shines
Or we might be in a hood near you
Around the globe baby, Rare Breed under control baby
Them pipes loud, the movement entice crowds
We heat it up in the cold baby
It's three degrees out? Then you should see me out
Or see bout them kitty cats and how they go meow
Ha-ha, we be the father of Harley drivers, so don't bother
Show you infants how to whip it, have a bye-bye
Posers try to hang? Then we hang 'em by the collar
Silk, lannie, Rare Breed family
Stunting hard like a black circus, voila
Breed up or speed up, get ahead
So with that said, bye-bye
Shouting out the one and only Rare Breed
Now Breed up!
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
Meet me at the finish line
40 acres, gimme mine
Revolution televised
Hopin' that you see the signs
Meet me at the finish line
40 acres, gimme mine
Lemonade all the time, keep that in mind
Formation, formation
Exclamation, formation
Fellow great Americans, hello
This is heritage for my medicine
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights aimin' in my direction
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire marshalls and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Obviously guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
Hear me out
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
Take me back to LA
Take me back to LA
Take me back to LA, ohh
I've laughed and I've cried
I've lived and I've died
Stole from, gambled and cheated
Cut corners outside
I've tried and I've failed
Stood tall when they'd run
I've fought a cold war
In the dead of the hot sun
Now take me back to LA
Where the weather is good
Take me back to LA
Don't wanna give the road a second look
And I remember first time that I left
Pain, it flooded the wells of your eyes
You said you'd never forgive me if I didn't make it back
But now I'm comin' home for some good lovin'
I've learned and I've taught
I've gained and I've lost
Made due with what I'm made of
Found out what love cost
Learned who I can't trust
Learned that it's just us
I've learned to love mine
Even when it ain't much
Now take me back to LA
Where the weather is good
Take me back to LA
Don't wanna give the road a second look
And I remember first time that I left
Pain, it flooded the wells of your eyes
You said you'd never forgive me if I didn't make it back
But now I'm comin' home for some good lovin'
Take me back to LA
Take me back to LA
Take me back to LA, ooh
Let’s talk about the street fightin'
We liked it and never lost it
That's gun riots, drive by it with no stalkin'
That shit talkin', pissed off cause we piss poor
Mob pulls bleed see years of war
What you livin for? A couple stolen cars
White T’s, Jordan 4's, ratchet hoodrat broads
A human stash box before they start that martial law
Fuck planet Earth, we killed that turf, they want Mars
Pussy, was fat as mother love
Giving birth to Precious, hell yea I wanna fuck
She took my pacifier and tried to throw up them digits
Opened up my mouth to say she replaced them with sherm stick uh uh
She said you must be wet behind the ears, uh huh
I said I'm blessed my mama wasn’t here
Then we started vibin' and writin' melodies to the sirens
Gun smoke in the air, we stared at the horizon
Hypnotizin', and murder was the case
And every time she wake up, she’s at another wake
Her name is Compton and she need a place to stay
And said if she can live in my heart, she'd play my soul safe
Amen
If I gotta ride
Then you's gonna die
I hope niggas ain't really tryin' to break my bones
Cause if you are make sure you know a nickname you want for that tombstone
Play hard as a rock bullets can break stones
Break bad boys down like Jenny did Sean Combs
I'm hot as an oven you just a pressin' comb
I'm not impressed homes you should've stayed home
And prayed that rooftop blocked you from gettin' shitted on
I gives a fuck if A&R's don't pick up the phone
I swear there's no one like me but if there is then I gotta long lost twin or they made me a clone
I don't care about friends I was made to be on my own
I came in this world by myself and I'm leavin' alone
Hopefully with a crib that I can call my own
With a backyard the size of the fuckin' Georgia Dome
Pop you popped shit and I might pop your dome
Give your homies a reason to make a memory song
Niggas swear that they love when the beef is on
Knowin' that plummet time the only time he'll roam
You better hold your breath I give you workin' death
And recommend the gun be your chaperone
I know young niggas that look up to Al Capone
And they look 17 but I swear that their mind is grown, shit
I'm so grown and the reason why I write this way
Pac and Big be ghostwritin' my songs
You can play the boss but if you get shot
From bein on top then homie that's your loss
I'm nice wit it
I'll pop your man then leave some money on him so it can pay for his funeral costs
The niggas tryin' to get money like Fort Knox
Either from the rap shit or back down to the cut rock
And you can play a baller but deep inside you know you just an actor
Yeah, somethin' like Rick Fox
You ain't a thug homie you just a fox
In the midst of werewolves somewhere in the boondocks
And I'm really from the streets
So if I ask for beef homeboy don't bring me no pork chop
I turn your skin to pork homie with one chop
With a rusty switchblade that's dirty like bum socks
They say the flow is crack
So wherever I rap best believe you can call it a dope spot
I swear
If I gotta ride
Then you's gonna die
K.Dot, you know that he's hot
I can do rhythm, hip hop, I can do pop
We talkin' 'bout the black, we talking 'bout the brown
We talkin' 'bout the white, it don't care who you around
It's all about the positivity when you with energy
If you knew me, then you know that God had witnessed me
If you see me then you know you can't intimidate me or be me
You can see we go for the energy
(K104)
K104
Best hip hop and R&B, I be up in your store
You know I'm rocking out, I got my people around me
We in the building and you know definitely you can't down me
And if the children...
(Dede)
And if the Dede, she called me cute
I walked in the building, I said yo, she got on boots
She got on earrings, maybe baby girl got on hoops
She got that long, brown hair, it's wrapped, yeah, she cute
He say I'm killing this beat, K.Dot he never been weak
You know I got them flows and plus I've always been cheap
And they talk 'bout strip clubs, I talk 'bout ladies and hugs
We talking 'bout more abuse, we talking 'bout these drugs
We talking 'bout my lady to the right, she real fly
Say your name again, girl, don't be shy
(Lady Jade)
Lady Jade, she aways talkin' 'bout gettin' paid
And the haters they in our way and they getting sprayed
Cause the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
They're always gonna play, play, play, play, play
No matter what they say, say, say, say, say
We're getting paid, boss, paid, boss
What's up?
I fall in with an attitude, Billy badass with a back pack full of bad swag
That I picked out I'm a hand it out to, anyone that ever did wrong to me anything that
Did wrong to me I'm a take it back like a vac, you pay tax tonight. Bully!
Run boy
Are you ready
(Kendrick)
Do I look like danger? Do I look like a criminal's anger? Do I look like problem when I tell 'em
That I got 'em? I can even make the famous famous. Pull up, pull up bring it back up rewind
Then I pull out the cups then we pull out the wine
I'm a rebel you a rebel then I'm bout to rock
Climb, I'm a ticking time bomb in California, land mine!
Explode everytime you run, your ligaments stay ahead of me
Everybody say they killing the game, I shoot! and you dead Meat
Wow
I think I must have forgot or something
Like I ain't hot or something
Like I don't make your girl take off her top or something
I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?
Jump in the coup and I'm gone
I smell like money, I don't need no cologne
I just need me a freak
That can jump on the bone
Like an X-Ray technician
My rectangular prism
Says money sex then drugs
All cause I'm 21
Like playing blackjack
Picture this kodak
Moment forever
K.Dot that dude
She sucked my dick and got frostbite
I'm that cool
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?
Bottle of goose and I'm gone
Watching her get loose
Like a third graders tooth
The shit that we on
Is the ultimate high
Double XL flow
That's the ultimate vibe
Park that Lambi' outside
Just to fuck with the haters
Put the Lami' in drive
Watch 'em peel like potatoes
Holla' LMAO
When they drunk and two-step
Like I never could pass
A sobriety test
I'm in the club I can manage
Providing lenses
Make my view panoramic
I'm out of this world
I'm off of this planet
They don't say K.Dot is here
They say his spaceship has landed
And your access has been granted
Like a kitchen floor
But my floor is marble
I ride in the carpool because I got two whores
In the back of that chrome
See they're all I need
Like Aaliyah alone
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)
Look inside my eyes, you can see the universe fly
Deep inside my pupils the aliens camouflaged
Another way to shoot you, my mind is of mass destruction
I'll drop a gallon of Henny in the Big Dipper then dive
Bitches skinny dipping in my orbit
Ever seen a Martian? Gorgeous or some U.F.O. Porsches
I live inside the air plus I wear Air Jordans
So the mic is always near me whether swaggin' or recordin'
Journey on my voyage, you know the sky is the limit
But it's ironic that method never applied to Kendrick
I catapult over your telescope and when I'm finished
I grab the fire that's burning from Mars to light an incense
This rapping's just a metaphor and I deserve a medal for
Writing another metaphor, about ambition
I envision me taking off astronautin' myself
Fuck the world, I'll beat that bitch with the Orion's belt
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)
Staircases take me high (High)
Escalators take me high (High)
Ladders take me high (High)
Elevators take me high (High)
Kids is what make me feel so good
See you looking at the glory that's coming up into the future of life
See the younger youth is what's gonna make everything to keep going
After I done passed down the hill
Young and black!
Then there's a lot of funky things in this country
And there's a lot of good things too
But there's more funky than good
We've changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all
Dude, we got to get our minds together!
Anytime a brother was shot another brother in his own neighborhood
Then go to his funeral and turn over his own casket
They need to have the police down there
Cause see the niggas is N.A.A.C.P
Niggas ain't actin' like colored people
If I can't work and make it, I steal and take it
They come up to me with a nigga who can put air in a bottle and sell it
He can do it man
A nigga can sell anything
As I watch the sky change colors
The rain flooded the neighborhoods of the black brothers
The black mothers are stressing, the coroners have covered
Another statistic, episodes of a cold summer
The street runners got the same legs of Michael Johnson
The fast life surpassed life beyond the conscience
Profanity in the air, the children use the content
The vanity's in the air, that Louis bag: haunted
The black girl with the hair, that's kind of coarse
Her baby daddy's in court, she smoking on a Newport
Seventeen with dreams of becoming a stripper
Or becoming an AIDS victim while touching them zippers
The life that we living in, things we would do just to live again
How can an angel forever live in sin?
You know, anybody that uses somebody else to gain is pimpin'
Well, I tell you what soul brother, lookie here
Can't nobody pimp you but your pimp ass self
You understand?
Then there's a lot of funky things in this country
And there's a lot of good things too
But there's more funky than good
Shit ain't gettin' better
We've changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all
You should already know what I came for
Once the neon light hit the Top Dawg logo
See my, chain hang out
See my, wrists hang out
See my, homies hang out
They, gang bang out
West coast my state, left coast my state, you state myspace, internet gangster
You know my name baby girl no stranger
Blue Bell jeans on low cut taper
No I can't save ya
Name that captain
So awkward when I park it
Rev up your engines, sound like it farting
I'm in the club sitting with some foreign
She don't speak English words sound retarded
We go hard in that project apartment
Five minutes in Watts, get it started
I keep them big ol' 26s on deck
And the bitches they be on it
I keep them big ol' 26's on deck
Stock 'lac gotta fresh paint pussy juice wet
And the bitches they be on it
Oh, man they be so on it, oh, whoa
I got a fast car, Nascar, yes
Two seater, stick shift like some turbo jets
And the bitches they be on it
Oh man, they be so on it, oh
I keep them big ol' 26’s on deck
Stock 'lac gotta fresh paint pussy juice wet
And the bitches they be on it
Oh, man they be so on it, oh, whoa
I got a fast car, Nascar, yes
Two seater, stick shift like some turbo jets
And the bitches they be on it
Oh man, they be so on it, oh
I keep them big ol' 26’s on deck
Stock 'lac, gotta fresh paint pussy-juice wet
And the bitches they be on it
Oh, man they be so on it, oh, whoa
I got a fast car, Nascar, yes, yes
Two seater, stick shift like some turbo jets
And the bitches they be on it
Oh man, they be so on it, oh
I keep them big ol' 26’s on deck
Stock 'lac gotta fresh paint pussy-juice wet
And the bitches they be on it
Oh, man they be so on it, oh, whoa
I got a fast car, Nascar, yes
Two seater, stick shift like some turbo jets
And the bitches they be on it
Oh man, they be so on it, oh
Wait, wait, wait
This song is dedicated to the murderers…
May God judge you accordingly. Good luck with that one…
They all say the average black man only live 'til 25
Pac died at 25
How many kids you know dead at 20? Five?
Now that's life, I know 10 that's crumbling in coffins
Dead as a doorknob
Fresh out of high-school and couldn’t find no job
Went straight to the grave
It’s crazy how the grim reaper in love with such tender age
I think about it as I gaze upon my ceiling
He woke up brushed his teeth then jumped in the shower
Stared at the mirror after he dried his face with a towel
And said, "This can be the day I might pass away
From an altercation my homie got into yesterday
Or mistaken identity, him thinking I was his enemy
When I never seen him a day in my life"
This is life for a young black man
With his future and his burner in his hand
While you’re on your grind, keep this in mind
We say…
Kendrick Lamar, I want to thank you very much for doing this song
It’s Jonathan Emile, 514 stand up
Franco Proietti on the alto saxophone
Jonathan Emile on the beat
This goes out to anybody who has been a victim of abuse of power
Hate, violence. It’s time we stand up
Ferguson aye, to the world. Ahh..
Montréal, New York, ayy
Dem killin’ da people dem
Lyin’ to the people all the time. Ahh..
Inna da streets you see a rainbow
We’re marching for our rights
Tell him I do Deniro, tell him you do Camaro
I do a fast car, something like a Nascar
Move like a sh-sh-sh-shooting star
And they know who we are, big pimping in the building
Got about a million, throw it at the ceiling
Layin smack dead in the face of civilians
Tell 'em I'm chilling with Patron on ice
And my home on ice, and my neck on ice
Lo-lo-lo-look at my ring, I'm a hustler string
You should learn me twice
I'mma grind till I die, that's no lie
Do with my middle finger held up high
Fuck the world, if it fry
I know one thing, I did my job
And that's get what? Move, tell a lie
Sippin on Henny, smokin on ly
Never let a penny pass me by
Move with the Benjis by my side
That's my sidekick, you better watch it
What I mean is, don't touch my pockets
Man big debts, cut them checks
Hundred mill plus, nothing less
Tell 'em I got a couple girls in the Benz, and they extra sexy like ES
PN your boy got game, the magic wanna do the vein
Not ready but I'm way Kendick, so I say F it to all you lames
It's my time, it's my watch, homie
Y'all don't believe me just watch, only
Time will tell but I'll rhyme until I skip time, I'm Michael J. Fox
Got 86 on that dash, got 87 in cash, and I'm born in '88
Born and raised in New York, so you do the math
Pass that dutch, oh
I'mma get a little high now, get a little rush
So I take a little ride to the lower east side, hit the 169
Probably find one girl who was 6'9”
With another girl by the end of the night
I'm her suitor, I can tell the future
I'mma fuck them both at the same damn time
Swallow your pride and then eat a dick
Make the rulers apologize, you ain't ruling shit
I'm Rick Rubin in '85 with the beard thick
Thick bitch type peruvian slanted eyes that squinch
I tell you that I'm one up
Sun down, or sun up
Son, I son niggas
I probably fucked your mama
With no condom
That's good pussy, pussy
Tell it to your honor
This trauma is Jeffery Dahmer
It took me too many moons to fuck up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kick pushed with push brooms
Man look, your man look like sweet water
Cornbread that break under pressure when he's caught up
They call me said I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
I'm just a young boss in the batcave
Back against the wall
I came back with them back pains
Tell 'em put my name on a gym ball
Like I'm Derrick Rose
Ho, know my gym
And players not allowed
I'm spiking your game towel
And spiking your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul
I'm in the crowd like Artest and them
I move the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go and punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not a basket, but rather this good pussy that I'm in
I assassin you niggas
I make your weight shape thin
Blank tapes in your deck
You can still break they necks
They hear it, you need clearance from the label just to spin
I need to clear it with the bank just to spend
Club appearance go for twenty-five racks
When you getting it like that, shit, it gotta be a sin
So Lord forgive me yes I'm a sinner
But these hoes is with me cause I'm a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner
I coached fools to protools to make my agenda
I'm tofu, Im nasty like tofu
I wish a motherfucker would
Get your whole career injured
Nigga, that's assault with a deadly weapon
I killed your favorite rapper
Favorite rapper last record
I fucked your favorite actress on the matress
What a blessing
Make that pussy ante up
She call my dick antidepressant
I'm really not impressed with
None of you niggas stressing
That some of you niggas blessed with
The gift to carry the presence
Picking popping
I'm popping big shit with label investments
Fifteen minutes go for fifty seconds
Last night, I spent twelve hours inside a session
Came up with shit, writer's block
Niggas up in this dressing like
"Who the fuck cares? Who the fuck cares?"
Even when you Slumdog, you'll still be a millionaire
Nigga playing Santa Claus will make sure you hold deer
Have him first put that bitch in a hearse while Rock steer
Church to you pussies
You push me, get pap smeered
Burst out your cookie
I read it, my fortune is here
Look, this be that shit that make real niggas grab they dicks
And bitches rubbing on they tits
Until they fingers monkey wrenched
Monkey see what monkey do
You monkeys never make no sense
Jump up a tree, shit on you
Shitting bricks that can build a castle
No hastle when breaking your picket fence
Know pterodactyls that still exist
And clap you if you resist
Cooperate, go home and seen they daughters copulate
And you at risk
You wear a bracelet, we want your wrist
You can taste it from planet Pluto
Doggone it, you panic just like a poodle
Rip out your culo, then kudos
Two Door regal, El Caminos, and two more
Wipe it off on my shoe, ho
Meant to get smoked then sent off
To Jamaica
No trace of a Laker with Toni Kukoc
Means ain't no hood
Hopping California JACO
Watching Snoop's latest prince get down
Bitch, start popping fireworks
K. Dot
Good morning, America (Ahh)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
The saga continues
Good morning, America (Ahh)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
A new revelation
Good morning, America (Ahh)
Good morning, America
A new day, we gotta hit the schedule ahead of us
The letter K, D-O-T, add a space like a Microsoft keypad
You can't see me, invisible ski mask
Poke the eyes out my beanie
Ghetto Zorro on the headlines, I leave
Feces, shit on niggas, nigga
My flow come in plural
Multiple of it, majority love it
I got the masses, meaning societies, public
Low Dickie shorts, L.A. fashion still holding grudges
Ain't forgot y'all killed Pac, niggas
Ain't forgot y'all left the West Coast for dead
Tried to play it off like the paramedics was coming
Instead, we dusted off, pulled the bullet out our heads
Left a permanent scar for the whole world to recognize
California, economics, pay your taxes bitch
It's a new day
New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
A new West Coast to wake up to, Nate
Good morning, America
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I hope that you're ready
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
A new revelation (The second coming is here)
Show you right
Oh, you done fucked up, baby
Young Kendrick, the grown up baby
On enough to acknowledge your fuck ups
Maybe I spare your life, maybe I won't
Maybe I give you the funk
Geroge Clinton, bring my sentence like I got a English major in it
This is higher academics, pay attention, students
Niggas, what was you foolin' with a handgun?
Might as well have a harpoon, then
I carry two or more with me like I'm carpoolin'
We mile deep when it's beef
I don't say "get 'em," I say "move in"
S.W.A.T team so aggressive, turn a minor problem extreme
Kool-Aid red beam on top of my weapon
Notice my professionalism, I'm perfecting my craft
You niggas is half doin' your job, insubordination
I'mma have the boss get you fired
Oh, I am the boss
Get terminated, bitch
It's a new day
New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
A new West Coast, don't wake up too late
Good morning, America
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I hope that you're ready
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
A new revelation (The second coming is here)
Show you right
The moral is try your best to not collide with the best of 'em
I ain't talkin' 'bout you, I talk about Jay, Nas, and him
Crème de la crème, homie
Pockets fat, hand boney
How is that?
Kinda ironic, the West Coast, I underline it
Make him my priority, in orderly fashion, I ain't livin' in
Nobody lasted in time, nobody closing your blinds
The sun is shining, bitch
It's a new day
New chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, new Doc Dre
A new West Coast, don't wake up too late
Good morning, America
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I hope that you're ready
'Cause as the gold Daytons spin, brings forth new life
A new revelation (The second coming is here)
Show you right
My nigga, hahahaha
Roll your window down, start there
Ahahaha
See, you gotta hear the street
You gotta be snortin', you know
You gotta taste that shit, feel that
Learn that shit, brotha
Learn that shit, that shit will get you killed
These mothafuckas plottin' all kinds of shit behind your back
Shit
These streets is Jurassic, cowards get asthematic
Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere
That's the ghetto bird. Pull up on the curve
"Wassup homie!", smoke a nigga then dip
It's the immaculate, verbal assassin
Strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
This the Jesus of Nazareth
Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown
In a cherry low low, with four zones of weed
No sticks, no seeds
Prestigious when I pulsate the 50 states
My need for speak can corral the largest crowds
Mosh pit, with a big dick screamin' "Bitches ain't shit!"
She gobble gobble for hours, I jumped in the shower
I dismantle, devour hardest Emcees, softer than clam chowder
No challengers can compete, their childish and weak, detrimental
Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein
I'm Corrupted
I'm Corrupted
Gimme a hundred g's, for every emcee I dropped to their knees
Verbally useless
"Oh you got the juice!?" I squeeze you juiceless
Catch you, hang you, from any nooses
Been the truth since "Snoop and Tha Pound" was fuckin over Ruthless
Young and I'm ruthless
21 with 21 guns, shot and saluted for Pac
Lyrical cyclops, lasering in on paper and fraudulent friends
Bitch you's a bitch in disguise, and bitches get ten
Bullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal Injection
In the regal higher than church steeples
I swear to God, can ya lyrics in a jar
I'm a pterodactyl tearin ya squad like pardon
Me and Terrace Martin enacting Martin
Cannibal coexisting with the coldest, that mean I'm the sickest
And Thera-flu won't do, whenever I'm kicking the wickedness
Explosive, cinematic, smoking
Like the barrel of this TEC aimin at ya neck
I'm Corrupted
I'm Corrupted
I'm from C-O-M-P-T-O any nigga can get it
The lil homie strapped and he with it
At the Avalon's swap meet, "wassup fool!?"
Blunt longer than Rosecrans
I grab the devil then slow dance
Practice trigonometry
Practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches
You are counterfeit, worthless piece of verses surf this
West Coast with a big scope kill all yal

Look inside the eyes of a broke nigga
See the stress on his face
Look at his heart, ain't no love in the place
What's on his mind? - murder, money and mayhem
If he don't see a dollar somebody visiting Satan
He grabbed his gat from under the mattress, he cocked it back
Then grabbed his gloves and a mask, then threw on his hat
Looked in the mirror and said, "times is hard"
So hard that he got gray hair on his balls - pause
In the ghetto, you destined to fall
That's why it's a must that we ball
That's why he on the corner lurkin', waitin' for a mothafucka to slip
Soon as he see the chance, he takin' a risk
What should you do, when this nigga snatch you out of your whip
Empty out your pockets then snatch what's on your neck and your wrist---NOTHING!
Cuz when the gat in ya mouth, so speechless
Any false move and ya brains on the CE-ment
It gets gutter, when niggas starvin'
Niggas will run inside ya house, kill you on target--heartless
This is way beyond a cold thriller
This the diary of a broke nigga
PUMP PUMP
Everybody lay down on the ground
Give me whatever you got right now
PUMP PUMP
Everybody lay down on the floor
Give me whatever you got plus more
When times is hard and I'm prayin' for change
My funds is low when I need some change
WOP WOP
Make sure you hide your goods when I come mista
You dealin' with the diary of a broke nigga
It's been a whole month he still ain't see no paper
Nigga losin' weight every time that he wake up
Plus, he tired of askin' niggas for favors
Cuz when they got mad they throw it back in his face
That's foul, flagrant this nigga been slavin'
In the spot all week still ain't see no paper, that's fucked up
They say don't bite the hand that feeds you but if that hand don't feed you where would that leave you?
Now that the stress come
Can't turn back the hands of time
Got him thinkin' back on what he should've done
First thing on his mind now get a gun
Shit you gotta eat, and you got a son
And a daughter, now that's two mouths to feed
And that money seems far like miles to reach
But it's right there
But his brain clouded
Life on the wrong road can't reroute it
Caught the nigga, and showed him what that heater do
If you don't feed your wolves your wolves eat you
This is way beyond a cold thriller
This the diary of a broke nigga
PUMP PUMP
Everybody lay down on the ground
Give me whatever you got right now
PUMP PUMP
Everybody lay down on the floor
Give me whatever you got plus more
When times is hard and I'm prayin' for change
My funds is low when I need some change
WOP WOP
Make sure you hide your goods when I come mista
Ya dealin' with the diary of a broke nigga
When I try to soak it all in, that’s the only thing that kind’ve scare me, feel me? Life is sad in general and I’m meeting these different people every day. It kind’ve snaps me back into reality outside of what I do. Outside of the girls, outside of the cars, the money, it really ain’t that important when you meeting somebody that’s still in the struggle. These the people that live their lives in dark spaces, every day , you know, and they use my music as some sort of tool to keep going, almost like a Bible, you know? These kids feel like they got nothing to believe in but they see me and say, “Kendrick, I believe in you. I believe in your music.” And what happens it puts me in some type of space where it’s almost like some type of worship or responsibility, but I know it. I can see it
Anything I say or do, I don’t take back, I don’t regret.
I think one of my biggest assets is not knowing how famous I am. Or even excluding the word, I hate the word “famous.” I’m aware of it. I know people treat me different because of it. And the more I am aware of that and play into it, the more I become detached from the real world. So it’s really about balance. The more somebody opens the door for me and I walk through without acknowledging that they opened the door for me, the more I become separate from others
I had a talk with Lauryn Hill and she said, “Try to completely throw away your ego.” How many times can you throw away an ego, you know? It’s tough. It’s something we all battle with. I battle with it all the time and the idea of being in all these places—the big spots, all the events, the lights—it’s all for your ego. It’s all for your own confirmation to be like, okay, I’m somebody. But truthfully, you’ve always been somebody. You don’t need the lights
I try to think about that. Also, I like to look at old pictures and think of things from back in the day that kind of draws me back to where I came from. I think a lot of times when artists are in so much of the now, they only think of what’s ahead of them, which is cool. But I look at pictures of the small little apartment that I come from in Compton and things like that. And it always trips me out when I get too far out there where I’m missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me, my moms is and I can’t get back to her. Sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things
It’s definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as I make it. Of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives, and you helped them with their assignment for this and that. And then at the same time, your privacy is not respected. And all entertainers go through it, but moreso the ones that make very personal music, because it’s not just me you’re focusing on now when I’m out in public, but also on individual characters that I’m talking about in my music. So that’s a whole other ballgame and it’s just something that I’ve gotta accept
When I’m completely drained of inspiration, that’s when I’m finished with the project.
I think the way it is, the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect, it’s more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my mom’s van that was on my album cover, that she actually still has. I’d never think that would happen, but it’s happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. She can’t drive that thing no more. And she’s old school, she wanna drive it. But I never want them to be in this type of world, because not everybody can handle it. I think the average person wouldn’t be able to handle the day-to-day. It’s a lot of things you gotta deal with. So me doing that, it’s just a piece of me. I gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it
I’d be lying to you to say I knew good kid, m.A.A.d city would be as successful as it has been. In the beginning I was very doubtful. Once I was done, the jitters hit me so fast. I was so confident in making it, because I was like, “This is it, man. Nobody heard this story and if you heard it, you heard it in bits and pieces but I’m finna put it to you in a whole album—from Compton, from the hood, from the streets—it’s a whole other perspective and light, I’ma go back and do the skits just like how Biggie and Dre and Snoop and ’Pac did it. And I’ma tell my story.” Then I wrapped up with it and said, “Man, what’s on the radio right now? I don’t think they doin’ skits and things like that.” I don’t know if the people are gonna understand what I’m talkin’ about on this album because it’s almost like a puzzle pieced together, and albums ain’t been created like this in a long time. Albums that actually still reach the masses, at least
My whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual massive commercial successful album. This is what you think as a kid. You don’t know nothing about creative process and things like that. So I didn’t know how blessed I was to actually go and make an album that I can create and control 100 percent. When I was done with it, I was like, “Man, these people believe in me like this? They let me just do this whole thing by myself like this? I don’t know. Y’all sure I’m right?”
I was nervous because I didn’t think the people would understand it. And I get a call from Pharrell. He said he had a copy of the album and it’s amazing. And I was like, that call was right on time because that was when I was feeling super insecure about it. Pharrell said, “Never feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this.” This is his words verbatim, he said, “Watch what’s gonna happen.”
I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten.
When I come up to certain artists, artists that I’ve always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn’t the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. I always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money, and things I could do for my family
Because that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods, you was taught that having money was success and that’s all you see, all you know. So once I got the money and everything else that comes with it, I felt like I wasn’t satisfied. I’m looking around like, this is great security, but I don’t even spend it on myself, I spend it on my loved ones. That makes me feel good knowing I can support somebody that’s in need. But at the same time, I’m feeling like, okay, what’s after this? So what I realized was, my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that I looked up to for so many years and knowing that I put in that same dedication and work and them saying, “Thank you.” And them being able to recite them lyrics
I think the first time I played “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe” for Andre 3000 was before it came out. I never share my album while I’m creating. I think that the situation with Andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with Dre and Dre was like, “Play some stuff .” I can’t say no to Dr. Dre. But me creating music, I never really play music for anybody, even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. So along with that, I cut off everything on the radio; I really just duck off from music. Because I’m gonna be influenced and I don’t want to be. That has always been my process. I just feel like, it’s really the only prized possession that I actually can control, you know? It’s selfishness for sure, but it’s my selfishness and I own it
I know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. But with me, personally, I can only speak for myself, this is me. Anything I say or do, I don’t take back, I don’t regret. That’s how I was feeling at the time and that’s how y’all gonna get it, and I own it. Love me or hate me, I own it. It is what it is. And that’s how I look at it
From 13 years old to the time I was 21, I was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. Like a rapper’s rapper, using my tongue as a sword, a fuckin’ barbarian. That’s all it was about, slaying words. So when I turned 21, 22, somewhere around there, I got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper ’cause this is around the same time where cats weren’t putting out mixtapes anymore. They was putting out full bodies of work and wasn’t even signed to a major label. So by that time, that’s when I started developing and actually constructing my music from a writer’s point of view. good kid, m.A.A.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. And that’s how I treat everything. Everything is critical like that from here on out. It’s the art of writing
So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, ‘Who am I? Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What’s my responsibility?'
This is more than just music for me. This is actually a piece of me. I’m obsessed with it. And that’s how I take it. When I make my music, it comes from a genuine space where I’m already spreading myself wide to the world. So during my process in creating it, that time is for me, personally. That’s for my heart, those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. That was my memories. Taking those inspirations and going into that booth, that’s something that I hold dear
When I’m completely drained of inspiration, that’s when I’m finished with the project. When I start maybe trying to tamper with things that I shouldn’t tamper with, I’ve already had done, that’s when I’m done and I know I’ve exhausted inspiration. That comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. I always want to put it down to the last idea, and once I’m drawn away from it, that’s when I say, okay, let’s take all these pieces—they might not even be songs—let’s take these pieces and construct it. So what I want to say, and how I want to execute it becomes clear
It’s the best part because the things that I say on my records—this is another reason why I don’t just play records for people—you won’t necessarily get it until it’s constructed. I know what type of artist I am. I’m not an artist that’s gonna give you a single and say, “This is what my album’s gonna sound like, go sell it.” That’s not me. I’m just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. Everybody has their own niche. With mine, I just own it, and I know that’s exactly what that is. And I wanna keep that lane. I don’t want to jump in somebody else’s lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. So I stay where I feel like I’m inspired
What’s crazy to me is that I feel the same energy now that I felt before my first album. I know there’s lot of pressure for me on this new album but it don’t necessarily scare me. It’s almost confirmation, like, go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. Because I remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: “Dr. Dre had Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, you seen what Eminem did, right? Yeah, uh huh. Kendrick Lamar, he from the West Coast, and Compton, too. Dre from Compton, you see the legacy he left. Yeah, so I hope that album is good. Matter fact, you got the weight on your shoulders right now.”
Thank you for that. Let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my back
I thought I was going to win Best Rap Album at the Grammys. I put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. It didn’t have big No. 1 records on it and there wasn’t really any commercial hits. It was great songs and I think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. So for me, when you’re saying, “rap,” that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. Yep
I found out a lot about myself in these past two years. It’s scary. I know more about myself now than any other point of my life. I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. I was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. And now 15 years later I’m in front of people every day, tens of thousands of people. So that makes me more of a recluse. That makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of L.A. and bounce around different places and things like that
What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place.
So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, “Who am I? Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What’s my responsibility?” It’s a real trippy thing, you feel me? And I think it’s something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. Things change for you with success when you get money. I noticed when people started treating me a little bit different, the people that I cared about the most, my close friends and family. The artist don’t necessarily change, it’s usually the people around them. Their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. You can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you don’t care about them or you don’t fuck with them no more when that’s not the case. You’re just more focused on what you have to do because it’s bigger
The moment I start seeing change in people around me, that’s when I know something is a little bit different. Then there’s tension in the air that I probably can’t necessarily deal with at the moment. ’Cause when the industry don’t understand me, and the business don’t understand me, these are the people I can run to. What happens when I can’t run to them?
Artists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. I’m always paranoid. I’m already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes I may overthink things or think too much. So when you’re put into a space where you feel like you can’t necessarily trust your close ones, that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. Seriously. All you got is you and God at the end of the day
The hard time for me was probably when I was on the road. It’s almost like you go on the road and you’re gone for two years. And this place you’ve known your whole life, these people you’ve known your whole life, everything is different when you come back. And you feel like, damn, your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. That dirty, stinky, smelly tour bus. And that’s one thing, among numerous other things, that have been hard sometimes. To the point where people are pulling for you left and right, where you feel like you don’t have control over your own life. Over your own well-being
What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. And I’ve seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. And I’m saying this right now to let everyone know, it’s real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity
I got my cross-trainers on, motherfucker, I run shit
All I do is rap, make dough for the dumb shit
The return of that 808 trunk hit

Your false prophets will never jump in my pockets
You're poppin' your gums and I'm poppin' your optics
Optimus Prime when I'm done
And the topic of music is me
And the logic is usually
You should stop in and grab a degree
In the science of how to emcee
And I'm watchin' the critics critique
When I'm climbing the valleys and peaks
And aligning myself
While I'm riding Orion's belt
In the street and defiling this beat
As a dead bitch that lay at my feet
This is King shit...
Fuckin' up the premises, I been a dick
Ain't beneficial, I'm 'bout to issue your nemesis
Evacuate the buildin' when I come through
Evaluate your feelin's when I come through
Tire marks and gun smoke stories
OGs reminisce and show glory
He said, "Nigga, I'm hopin' you make a way out
Before I make this Mac-11 do it for me"
I know responsibility weighin' down on my shoulders
Summertime always the coldest
Niggas do you dirty like the projects
25? Then you are the oldest
This is the feelin' you get when you ride
'Til the wheels fall off and there's no mo' drive
I see the fear when I look in your eyes
You should execute or x out and expire
Not wearing two chains but I keep it true
Real niggas wit me, my real bitches too

Small time hustlin, now it's time to do it big
I want it all, fancy cars yea the newest shit
Came a long way ridin round on my Buick shit
Went by any means, who said it best?
Kobe Bryant mind state I'm shootin til I'm accurate
Can't stop it til I'm a couple million strong
Grinding to put my loved ones on in my zone
Not your average rapper, step inside my universe
Far from you average rappers, nothin is by the book
Welcome to Hell's Kitchen, show you just how to cook
This city is full of bishops, putting pressure on rooks
My vision so panoramic my brain on another planet
To reach it you gon' need more than a neurologist
Honestly to be honest, far from lyrical
Gifted with miracles when I rhyme it's a ritual
Spit it it hit you spiritual nigga
I'm planning my day to triumph
All I got is my word and my sword, choppa and bible
I pray, pray a nigga never get in my way
Cause that'll be the moment he make his bed and just lay
And now you see me shinin' perfect timing I'm a Top Dawg
I love this feelin' make a killing when I'm on tour
All my life surrounded by negativity, jealousy
(Through the mist of it all is what they tellin' me)
(Muthafuckas can't rhyme no more, bout crimes no more)

Put you in front of the street then buy you some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, should've worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldn't bare my triumph
I'm a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Swinging swords like I'm sparring with a Spartan
Watch they face drop when the beat drop
I drop a real jewel like a Martin, fool
Me and curtains ballin' like peewee kirkland callin' 'em kirk franklin
Stomp 'em, leave 'em hurting
No judgement for a plaintiff
They tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as O.D.B
But I've been O.D. since '03
That's March 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it like sweet chin
Music on Chuck Norris

My turbulence put a burden on young herbs
Once it's crackin' it's a chain reaction minus Yung Berg
I'm on the verge of excellence kill em off with no evidence
Take a shot at the Excorcist then X em out with these words
Panoramic views be tumblin' out my mind
This ain't 1992 bullets tumblin' out no nines
Big AK's like Alicia Keys abbreviated
And nowadays niggas stand behind em like Clive Davis
Clyde Drexler, before the hood got dribbled niggas right up on the stretcher
An understatement said that K. Lamar was under pressure
Don't press ya luck when I'm pressed for time
Cuz when the press get this verse, their sure to press rewind
The president's prayer can't save us in my cul-de-sac
There's codeine, crack and cognac enough violence to keep the devil smilin' while we whilin' on them corners with them ropes and rats
Nigga build a trap house, hope his homies don't run his trap
See the Feds and tap out that's wrestler shit
Don't rest your case as a gangsta because you wrestled your bitch
We move in silence, like the potato tip when we ridin'
And we ride rotten, 2 choppers found dirty sirens
You ain't been where I been, I know where I'm goin'
And life's a bitch, I know that she hoing
I know what I'm sewing, what I reap
I know that I'm flowing like water from sea or water from creek
And if I don't speak, I know you ain't growin
Cuz I'm a leader, respect it when you see em
Accepted by yo new bitch, yo old bitch and yo BM
Y'all always on that BS and PS I'm takin all fades
I'm takin off first, this G6 is on it's way
Baby, I wanna, I wanna get you to understand
I love you, and I love her too
But that may be too much for you to deal with
So I wrote a song about it, you wanna hear?
Well, here we go
My life is Mardi Gras
And she's the life of the party, y'all
It's like ring around her rosy
When I came around they chose me
And I make 'em feel famous, famous, famous, famous
Winner circle, square don't fit
And I'm caught up in a triangleship
Living life in a triangleship
And I'm caught up in a triangleship
Living life in a triangleship
And I'm caught up in a triangleship
Deep in his love
Not sure if that's what this still is
We used to get away, and love, play
Innocent as kids then
Something else happened
We wanted different things
Days turned to nightmares
And over time things changed
Life is funny that way
Time is money, and my bank statement states that I'm in need of more than
Fuss and fights and making up
And waking up after watching me sleep
Just singing songs about moving on
Cause trust ain't slept here in weeks
So let's leave
We talk about 'til color fades from the leaves and falls again
And winter wind springing up in the same thing
Still here
Summer crystal blue sky clear
We just living on love
From hearts trenched and trembling in fear
Chord one, the free loader
Kendrick Lamar, young nigga
Before I ever wear a chain, I make sure you know my name
I'm the same good kid from the block where you was raised
Didn't have a pot to piss in peeing in your pj's
You see my story is a story untold by the kid from Compton making straight a's for new clothes
Surrounded by bullets from one of my relatives foes
Because he been a killer since he was 12 years old
The price of being guilty by association got me places I ain't ever been
Like in back of the swap meet niggas trynna test my chin
Squaring up like a nerd before summer school begin
Then break when bullets breaks wind
All I wanna do is rap
But it's a wrap
When you living inside of Iraq and
George Bush in the culdesac
You get pushed and you righteous act
It's a murder charge on your back
Can I captivate this captive before you try peel my cap
Can I live
Huh
Kendrick Lamar
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear into how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu, my American tongue was leery
Hopped out the gas station, a homeless man with 100 grand
Who passed me just asked for 10 grand, stressing about dry land
Blue skies, powder blue skies then crack open
Piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it, told him beat it
Contributed money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said "my son, temptation is one thing that I defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothing less, nothing more"
I told him I didn't have it then close my door
Tell me how much how much a dollar costs?
And this a freestyle beginning
And if you know me you know K.Dot TDE winning
We are the champions, we disagree
You can't see it then you best believe
This the cypher, I need y'all to throw some words up
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop
They wanna know the question
K.Dot, everybody stressin'
This is the message that I'm kickin' too wicked, straight from Compton
If you come around my city you'll get stomped in
The neighborhood Watts and Long Beach
Boy, you out of reach
This is TDE, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock
Schoolboy Q, we hot, you not
This a freestyle off the top of the dome
Big Boy city, you know my home
I'mma represent every time I come to the lab
If you wanna see me, homeboy, get the cab
Cause you can't ride with me, you can't see the streets
You can't see us, it's TDE
My homeboy Dave gon' fly you straight in
Sippin' on that juice and gin and that's a classic
Coming straight from Dre and Snoop
If you want us please jump inside the group
Because you don't deserve it if you don't not
This is straight hip hop, this is off the top
And when I rock you feel it
If it's us and then you hear it
Please consider that the best agree
The top number one emcee
Now when I flip it I flip the beat as my enemy
You thought it was taming me, on point like a widow's peak
Deliver the bars that everyone agree
They say the number one emcee, best believe
I love the pianos and I love the flow
I love the snare drum, I love... oh, I can't cuss on radio
Because if I do they just might let me go
I'm side to the best, I ride to the best
I represent the West, please don't try to test
Because you will get disabled
From best of flows I know, you hate it
Everybody wanna rock, but they can't
We drop it off the top of the backboard for real
And that's a swish, that's a net, alley oop
I feel that we are the champions and these Gods'll stomp you
I come through your block and crash everything that you want or put out to
And if you know my flow then you know how it go
If you know Death Row then you know Eazy, then you know Dre
Then you know Snoop and you know we don't play
But anyway I need y'all to flip the beat
Because my words always compete with the best
I said we don't stop, boy, we run hip hop
Boy, we run rap, boy, this is Top Dawg
D-O-T, D-A-W-G, K-D-O-T, C-P-T
L-B-C West, W-A-T-T-S, Jay Rock, he don't play
Niggas and guards, projects
What you want? We can collide anytime with the biceps
But this ain't no strong arm, buddy, this just a freestyle
Off top of the brain, boy, you know I get wild
You know I'm so foul, you know I'm off of the top
You know this hip hop, you know I cropped
The roof from the birth of the Earth
And I've been doing this since church
With the small slacks, with the soft suspender
If you rapping like that, homeboy, we suspend ya
We contenders, we on the top off the map
We on the top off the globe and yeah this real rap
From the bottom of the soil since Adidas and Run DMC
Sprinting like cheetahs, we run this game and beat me
He gon' flip it and please believe
Every 16 bars is like ours
And if you want it then we 'bout to take charge, what's up?
Tonight's the night I jump off my shit
Deep cover on the incognito tip
And every time the words flip the emcees step, but I don't trip
I keep walking, keep pushing and put 'em in a coffin
You often looking for the best, I'm here
We talking, you looking for the stress, you there
Keep walking, you looking for the West, right here
You stalking the flow, you often to know
I want y'all to know been doing this since the days of Death Row and Ruthless
I've been ruthless, the coupe it been roofless
You spit, the words be toothless
But it get like that because you feel it
I got Rikki on my side and she chillin'
Big Boy on my side and he willin'
They say that he writing my bars, forget it
When the dude is coming with a contract
But I said "hold on, let me look at that"
I said "okay, he want this, he wants these points
He want this, but don't smoke any joints
You my lil partna, how old are you on the scene?"
He said "big boy I been a student, about, I'm about sixteen"
I said okay keep going, and then all of a sudden
He started doing uhh, he started doing these shows
And he got poetic, he got energetic
Spotetic, all those -etics
Any more -etics, any more edits
Then o-etics, and then a o-etics
So then I came back and he was still in class
And then I gave em that pass
I said TDE, the real Macoy
Can't forget Jay Rock, can't forget Schoolboy
And so I put the whole crew together, but from the background
Before I got in they had a lack sound
Thuggin' on other planets, pluckin' my black antennas
Listenin' for freelancers that bitted my style in famish
I don't allow the cameras, I don't allow the managers
I just break down the answers and hope humanity handles it
This is no radio fluke, this is me takin' your food
This is you bullied to school, give up your jacket and shoes
This how I practice the rules, this is what happen when dudes
Like Flying Lotus notice the genius they wrote it is rude
You should promote it, I diagnosed it with viruses through
Microphone's hopin' the plug is runnin' inside of Pro Tools
How can I dodge you buffoons?
I could collide a kaleidoscope with the stars and the moon
The moment I morph in my mood
These are the gorgeous'd of tunes
Police reported then tried to sort it with criminal views
This is intentional fuel
For the fireball dragon, fire shots where you wrastlin'
AK over the dash and now vacate with the Jurassics
The jungle, the wicked masses, the saber-tooth eighty proof
On my breath, this the look of death, this ain't auntie's Mercedes Coupe, yes
Buffalo soldiers at war, you shot fast, but that ain't the final score
Buffalo soldiers at war, you shot fast, but that ain't the final score
They felt like they were laying tracks, for the generation to come. I think my mother knew that freedom wouldn't come in her lifetime, just like I know it won't come in mine. It's a matter of, either we stay like this or somebody sacrifice, somebody laying tracks, so we can stay in a 360 degree. Deadly circle, somebody used to break out and risk, you know losing everything and being poor and getting deep down. Cause someone has to do something, had I had a father, had I had some of these opportunities. I would be able to handle my mother more
This is for my everyday young nigga
It don't really matter where you from niggas
Before you leave the house, kiss your moms nigga
Cause you don't know when that day'll come nigga
Cause only Lord knows that I know how you feel
What we gotta do just to live
Is try not to get our cap peeled, try not to get your cap peeled
They say the average black man only lives to 25
Well I made it past that and a nigga still alive
Which means I'm in the red, I'm indebted to death
That's the wages that sin pay, I'm still tracing my steps
Leaving my footprints in the sand, the concrete rose
That grew on infertile land and blossomed to a grown man
My only fear is pops holding moms hand
Dripping tears on my casket, I refuse to let it happen
By any means avoiding the city traffic
Shooters got the green light, they blocking your right of passage
A young kid turned savage, city madness
A picture painted on the street's canvas, excuse my brashness
I'm trying to live to see past this
Staring at the world and my rear view past tense
In no particular fashion, I'm on borrowed time I'mma grind with a passion
Generation to generation to come
They won't come in mind
Sacrifices, sacrifices, sacrifices
Deadly circle, deadly circle
(Yo, George!
They say they want some more!)
Two tears in a bucket I'll cry with ya, huh
But I can never lie with ya
I can never afford not to afford
I can never put my plans to the side with ya
I can never see a red light like a deer with a head light
I freeze up when I re-up
See I really have patience
If you relatin', only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it
The reason why I hate to wait for it?
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intention
They say time heals all
But if I could short cut my success motherfunk all y'all
(Straight up)
Now now you're out of control now baby
I know you're not in love but I can't get enough
Cause when you go down baby, yes I know now baby
Gotta have a glass of hitch with this crazy ass bitch
He's a crazy ass bitch
Fuck that, you fucked up, a fatal attraction, good luck
The way that I'm reacting to your love
Cupid shot twice, you can't duck
Stupid is what stupid does huh
You probably thinkin' I'm tweaking off on a drug huh
You probably thinkin' I'm creeping up on your work place
Tweeterin' when you in the club huh?
Straight like that though
Rain on your parade in Seattle
And your mom complain that I'm an asshole
I'm tryna' put it in your unh (X3)
My little tadpoles
Swim, swim, good, left, stroke, right, stroke
I wish we could elope and remote to Rio
Rewrote my vows, I shall devote
Everything I lose and then gain
All I need is your attention
All I need is your now I would go to war
If them papers said to restrain
Hold up
Lookin' in your window trying to see what I could find
I don't really ask for much all I want is your time
Everything I lose and then gain
All I need is your attention
All I need is your, now I would go to war
If them paper said to restrain
Strain (4x)
Hold up
Yo, Rock - let me get it, let me breathe on it for a minute
Speak for a minute, put my 2 cent in it for a second
Let them get a view of my mind, backpack tucked with a nine
Went to school with it, didn't play with it
Didn't tell nobody it was mine
It was my weapon, had it for protection
I didn't blink, not for a second
Didn't pour my heart and soul to a reverend
They're hypocrite anyway, rather put my full faith in God
Had to stay on my grind something like when I was sumping
Had to maintain my function back against the wall, they fronting
Played the background like a movie extra
Extra activities, no remedy for the crime going on, same old song
Bet ya couldn't make it out here if you wasn't wasn't that strong
Not mentally, but physically, had to get my psychology on
Mama said I gotta come home, but I didn't, stayed out real late
My excuse was ''how we gon' eat if it's no food on the plate?''
Now wait - think back, yeah yeah nigga, far far back
Came from the bottom to the tip top, now tell me how you love that?
You probably thinking I'm aggravated when I say I foresee the future
Minus the white boy on Final Destination
They say it's one Nation under God
But my reality, one person under a gun
And the funny thing
My paper chasing just begun
Still premature and being the black entrepeneur
In this world where we lust for more money, cash and whores
Got me defining life without my high school thesaurus
Blink twice when you see my Porsche headlights
My car is better than yours
I rub it in, like over-the-counter ointment
You're in desperation thinking that you can coexist
With the immortal vocalist, Ford dealerships ain't this focussed
Even when barefooted, the funky rhythm I still kick
Dead presidents is the medicine for my evil heart
More Franks than a ballpark, porcupine sharp
When I dress, when I talk, a dollar bill eject
My conversations about money, what you expect?
Finna diminish any nigga tryna get involved
The fuck they be thinking? Nothing at all
They go against, but still can't float against
No options, flows like a cheese pizza, no topping
Big rig through both lanes, you play possum
You can't see me, flow cleaner than the water made by Fiji
Money clip like feed me, flyer than an airman straight from Tuskegee
Shoot you out the air man, bring your high down
The next morning your hungover from the sober sound
Or the four pound, Soviet Unions in your town
What your homies doin?
Theres some more bullets to go around, now
We can all get paper like Xerox
Or we can just reset Tetris and clear blocks
Or better yet sum us out the money and buy stock
Or call Will to the car dealer and buy the lots
Getting paid period, every hour on the dot
Uh, oh, y'all know what it is
Uh, it's that Compton -ish
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, (yeah)
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, (right)
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, (ad lib)
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, (let's go)
I'm back at it again
My city back at it with ‘em
Back against the wall, K Dot, they tryna pin
But they can fuck with that pen
The shit I write is brighter than blue gems
You better stay in that gym
Exercise your mind till it's strong enough
To fuck with mine
Stick to my roots like Black Thought and 'em
I'm black with thoughts of Einstein
One word describing him, genius
What you know about the city I'm living
With the souls of the dead is livin'
You don't know about our living conditions
We live righteously, we can give a fuck about your opinion
But it's more than just weed and women, gangsters, husslers
Bullet collisions, players , pimps
Who can envision the place where I reside
Where Eazy was pitchin', Dre was 6'4 lifting
NWA had mention, Quik had the turn tables mixin'
The first ones to say fuck the system
I'm tryin to tell you about
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Geah, his own street like concrete
Would best describe fit his gutter
But see I'm what's underneath
A young gun but not like your young Chris and Neef
I'm from the land of organized crime
Disorderly peace
‘Cause nowadays niggas hustle when they order their piece
And worship their gun the same as their religious beliefs
The Compton shares can't forget the police
‘Cause in the hood tellin pigs no more
It be the mark of the beast
And their main aim is just the talk of the streets
But when you see ‘em please be quick on your feet
That they go , watch em!?
Had you for road kill just like a possum
You could contain ‘em
But there's no way that you can stop ‘em
Niggas plant their seeds to be gangstas
Hoping one day they blossom
The same time, hope the system don't lock ‘em
‘Cause Compton raised niggas and bitches we barely got ‘em
Unless you talk about the one with the attitude problem
From Rosecrans to Central, Compton Centennial
We back that's for my people it's official
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
I don't know if he new around here
Ye it's good to know somebody if you're new around here
‘Cause it ain't too safe for you to cruise around here
Niggas stick to your ass like glue around here
Take New Jersey and fit it shit whatever you don't care
It ain't no magic trick if they make your shit disappear
The outcome is severe, and some of this casket will last a day
But I'm amazed cause the young boy been here for years
I seen niggas shed blood blood tears
Hope you not try to plan for the future niggas will mute you
Had your door in the morning wake you up like roosters
Introduce you to rugers
Clock you in like Tap Judah
A nightmare on my street, Fred Krueger where I live
Minus the actress and the producers
Even adolenscence will shoot you over that paper
We get +Vapors+ like Biz Markie but still I'm used to
From Rose crest to central, Compton's Anthemia
We back that's for my people it's official
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
I welcome y'all to boot camp
Training Day
Fasten your seatbelts
Who shot ya, I don't know but you're best to call a doctor
Make sure them rookie medical surgeons can oper-rate on you
Pistol whip break the face on you, shit I does it my way like Sinatra
Let them infrared's Dalmatian dot ya
Scope'll spot ya, move wrong and I got ya
Through my vision like perennial
Creepin' to your house, you hear footsteps slowly as I tippy-toe
The tip I owe is through your window pane, I'm insane
One shot could leave 'em senseless, Marlon Wayans
Psychiatrist can't restrain the mind of a sick patient
Spray everything, not a single bullet wasted
Be patient, you gon' be meeting mad links
Put 'em in the basement
BET, I'm strapped with TNT
Follow rules every morning, this bitch coming with me, ooh
That's what they say when they see me in your coupe
Sunroof, rims spinning like a fucking hoola-hoop
You tried to play big and say "gimmie the loot"
Tables turned, now the people saying "please don't shoot"
Get out the way, label, and try to make it to safety
Cause I doubt that my shit is on safety
Spray niggas, no ifs, ands, buts, or maybes
Ride shotgun, 745 Maybe
That's Maybach for you dumb motherfuckers
I'm wise like my pops but I'm young, motherfucker
I'm the one, motherfucker, bust around hustlers
You want it? They could serve you, butler
Excuse me Ma, I ain't going for your lover
So when I fuck you, the same time I'm like "fuck you"
You're better off looking for your next sucker
Money talks, I thought you heard Chris Tucker
I ball as if I play for the Rucker
Black Widow, keep something under my pillow to buck ya
He talk about it and when the fifth touch ya, no confession, no Usher, for real
Your whole spot is a movie like Blockbuster
If I want you imma bring it to your block, busta
And make it clap, no I'm not spliff star and busta
In fact, my niggas is linemen the way they rush ya
I keep it street from Compton to Russia
Rhyme technique is something like none other
It's warfare, choke if you scared, go buy a flashlight and pray under your covers
I slaughter niggas, one hand bang, Vince Carter niggas
Young boy I'm a father figure to kids who's minds is bigger
And they pops still sprung off the hardest liquor, I'm young
Please move in orderly fashion
For the love of money and crime I got a passion
Blow your body and spine whenever I'm blastin'
Makeover your whole face, you look like a Jackson
Any one, pick one
Aye
I told you we gonna send you niggas to boot camp
Training Day
Fasten your seatbelts
The ride is rough
Lace your boots too
This is practice right here, we do this shit in our sleep
Yeah
Before I commit suicide, lives will be taken
Mmm, real hip-hop, west coast
Yo, yo
Before I commit suicide
I see to it that a million MCs die, lyrical homicide
Walk up on 'em, circle the block
Hit 'em again less than 5 minutes exact, then fleeing the spot
This is Armageddon, two weapons, two palms
Guns drawn, bang! Motherfucker, bang!
One man Vietnam
.45 popper, rhyme like the 9-5 big poppa
On a seven deck yacht, eat lobster with my comrades
Head doctor, knee pads
Gave it to her out of courtesy
Curtains close on that Maybach
Lay back as I hop on my underground shit
Like a subway, derail the track, the real is black
True rhyme sayers, hitmen, crime payers, llama throwers
Hustle in front of corner stores
Street catered, for been living on minimum wages
It's not a threat, I'm doing myself a favor
With suicide
Before I commit suicide
Before I commit suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
I got my mind on the murder and the murder on my mind
You a liar, you and I are not alike
I flow like water, purify mics
Ask Sean Carter, Nasir Jones
Or anyone sitting on the throne
Don't get your career postponed
Women, children, I rode past in traffic
Can't steer, cars crash
I got a death wish, you might be on my guest list
I wrap rappers on stretchers
Guns clap in the direction your sepsis
No matter your gender, not sexist
You MC? You better surrender
I love breakfast, lunch and dinner
Killing these rappers
Sparring in the winter, training in the summer
More practice, let's continue
Doing numbers like an accountant
You wonder like knife, how much money I'm counting
You're damn right, I spit it pretty precise
And whenever the verse is done, means I took me another life
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
(Oh, you motherfuckers think I'm playing, huh? Let me hop on my Daddy Kane shit, jump on my shit, 'Naw mean?)
I delete MCs under concrete
Verbal mass destruction, you want it? Then call me
A killer, I put these rappers on their death bed
One shot to the heart, one more to the head
My rhymes so clever I never fall off
From an industry nigga, they all get hauled off
But not from a sawed-off, but more like an uzi
Spit rap, and these succulent MCs get chewed, B
Money, power, respect, pussy and pistols
Hoes pop pills like it's a modern day ritual
But I don't sweat 'em y'all, I just behead 'em y'all
And leave the party jumping like players of B-ball
The B-board, those will die who decoy
Destroy any rapper thinking he make noise
It's K-Dot, the terminator
Fake rapper rhyme slayer
Those who live now will die later
The suicide
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?

Murder 101, the hottest nigga under the sun
I come from another planet, holdin' that cannon
Best believe I will dump 'til all of you vanish
BLAW one to the throat, you ain't livin' no mo'
Now you know I go, harder than most
I'm on that pimpin' shit, take your bitch, guard your ho
And I don't give a shit, if I hit, long as she blow
Just as much as a ref does a whistle
I got dimes, just multiply two nickles
From Lisa's to Keisha's down to Nicole's
Got they mind fucked up, they'd sell me their soul
Y'all niggas should already know, I got hoes boy
But you already know that, pimpin'
A baller slash killer like O.J. Simpson
Close to the mic like Scottie Pippen
Superglue grip, I ain't ever slippin'
And I move with the coupe through traffic
Real talk, homeboy, not just rappin'
With the tool, mami know that I practice
Cause when I pull it out, I be shootin' it backwards
She like "Damn, how you do that stuff?"
I said "Don't worry, finish suckin' me up", oh fo' sho'
Before I send 'em to the Heaven, let 'em know what's up
Oh yeah, I'm what people need
And I'm out of y'alls speed cause the flow got gas
Yeah, our shit be the bomb
My suggest, you get your pom poms and cheer

Play with me, have them triple beams aimin' at your rear
Honestly, I'm the mothafucka that niggas fear

Fuck a pistol, let them niggas feel the K, man
I'm still gettin' that cake, man
Cause my uncle's still pitchin' rocks like a caveman
You snakes, stay far from my home
Before I play Nelly and get my Desert Eagle on
Aim at your belly 'til you throw up your own shit
Thinkin' you the shit, face in the toilet
You wanna witness the livest nigga existin'
Then come and pay me a visit, you have to pay for admission
I'm on my mission to conquer my competition
My ego bigger than Jay-Z, for sure, not a maybe
I got the streets in a frenzy, dudes in the streets, they commend me
Don't try to creep, I got semis and best believe they will empty
Mix the juice with the Remy got me feelin' so damn tipsy
Just crashed in front of that Bentley, smokin' blunts the bitch with me
She takin' shots in my gymmy, couple back shots I got plenty
Tell her stop, she said gimme, y'all can see that I'm simply
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave

I love money, I love bitches for the lack of better words
Ain't got no time, ain't got no feelings for the lack of better words
I miss your call four time this evening for the lack of better words
The music loud, can't hear it ringing for the lack of better words
But I say my ego gotta yeet for the lack of better words
I can't love you, I love these streets for the lack of better words
But if it's true, you would trust me for better or for worse
I'm selfish, I can't help it, for the lack of better words
Na, na, na, all you do, make excuse
Na, na, na, all you do, is make excuse
(Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy)
I wish a nigga would (ah!)
I wish this nigga (uh!)
I wish a nigga would
I wish this nigga (yeah!)
I wish your mhm-mhm-mhh
I wish this nigga (uh!)
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga (yeah!)
God damn, bitch, hoe, huh
Yeah, woah
I was born on February 24th, 1970
The day I was delivered they said I would build a legacy
Picture me with influence that last generations
I was made out of love to keep you happy and educated
The first three letters of the alphabet my name
I made you laugh, I made you dance, I made you sane
I been around the world and back, you recorded my almanac
So dearly way before the fact me and pops was estranged
My father was a public figure, bigger than life
Lived as a winner, on stages alike
Rivers of people surely united, just to see our bond
Time carried on, that was a common thread
My perfect father had many flaws
Still they moved they legs and shook they heads in unison
He had more children, I was the oldest
We always played with each other 'fore they ruined 'em
He told me his personal secrets, childhood catching on beatings
Sexually touched and abused, never seen life and the schools
The price of being iconic was demonic and screwed
I stood on stage and had to watch my father on the news
Stress on the head of my spirit, I was lost and confused
I knew both sides of the story, but still, I couldn't choose
See, it was more than humiliation and bein' sued
They crucified my affiliation for points to prove
And now my purpose for livin' makes no difference to you
My total existence was for makin' a smiling move
They said that I would live forever
But the moment he died, more accusations arrived
I had to die too
I remember takin' my first breath August 28th, 1963
The whole nation had saved the day, I made it on TV
My come out was a standing ova', the crowd in disbelief
How could a group of words be so great?
Designed to make you think
Races and faces embracin' my conscience in letter form
How gracious was I speakin' on changes once outside the norm?
The person responsible, my creator
He never conformed or used hatred to form as retaliation
Watch him perform with conviction
Two hundred and fifty thousand souls left they homes to listen
I gather his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission
His life became heroic, then tables turned
My creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned
Other women, infidelity stricken, I can't say he was perfect
It made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me
I prayed that I survived in the midst of the controversy
How many lives'll fall on deaf ears if I'm not worthy?
I won't justify his personal problems, that's not my job
I was only born to make sure your children can play outside
And I imagine the other demons he hid before he died
If they came to surface this dream probably won't be alive
Because of you
I was born in paranoia, it's poison for us
We can't create with joyous ambition, we're out of luck
The critics formed a new coalition and huddled up
The non-creators are now elated and out of touch
Why can't you gladly appreciate the influence we give?
Stop starin' at me disgusted, my substance made sure you'd lived
You want the head of the messenger and the history from him
Which eventually takes away from the good you accustom
Think of a life without the likes of imagination that's prosperin'
The bodies that you consider genius, you like to box 'em in
The great debaters and thinkers, that gave you a voice
Why can't you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ?
Because your better judgement will always look down on me
But if I recollect how we connect, you'll account on me
I got a theory that must of y'all won't allow to see
It goes like this, talent doesn't choose morality
See, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart?
If Carl Benz was a racist, would you stop driving cars?
I can't help we jump in these bodies and you called them a god
Just know the Earth is a just rock without the voices of art
Sincerely yours
Yeah
Mhm
Woo woo woo (she got some good head)
Woo woo woo (she got some good head)
Woo woo woo (she got some good head)
Woo woo woo (K-Dot Valentino)
When I get up all in ya
Tell your girlfriend I beat it up
So she can tell her friend I beat it up
So I can get some fame, about my pipe game
And slang my wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee (that’s funny to me)
Like a pornstar
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Now they know who I are
I was in high school
Met this little bad bitch
She had all the Jordan shoes
Hair in a ponytail
Earrings bamboo
I said no disrespect
Girl I want a sample
She said, “You don’t know me yet”
I said, “What that got to do with it”
One week or nine months I’m still gon’ hit it
Now admit it, you’re tempted, temptation is a motherfucker
Now let your guard down
I just wanna fuck you
I’m hard right now
I put that on me
She giggled and said, “I’m full of curiosity"
Well you know curiosity killed the cat
So as we walk home from school show me where you live at
Walked in, put the rubber on, then I killed that
Walked out, she hopped on the phone, girl he did that
Hm hm
Her friend on the other end thinking how she gonna get a piece of him
Preach
When I get up all in ya
Tell your girlfriend I beat it up
So she can tell her friend I beat it up
So I can get some fame, about my pipe game
And slang my wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Like a pornstar
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Now they know who I are
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Here comes a change and another change
And another change and another wave of change
Like a heartbeat coming from another world
Look into the new vision in mind
Kendrick divine intervention, I drop a jewel and the diamonds glisten
Don’t chime in my business you’ll run into atomic collision
You knew my colonic was different
I’m shitting on shit that was shifting your image
I rhyme like a chemist
I rhyme like the Guinness book of records was records I written
I rhyme and you mimic the rhyme that I didn't like when I did it
You bit it
Your bite is so big you need bridges at night, and 9th can admit it
The pint that Hennessy spiked this minute a mic and a menace
And time is dependent on what you pretending to be
Your grind is diminished by me and mine is the menace the preach
I'm findin my soul on this beat definin' my flow
And you know I fold any foe at defeat its 4 in the morning
Formin a George Foreman that's a grill when I speak and I'm on it
Till the mill in the jeep then living orders
I feel like feets of the fortune of gorgeous of bitches I see when recordin sheesh
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off
I slay a nigga with no conscience, I'm so Compton
I know your confidence, you're incompetent, that's a compliment
Any continent, I can construct atomic condiments
I'm not a Communist, rather govern my own accomplishments
Livin' in turmoil boils my temper
Tempurpedic'll burn if you sleep on me, nigga
Jimmy crack corn and Kendrick can crack the horns
Of a dragon and toss 'em inside of a bush full of thorns
Taggin' along, get you thrown on side of your lawn
Throw a molotov, I toss, catch it like a baton, boss
Acquire many choirs for your funeral
Be quiet before I stand over you like a urinal
Mark a bullet wherever your latest rapper tattoo'll go
Your crew'll know I split you 'til you was two adults
Siamese, I sneeze and bless tracks
You a bitch on menopause, I ain't gotta pause that
Bitch
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off
Leave them with poker faces
Red rag, pull it down so they know it's Jayceon
Riding down Wilshire
07 Charger, K&M Filter
My life real like it was directed by Hype Williams
I started off with visions of stacking Benjamins to the ceiling
The more gang banging, the more killing
The more drug dealing
The more cap peeling
On the block, busting shots with my Cali Niggas
We run deep, hit Compton and rally niggas
Hurricane Game, line them up, let me tally niggas
Trouble makers
Call them big guns, rumble makers
Let the thunderquake 'em introduce them to the undertaker
Palm trees
Big sun with the calm breeze
Yes, Southern Cali
Home of the Chuck Taylors, not Bally's
Far from Vegas, but Sin City
Ab-Soul, put me on it, chronic in the air
Catch the vapors
You see I'm from the murderous blocks
Compton, California where you'd rather get caught with your gun on you
See it's as hot as a sauna
And in the winter time, niggas don't walk out without kissing they momma
Don't call them rappers, address them as Bill O'Reilly niggas
But we gon get them and we kill em, address them as some Hally niggas
When ya'll was ditching class over these hoes man
I was at Centennial catching fades over dice games
That's one years ago, 350 days
I am a good dude to work with
Destroy your life or destroy these rap verses
Life's a bitch
So I buy whatever she wants, and hope heaven can be my reimbursement
Milk the game until I see her on the couch roaming this earth surface
At first I was parched, but now I'm the thirstiest
Dehydrated
Hungry, frustrated
Look, I'm shitting on everything moving
This on my chain ain't a label it's a movement
Fuck with caps, it's a nail in the coffin
Look, I shoot arms like heroin addicts
Look, a hater shit get drastic
You my son, they kill me, you end up a bastard. ha
I got the internet going nuts
Bitches hitting me on myspace say they want to suck him up
You want beef? What the fuck is up?
When I spit, the realest will feel something
That's why I stay on the block, I'm still hustling
When you shit on the drop my shit pumping
A spot like a mailbox, it's where the bills come in
Me and Hurricane riding in an S5
Snatch a nigga up, take him for a test drive
Tie the nigga up, show him how the west ride
Where the best was born
Make sure your vest is worn
Cause nigga's will split ya chest when the Tec is drawn
Nigga's will split ya deck, then pull your card
Just try to act hard on the boulevard
You know it's me in the coupe when I'm speeding through
The fiend's say I whip colt like a vehicle
It's three birds, a bitch, brick, and four fifth
With them three, I take over the whole strip
No shit
The skinny nigga is no bitch
Uh...... Yeah.....
Sippin on that Rossi Wine
Puffin turtle feelin fine
Its just me, myself and I
All I need to free my mind
Nigga, nigga (Im Out'chea) nigga, nigga, nigga (Im Out'chea)
In the middle of the Warzone I be on
Sippin on a big bottle of that burgundy
Mutha'fuck yo styrofoam
Big barrel, baritone
And It sound like Barry White
And it boom like an eight-o-eight
Turn yo' ass to a parasite
On the freeway I rock to the snare
Don't get me out my loop my nigga
A bad bitch I ride with a pair
Like the fruit my nigga
The paparazzi gone shoot my nigga
But I don't pay em' no attention, Im a put em' in detention
Head of the class, head in the e-class with the tint missin'
You said, I know that you said
More company? I probably don't need it
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
Talk about goals
Talk about a pen and a pad and the pad of your house
With a permanent flow
Hennessy on the floor looking at a video on the couch
And the couch is cold
And the pouch in your mama pocket got a permanent hole
And your brother pout 'cause he want food on the stove
And a pedestal with a silver spoon, and a big pool
With a big room and a closet, cause it
Hurt when you laughing at his clothes
Looking at him like he ain't shit
Forever living in that commode
Time flies and I watch it tick
Look in the mirror and I gotta take risk
Like blood on the sheet of a suicide note
Tripod then I aim it at your soul
For bright lights
Bite like a alligator when I write
Hungry, come see determination upon me
Come see the visionary in my sight
My life premeditated by ambition
Pistons from my Nikes take off
No assistance, I'm persistent
Adolf, more than I can chew with this thought
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
Let's talk about pressure
Let's talk about depression
Let's talk about desperate
Times
Everyday I'm guessin'
My mind, It'll never end up resting
I climb a ladder every second
I find another mountain top
Another video I watch when that video go off
I jot like Edgar Allen, matter fact a thousand
Soldiers never could war off my talents
I wanna reassure my talents
I wipe my face but never throw my towel in
I'm often prowlin'
The edge of a quantum jump in my head
I'm a monster from anywhere but Earth
And I'm 1 of 1 ever since my birth, I came for some bright lights
Bite like a bear trap when I write
Hungry, gotta chip on my shoulder
I took it off and ate it
I made it a full meal
And I'm still craving, my front teeth
I sink in the rap game
My name will attract fame
My veins got the blood of a king in it
When it pours down, now Snoop's on stage and he say
"Kendrick"
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
You can run, you can hide
But when you are chosen
The walls they close in
Your forefathers look you in your eyes
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
You can run, you can hide
But when you are chosen
The walls they close in
Your forefathers look you in your eyes
You can own this city
You have everything you need
All it takes is all you got
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not
You can own this city
Deep inside you hold the key
While the world is fast asleep
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
Life never did seem like it seen some life in me
Lights in the cloud that read, "Little nigga just use yo head you might can be
Just like Mike on the mic", Jordan
You’re recording more than twice a week
That’s not enough if you’re nice as thee Eminems
You mimic them legends but your work ethic is quite petite
Everything you like somehow retreat
From the page I’m so impatient
Pacin back and forth my sleeping pattern is getting badder than insomniacs
I’m a zombie at the studio, Can you ponder that?
I soon will blow like an arsonist
All I wanna do is be heard uh
All I ever do is strike nerves (Huh!)
A lot of fuck niggas and a lot of fuck bitches
That’s one thing that I observe (Uh!)
Cus when you doin you, everybody seem cool
Til you fuck around, get a blessing
And you look in the mirror, see the same old nigga
But everybody around you stressin'
I ain’t ask nobody for nothing
I went and got it my own nigga it’s nothin
And if you don’t condone or respect that
Then step back off my nuts nigga it’s fuck ya
I got a an appetite for more supper
And I lack advice for these suckers
And I sacrifice what I made, God bless my days while I’m in this circle
Ridin
Down... When You Could Be.. taking me... down!
My woman be trippin sometimes
I remember her strippin off martin and sipping on some of the cheapest of wine
Which way we gone climb? I'm tryna get higher but you desire land mines, Blow Up
Every time I'm, In Clubs tryna network my social
Life like I'm supposed to but I'm wrong
To you I'm very wrong, but you don't get it, and you won't admit it you say I'm like your ex but I think were nothing different
She gave me them digits
But I didn't call, I put that on me
And yo girlfriends, I know they throw salt like Angelina Jolie, now let's see
I'll be gone til Wednesday, gotta show in Portland
Now my baby, say I ain't her baby
But more of an abortion I'm like that's crazy
I bought that Lexo, and sat it on Jordans
Now miss lady, if promoters don't pay me
Then we can't afford it
Forging signatures on fake check
It ain't life if I don't break sweat
To break these mics on every set
It's ironic I'm Tryna stay grounded at the same time still fly these jets
Hello, goodbye marro rodeo
It's funny you had a great, but still you took ungrateful
Chorus
Don’t forget about us, don’t forget about trust
Don’t forget about the kinkiness of playin' with the cuffs on a bedspring
Penetrate the loud screams, echo in the hallway is a must
I could never let go if I wanna whore, duck, away from your anatomy
The agony is such a pain I could never endure even if I had the cure
With the pure, sweet morphine touch, I mean, I cannot deny my demise to lies
That interrupted our future, I mean, if I compromise, will you improvise?
Please don’t pin no lies, I’m used to you forgivin' and then you forget the truth
I promise that I’ll commit, vamoose to all my old ways
I’m done howlin' today, a full moon will never exist, I swear
If I die right before I wake
Cross my heart, then I seal my fate
Life in the dark of the heartless
Looking at the remedy for all this
Everyday they look at you a target
Falling victim, them and
Him and her then this one, insensitivity
Talk bad religion, skin identity
Lack rash decision made by yours
Pack facility with the urban boy
Gun admitted he bear arm
The entity, arm and leg and head made to destroy
80% of the victim was yours
Maybe I get to relive years of war
Look on the corner, we been here before
Look at the momma, you seen tears before?
Pain bright and early
Rain, sleet, hail, snow, worry
More storm barricade the city
Prosecution, unhung jury
These days murder keep 'em busy
Sweet blood flowed on the gurney
Yellow tape tied around the street
Colin Kaepernick was more than worthy
I could reverse the day, reverse the time
Reverse the block, reverse the gun, reverse the shot
Reverse the law, reverse the flaw
That made us all the versions of a danger flock
Reverse the love, reverse the hate
Reverse the hope, reverse the way we playing sin
Reverse the moment, so we can live again
Life and times of the American skin
41 shots
41 shots
41 shots
41 shots
American skin
41 shots
You can get killed just for living in
41 shots
Your American skin
41 shots
Be careful out there, oh baby
41 shots
41 shots
Don't wanna take the ride
41 shots
Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna take the ride
41 shots
Don't wanna take the ride
41 shots
God feel me
God feel me
Ride low
Feel me
Feel me
Weezy-F where you at?
Look, A straight up Compton nigga til Im 6 feet
Like Iverson be
Ride and die for mines
Its just me
No side on mines
Because I don’t need niggas switching sides on mines
Childhood friends become enemies
Don’t pay’em no mind
Do your mind like they did Kennedy's
Closed casket
Ghetto boys world where we make the murder bracket
High shore taxes
High by the dead beat daddy’s and the mama’s who can smoke the rock the fastest
So he tote llamas middle finger to ya
I never fuck hoes with no condom
Not a high school graduate
Hustlin is where his passion is
Hit the blunt then passin it, hit the bottle then passin it
Hit the gas, hit the brake, hoppin out, blastin it
Where da cash, where da safe?
A robbery’s taking place
Give it to him willingly; he’s killing you anyway because it thrills him
You can almost see his adrenaline pumping
Hey young world we are the children
It’s a young boys world out here
We gotta dredge-it up and down these blocks you got to know
It’s a young boys world out here
I swear to god you gotta feel me
Look..standin on the corner with crack rocks and marijuana
Burner glue, dough and I’m duckin police
In California state penitentiary livin
Feelin like the whole fuckin world don’t love him
So fuck yall
Keep thuggin til the casket drops
Gangsta down to the socks
Wankstas betta beware tryin to be what you not
Just look at his position and the city he live in
Bang the hood like a head on car collision
Bang his tool like a mechanic up under the engine
Knocking on they doors telling neighbors mind they business
Cause 9s can finish off any eyewitness
Don’t call the lieutenant miss Parker he meant it
I’m the author of these delinquents that got you timid
See to you he’s a menace but to me these my niggas
I do this shit for my niggas locked up in that system
Jason head hold ya head
Jewel keep written sentences
Maybe these jail sentences nothing but a young boys demise
And a reminder every time you walk outside
Feel Me, feel Me
Real Talk, what's up
Look, my nigga just had a daughter
Only way to feed his daughter
Said he hustlin harder hope no charges get brought up
Tryin to stay out of gunplay so he see her tomorrow
Back inside the gunplay soon as his homies call him
For that mission again on they mission again
Pop another blue pill then feel relentless again
Waking up in cold sweats see the image again
Nightmares of his victims keep on visiting him
Plus his people keep telling him use your common sense
So he tell’em retaliation is commencing
That’s all they know as a Compton kid
Living only for the moment fuck a consequence
His accomplishments lies deep within
The black heart that hoes be hatin violence
Use violence as his defense so in his defense remain militant
I’m the voice of hell that we livin' in
So when the devil got they tongue, I be speakin' for them
I’m the voice of hell that we be livin
So when the devil got they tongue I be speakin for them
Yung boys
It’s a young boy's world out here
I said I'm out here baby I said I’m out here baby
If you livin in this life blessed one day at a time
It's your world young boy you can heal or destroy
Make it wrong or make it right
It's your world you decide
Said it's yours young boy
Said it's yours young boy
Oh oh oh hey hey yaya baby yaya baby

Red and blue flags, yours are like a rainbow, ha

I'm from a small city, no pity shown 'cept hammers thrown
Quickly push back your dome like a hot comb
So swiftly, come get me
If I had every bitch in the world, boy, you still ain't fuckin' with me
I'm 'bout my money strictly, as long as I stack my banks up
I'll have enough Young Bucks to fuck with 50
Now who fuckin' with me? Me and that gun was born siamese twins
So where I move, it's comin' with me
You down right, play with me, think I won't take your life
The scope'll have more dots on you than a website
I'm 'bout my head right and yours left
I swear in the vocal booth is where I'll take my last breath
That's K-Dot, oh you ain't heard? Shit, that boy hot
With dime bitches runnin' on beaches like baywatch
You sit and watch the young child with my money stacks
Add up faster than cell phones on speed dial
For my niggas that hate the fights

Hit my nigga, on his cell, oh little L that’s my brother
Tell me that a female wanna fuck with the K-Dot
Eat it up, then beat it up, my MO baby, may I?
Two times, I do mines, I knew mines, I do fine
I keep bread and croutons, we bust heads then move on
What’s happenin’? I’m bagging through a bitch and gettin' richer
Bought some toys for the kids, bought a chopper for my nigga, yup
And I’m jiggin’ in the function, I throw my arms up with my index finger pumpin’
A brand new dance coming straight up out of Compton
Little K-Dot from the A-block and I’m Rosecrans thuggin’ huh
Ninth grade at Paramount High I was fucking edgy
Socking out any motherfucker that couldn’t stand me
I did my gudda
Never... again
Never go again
Never, never again, again
Never, never again
Shucking and jiving, wastin' my time
And I say never (never) again, we'll never be friends
You can bet your bottom dollar, bet you'll never mistreat my kindness
I say (never), you can pretend
And while I defend every comma that's on this corner
You wanna sleep in designer, don't yah? (Never)
I comprehend and then I resent
The potential bein' together forever, that's what you promised for me (never)
Fuck Mr. Cupid, put that vagina on me
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar, tone what up,check it out
As the day go I let the beat rock
Then put my thoughts inside the cradle, hip hops
God Father plant the seed, you should be my son
And if you niggas hot, I guess I am the sun
I'm a degree away from global warming, this a warning
Shot like I knew Big but I'm enormous
I hear an Instrumental then I turn to Norman
So go tell ‘em I killed it you fucking informant
I’m always performing
Like it’s my last morning
Before I sit with the Lord and see my mother mourning
I’m in the air with it like a new pair of Jordans
Ground level never been important when I walk the earth
Walk to church bishop said he lost his Bible this time
Told me that he need a verse, I blessed him with a couple of lines
Bear hugged a few bears, wrestle with a couple of lions
That’s the imagery I delivery when I fuck a rhyme…
Fuck off, Kendrick Lamar
My city blowin' them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
My city blowin' them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
Don't lie
I know what you dream about at night
With all your might
You carry them inside you all your life
I got the scars of a lion walking through triumph
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
I got the scars of a lion walking through triumph
I got the scars of a lion walking through triumph
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
I got the scars of a lion walking through triumph
(Colin Munroe)
Oh...Oh...Woah...
Oh...Oh...Woah...
Take care
Not to get to much blood in your hair
I take my time
I get to carry these ones on my life
(Colin Munroe)
Oh...Oh...Woah...
Oh...Oh...Woah...
(Ab-Soul)
Uh, I got the scars of a lion walking through fire
To chase and face my desires I'm racing till' I expire
Aspire to be the great
The greatness is within me just pending until its escape
The feeling is splendid it's fibbing and beating the case
But wait there's a splinter in the splendor cause you just Can't
Please everybody and your adversaries want you to break
That's when you look at yourself in the mirror and then you say
It's me myself and I and I'mma try even if they hate
Try offending anything I confront and give my heart to the people
And turn my back on the government put my all in this music
Survival tactics I practice I keep my eye on the Judas
Counterattack with compassion
And Loriana is my angel, yeah Loriana is my angel
Wish I had heaven on earth to personally see your halo
Sick of feeling like God picking on me
Scarring all the stars in my galaxy
Soul!
Tell my mama it's bad karma, I just killed a man
Tell your honor he got to pardon me if I hide my hand
Fuck what you heard, this shit is revolutionary
Fuck what you heard, this is the last illusion, bury
Me with the nerve and ninety-five marksmen
So I can shoot this game until my trigger finger jam
I see red flag, I see blue flag
I pick a color, then make sure I don't give you a pass
You call it gang violence, you call it livin' mad
I called it life, but now I'm like, 'I fuckin' hate it bad'
And so we holler, 'Fuck what you heard
See, we been down for too long
Fuck what you heard, we been tired of doin' wrong
If you got the nerve to man up and kill a man
Then man up double time and shake that adversary's hand, bang
Ah, this for the hatred in you
This is for that place of darkness they have placed into you
This is for the early coffins of those discriminated
Or racially profiled, I can look you in the eye
And make a vow that I'll never make another assumption
That you'll never be nothin' to me, he fin' if you did the opposite
I'll still run with pleasure
Doin' you the favour of cuttin' through the evil
Kendrick Lamar like God-lover of all people, bang
I woke this mornin' undecided
My demons takin' over my life, yeah
Sooner or later it's a family divided
These patterns gettin' hard to hide, yeah
They say I should be satisfied
They tell me I got the world, but that's a lie
I wished the way I feel could be pacified, sometimes
I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Oh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
If I told you I'm 'bout to break would you look at me different?
Character out of place, would I lose your attention?
Let me know your intentions, cause lately I been watchin' everybody
It's apparent that transparency never seen monotony
Got off of tour, lookin' for closure
Mixin' emotion of bein' grateful and feelin' like some of y'all gettin' over
What's a puppet on stage, singin' and dancin' ablaze?
But trading his worth, distorted by the money that's made
A slave with a verse, I feel like Prince Rogers
I feel liberation is free, I feel I should miss the Oscars
Are you celebrating me as the artist or just a profit?
A question I have for the ones around me that's turnin' toxic
My lungs been heavy from all the smokescreen boobytraps
Reminiscin' on what it was, and knowin' that this ain't that
I vision a rock in a hard place
Hope my daughter isn't born with a piece of my heartbreak
You know stress carries on and your kids reap the mistakes that you made
And I admit that I can be dismissive if I can't relate
And I admit that I only commit to start playin' games
And I admit that I'm bad at talkin' myself out of shame
But who's to blame when the crowds stop cheerin' and they passin' dirty looks?
I now understand that I'll never be understood
Isolation didn't work for me (Work for me)
Socializing didn't work for me
Prayed about it, didn't work for me (Work for me)
You can't cure this disease
The pain too traumatic for relief
Pull up the curtains, let the audience see
I wish I was somebody (Somebody else, oh, somebody else, oh)
Anybody but myself (Somebody else, oh)
Oh, I wish I was somebody (Somebody else, oh)
Anybody but myself
Uh, yeah
Ha-ha-ha, ha, uh
I said chilling in my tipi, no Indian but he be
The realest shit, I must admit, I'm basking in my feces
My style is harder, yours is watered down, Fiji
The bible or my CD? Both of them are said to be the
Formula to live your life, or coping with the ills
No time to play kid, I think you needs to chill
Houseparty with killers, pray for it to defill us
Where exes think it's buffy, and chandeliers hang from ceilings
I'm dreaming, I'm scheming to be major
Composer like I'm Mozart, the sequel to Amadeus
Today is, the day I see the sun, ignoring all the rain
The fat lady has sung, octaves as high as planes
Paper by the forest tree, acres of the THC
I don't smoke but homies do, find a cloud then have a seat
Wonder how Meyer Lansky live to see 80
I just wanna see Mercedes give me head in Mercedes
'Knahmean?
And guess what?
I need all of mine's—mo' paper, mo' dough
I need all of mine's—more pussy, more hoes
I-I need all of mine's—and yeah, publishing, can't forget publishing
Nigga
Just ride, don't ask where we going (Ay)
Journey through the sky, cloud nine, no Boeing (Ay)
Baby take your time, I'ma keep it in control and
Give you what you need and give you what you want in life
I need all of mine's
I need all of mine's
I-I need all of mine's
Just ride, don't ask where we going
Journey through the sky, cloud nine, no bowing
Baby take your time, I'ma keep it in control
Give you what you need and give you what you want in life
Bear witness
Watch me get it in like underage club attendants
The roof go back like it's vintage
The young boy's back to burn your village, the fire touching the ceiling burn
What's God willing when HOVA retired?
Now he back, guess he got some competition on his hands
Who is that? I...am...
K-Dot, I'm claustrophobic don't put me in the box with you niggas
You can't categorize me
I'm already convinced that I'm the hottest nigga out
Any comments? I thought so
You niggas is gassed up like ALCO
Scared to play Madden on All-Pro
Step your game up
I'm here to fuck up niggas' barcodes
SoundScan'll never read your albums again (whoo!)
I take 99.9% of your fans
The last one left is your moms (and she even iffy about you...)
Ain't nothing gifted about you
Put a bullet in you, tell a doctor get it up out you
I'm 'bout to, send him right there, he shark food
Piranhas is coming I put beat on you rap dudes
I don't wait on you rap dudes
Nigga NASA couldn't reach my altitude
Sky's the limit, and your body ain't airborne...

Torch in hand, yes, I'm running
I told you Rock, I like red too
But you gotta kill these niggas out the blue

Do 'em like Paul Bunyan, axe about him
We travel like an ant colony, you can't count us
Sip Henny 'til my throat drown
New Benz, No Malice
Count money 'til our hands get calloused
40 caliber in the Cavalier, welcome to Los
Angeles, you might leave with bandages
Real life, no mannequin
You pull out, no panicking, you better shoot
Or have something fall on your rooftop, no raindrops
I'm talking 'bout gold bullets and black suits
No magician, no magic, POOF
Closed casket fatal attraction
Son 3 hit you like John Paxson, I ain't bullshitting
Them veterans been loved 'em
Talk about bars I got a life sentence of 'em
And I'm just like spitting cousin, ciao
No man get the best of him
My real niggas, once again it's on
'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...

Welcome me, come to me now

For ages and now I'm missing
My U.S. love
Yeah the home of the Beyonce's
Or the lease and Alicia Key to my place
Tango a la Congo, per se?
Straight up out the jungle and I"m feeling lonely
I'm going to the land where they got the milkin' honeys
So let's flip a coin, see which city we goin
L.A. or Miami, no matter long as it's sunny
It be cold in New York, I heat it up
Baby, strip, I'm blowing all of my bucks
Forget about Houston dough with the Houston flow
Purple swag and I'm moving slow
Circling a nigga named Prince
Cause he got all them Houston broads
Loving girls in America
I love them girls in America
Me and my driver will march all over your party
We crash up your club and we don't say sorry
We don't play with Arab money, we play with that safari
But you know I am a prince and I give a damn...hardly
We coming for them girls in the cities
You better tuck your girl or she'll come with me
This is Kendrick
I touch every city that I touch down, score
Endzone more
Rozay watch role play, 10-4
Tap that, baby, O.J., oh boy
Magnum glove, I'm sorry judge, but every pretty girl
Wanna fall in love, I'm Akeem, Prince of Zamunda
Shine like a jeweler
One railway from a high beam
They like me too
I am their type: crazy
ATL, NYC, AZ, MIA, LA
They say he turned up, you damn right
She 25, I call her life
I call her sex, you call her wife
And that ain't right, ya hurrd me?
Forgive me lord have mercy!
Crown Victoria need a oil change
But I’m still feeling notorious, word to Biggie's name
Capital K. Dot
Revolutionary
Black stronger than Hancock
Hand on my cock
Fucker
The Los Angeles pitbull causing the racket
Serena Williams couldn’t even seen him in tennis practice
Fuck with the man/wolf reekening your possession
I stare at the moon and then howl no question
Homie!
This is the part where you spaz out
Like if a nigga spit in yo' mouth
Or called your momma a bitch
Now that’s some ignorant shit
I’m a ignorant nigga
Think of Bernie Mac & Richard taking pictures with ya
With the brain of a million geniuses
Fuck you, with a million penises, no homo
Fucking faggot
You sucking dick and I'm laughing to the bank, Bob Saget
Give up the chips and make the life with paralyses, chaos, havoc
Boycott who evers the best, including Khaled
I pray to God you love your success cause when I have it
You’ll never get a piece, I lay careers out in the streets
If a meteorite had hit me, I be good in a week
If a alligator had bit me, I bet he'd break his teeth
It’s Mandatory
It’s Mandatory, my dude
You a square beyond squares like a rubix cube
I would probably kick your ass but my shoes are glued
To the peddle of this vehicular Porsche I move
It’s Mandatory
It’s Mandatory, bear the glory, of a warrior, warriors state out will kill you for me
One man man slaughter tell the world to record me
I don’t care if he’s 7'6, I’ll get to him shortly
Hol' Up!
I got it Ab-Soul let me go sea floor deep
I’m C4
You a fool if you don’t pick up your heat
Then Bonsoir
Bombs away nigga, bon appétit
I’m Rodney King as I endure beat after beat
Week after week, like you & him lifting weights in the streets
I do my thing and take a breather, then come again
Aiming for your temple like a preacher, as I sin
It's Mandatory!
In every inning sure your career's ending
You niggas ain't winning, really you're short winded
The bases is loaded you ever notice
Your spot in your game was took, as I look at your team choking
Sore losers never can play us, a chin bruiser
Send shooters on your block scurting off on a scooter
I'm raising my stock with every hit record, look at my record
Your status will drop soon as they message me in the session
Minor league coaches we feed them bitches to vultures
You posing as a poser, we post your death on a poster
Your highlight is getting closer, to stardom we never start em
We starve em and tire mark em, in the dust so you can watch em
In God trust, I'm probably tied up with a cheerleader
Just your luck you fucked around and let a queer lead ya
Time's up, you play softer than Damien
We aim it at your cranium and leave fragments over the stadium
Fuck Black hippy nigga, I invented the recipe
It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Ab-Soul I guess
Pretty Chick let me see them breast
E.T. OG from the weed clinic (Soulo)
Solo but I'm never alone (that's right)
I stay high and I'm powerful (Soulo)
Westside (easy call) I got three eyes man I see y'all
All I do is kill shit ICU, party with a few girls at USC
It's 82 degrees and my top off
And they top off, I'm getting topped off, Top Dawg
Women, weed, and weather what more can I say
To live and die in LA
Spend a week on Venice beach -
I'm 2Pac and Biggie Smalls
Every morning nigga I get blazed (aye);
Women, weed, and weather nigga if you bored
Come and join the wave (aye);
Girl, what is your name

Cause I killed it, I done drilled it
She said she like it from the back like a real bitch (uh)
She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried
Yo, I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
But when you got the recipe its no surprise
Bad hoes panties get left behind - I want your behind
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather (they come for)

Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be one
To peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone
And pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job

Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
Then it's 82 degrees and my top peeled, off
Jay Rock got the recipe, fly hoes wanna roll I guess (I guess)

Whatever war you bring, just send me to Iraq

You struck by lightning, frightening, gotta be a Heisman
Trophy, low-key, the one and only
Slay a ho, play a ho like a oldie
Yup, and I'm dope like Opie
Um, so I'm out when the police
Come, like a nut, I'm a nut
For the bucks like a shotgun bust, and I bust
Venom inside the brains of young dames
Like Mr. Dash speaking to his kids on Jay-
Z—We runnin' the game

Now everybody knows the name
Oh my, how the times change
Nothing's the same, but still remember why I came
Oh my, how the times change, getting change
Now everybody knows my name
Driving on a freeway full of darkness
It's just me and plus my heart is cold
As an project carpet
You be coughing up commode
Full of shit see I was told
That only real niggas can harvest any future pot of gold
And look at you, I know you starving, see it's burning in your soul
And you look for me to console your emotions
I'm on the road and I'm joking with all my niggas
We laughing at you the feeling of victory is a gig
And I hope they catch you whenever you fall from the pedestal you was on
And don't get me wrong, you was in the zone of a lifetime
But the place you belong is the bottom
That's why I got a bullet for every ego or tuxedo
And some scenos, a combination that we know
Uh, tight rope, but I notice they walk a thin line
From having the disabilities of deaf, dumb and blind
Every time I recline, then remind myself
I would never die with pussy, less it was on my dick, pussy
I remember why we don't fuck with none of these niggas
I remember, I remember why we don't fuck with none of these niggas
I remember oh my, how the times change

That project shit run deep in my veins now
And I can’t help it
Ooh my lord knows that I can’t help it

Swallow your pride and then eat a dick, uh
Make the rulers apologize, you ain’t ruling shit, uh
I’m Rick Rubin in ’85 with the beard thick
Thick bitch, type Peruvian, slanted eyes, that’s quench
They tell you that I’m one-up, from sundown to sunup
Son, I son niggas, I probably fucked your mama
With no condom, that’s good pussy
Pussy, tell it to your honor, this drama is Jeffrey Dahmer
It took me through many moons just to set up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kick-pushed with push brooms
Man, look, your man look like Sweet Water
Cornbread that break under pressure if he caught up
Big homie said “I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ever run my mouth then my legs'll get cut off”

Greyhound not in town, moving them keys
Hoopty or V12, I'm moving them keys
Niggas know me well, can't move me with ease
Go in your pockets at, take all your cheese
That's how I make my profit, rob y'all when 'ya sleep
It's the black Clark Kent, Superman of this rap shit
Play Superman when them gats spit, and them Kryptonite hollowtips
Make you backflip, then chaperone you to a casket
It's real
Goddamn, there's no man like I am that can compose the skills of a genius
I'm not Hip-Hop's future, I'm Hip-Hop's Fred Krueger
A new nightmare, I'm right there
With the head of Lucifer killing you demons
God's children, what can you do to us?
This rap shit ain't new to us
Been real, since Mama was stroller scootin' us
Y'all better get used to us, I'm my own scout nigga
How you recruiting us?
Heh, I call your bluff, they said stop
But then the people said it wasn't enough, nigga
Once again it's on
I'm the youngest in charge, I am not playin'
I fear no man else than God
Scatter your features, give you a face collage
Not one, but two, I face menage
No hands involved, mommy would rather give a mouth massage
General, you can call me the sargeant
$7.45, five percent tip
I know I'm the shit, please hold the applaud
I spent summers writin' rhymes, winters freestylin'
Daydreamin' Gilligan thoughts on an island
I didn't develop, I was born with this talent
Brain swell up, whenever you come to me you were the challenge
I need a way to balance street shit from the rap shit
Stay on my toes, feet grounded to the souls of the dead
But still bulletholes surrounded the arc in my feet to the crown on my head
Preach, listen how I pledge
I've been gettin' this money since you dummies were peein' in bed
To poppin' wheelies on handlebars and pegs
To poppin' Big Willy at the bar with bread
Pause, it's real talk, I know you gotta crawl before you walk
Shit, I decided to jog
I'm ten brains better than y'all
Propane make emergency calls, whenever them boys speak
I fold niggas up, make both of the ends meet
You 'bout to fitness a lyrical fitness
This is what it'd sound like if God spoke over beats
I cash in my rap friends
Peep the way I deliver, make you wanna tell your peeps
I consider that they learn from me
This is volcano hot, fuck a third degree
Burn, You gotta be K-D-O-T
Once again it's on, I am through with niggas
Twin Glocks, it'll shoot niggas
Put you next to a plant, under a root nigga
Hands folded together up in a suit nigga
This what we do nigga, run your mouth, we remote control mute niggas
Matter of fact, I recruit niggas
Keep somethin' on the side, yeah you know that work
One false move, it'll make your whole body jerk
Think before you cross this turf
You'll get turned into ashes, or even laid in the dirt
Too many opinions in the glasshouse
This world full of ego, let me cash out
Weezy Up, K.Dot
The homie K.Dot, he crazy too
Love
I cosign this, shout out to my homie Jay Rock too, he's my nigga too
Your nigga? Shit
You're my homie I'm telling you

Barrel straight through the peephole
Tell your parents that we home
Propaganda that we own
Crime infested, not contested
Block conventions and street zones
My redemption won't be long (woman)
My religion, fear no man (arrested)
Warrior, Conan, oh man (for gettin')
Horror stories and romance (naked)
Devils that like to slow dance
Kettles burnin' with sin in them
Children don't wanna hold hands
Tourists don't wanna visit and purists die in the maulin'
Fire burnin' through skylines
Follow fortune through guidelines
Bloody Jordans and Popeye's
Stolen Porsches and baby abortions at an all-time high
More divorces and child support lawyers, callin' you, "Dada"
Feds tap on your wifi (skrrt)
Meds makin' you crazy, you dip your head in some agua
Hit the dip while you're drinkin' it
Fuck it, flip on the stop sign
Duck a clip in that drive-by
Fuck a bitch in the Honda
Sell a brick to a minor
Makin' wishes for Jannah
Pump your fist up far higher
Reminiscin' bout Zion
Tigers, bears and lions in every jungle that I am
Welcome to America's future, the great ruler (woman)
Public Enemy's first born, ready to shoot you
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click
Ooh, ya'll done stumbled on a fortune
The rebirth of hip hop since they got abortions
And I rock like Mt. Rushmore, grab your thesaurus
So you can find a synonym of a nigga that been gem
Diamond in the rough
Sheriffs wanna see me cuffed like the links of a button up
Book em down! Fuck is up?
Mind of a Vietnam Vet when a nigga rhyme
A nigga shine, like I'm seeing signs in a different light
I'm on my grind, see it right? Real starving artist
Finna blow like a Mario Game cartridge, standing on my own two
Me and Dave like Big and Puff before shiny suits
Welcome to the Compton Zoo, lying with a lion on Rosecrans Avenue
A tiger on Central
Arms so soar beating up these instrumentals Sounwave give me
More, after that find a morgue with a mortice, because we..
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click
Ooh, and I'm back up on my bullshit, shooting to the top with a hollow
Tip full clip
Analogy is like a pit bull on the pulpit, I drool I don't really
Spit, mad dog in this bitch, foaming at the mouth, is you a man or a mouse?
Sipping Mickey's, while you looking like Mickey trapping it out
That's not a diss, that's really a dope line, and in order to see my vision you
Probably would go blind
I'm chilling with a blonde, she dumb as fuck, but she can suck a bowling ball
Through a straw, that make you tell your mom
I'm just a little nigga trying to make my city proud, I used to watch Doug and wear
My cousins hand-me-downs
Now I'm grown up, unemployed, sipping Henny, pissing throuh a cup, and still get
The job done, 2DopeBoyz I said what up, tell your listeners to have some frost
Bitten gloves cause
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week, and the weak good
Riddance, only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Kind like great antiques museums buy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click
And a nigga was built with a steel heart
K. Dot on the beat, everybody said they smell fart
Shit on anybody, I'm a rappin' porta potty
And I probaby gotta dump right now
See my hobby is to murder every rapper on the planet
Make 'em leave the studio in ambulances
With a bandage on their cranium
I'm bangin' them on sight, with the bars of titanium
Brass knuckles, I beat niggas down, who wanna scuffle?
I’m rude like sayin' ‘fuck you’ to your mother for no reason, now that's cold thinkin'
What am I drinkin'?
I do, spiteful shit, shit like fuck your bitch
Record it, then mail it to your residence
Say hello to the unforgiving flow, cold with it
Grab a coke we gon' be here for a minute
I tell every rapper fall back when I see 'em
Or get clapped like a bitch with gonorrhea
Let's lets talk talk bout bout love
Let's lets talk talk bout bout trust
Let's lets talk talk bout bout you
Let's lets talk talk bout bout us
Let's talk about our love
And when it's said and done
Gimme some of you you (4x)
Baby got a nigga feeling like kid again
Make the homie wanna go and have a kid and then
Marry on an island probably on a private boat
Total silence while we gliding on Hawaii's coast
Body of a goddess
Brains of a Harvard student
Her intellect can intercept the brightest star moving
Hear the horns playing?
They playing for that girl
I ain't playing I plan to go around the world
Might settle down
Like fuck bitches
Call the homies up
I'm in love nigga
Can you believe that?
She gonna follow where my lead at high off life quit then relapse
You heat them horns playing?
They playing for that women
She think a nigga on
I think im on to something
Uhh
And so I ask my
How it feel to be with somebody that you define
As the perfect human that shaped under his design
God almighty
Golly you probably over-shadow sunshine
Man I feel sorry
For them hoes thats playing catch up inside the city
Or catching feelings when they hearing that you fucking with me
Or I'm fucking with you, that vise versa
I'm feeling it, you killing it where them big hearses
You hear them horns playing?
They playing for that diva
Im paying for that Rozy, im paying for that refeefa
Cuz this a celebation
Im seranating every occasion now peep my cadance
I break it down love
You break it down love
Then bring it back up
Fuck in front of the mirror break it till we get bad luck
You hear tham horns playing?
They playing for that queen
I think im really on
Cuz she on my team
In the beginning it always good
Until..
God bless America
The home of the brave
Now if we could stay alive
Maybe one day Kendrick
We could stay?
America
God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
Can you help me understand?
I've, I've been here and there and everywhere
Just to find you here
And I see the future
And fear is a leader who leads all the world to its end
America
God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
Can you help me understand?
You, you've been waiting there and everywhere
Just to hear me say
You know the answers to the questions you're too afraid to ask
And time has no mercy
And now is the time to attack before there's nothing left
America
God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
America
God bless you if it's good to you
America, please take my hand
Can you help me understand?
They found me under the sea, with three dollars and sixty cents
So why would it make any sense for me to not make any since
The curly head, black lipped kid
That works at Magic Disk, be on some shit
I take a stand then make you sit
You take a stand, and then you snitch
What part of the game is that huh?
Pardon my frame of mind, but if you get out of line, it'll be a disaster
I take trips and pass out the most
Monumental rapper, don't ever go toe to toe
With those who's over dosing, on the antidote
Effortless I wreck this shit
Ab-Soul-loutly definite
Bet your deficite, that you ain't testing it
I'm excellence on ecstasy
If you can fathom such a combo, off the Humboldt
Smellin' like I'm lightin' a pine cone
Feeling like my mind got caught in a cyclone
I should put a spell on you niggas, like a typo
TaeBeast, TDE, El Campo
Carson, K-I-N-G, Del amo
Uh, sittin' in my homeboy's apartment
In them dirty halls, burner in my dirty draws.... watch it!
For the boys that want it all, just got into altercation at the mall
But niggas know my protocol, ready for my homicide
Put me in a position, to have my finger itchin'
Don't jump up in the game if you ain't ready for the kitchen
Cause best believe the stove hot, cooking up beef up in the box till my time stop
Barb wires and pig cops
Every door get into locks, phone ain't got no dial tone
Look up and the clouds gone, hungry and my childs gone
Solitary mind state, push ups help me stay straight
Noodles help maintain, reading helps me isolate
Troubles help me concentrate, enemies evacuate
Let me hyperventilate
Hoping that my girl'll still be on it and the mother fuckers call me in the mornin'
(Roll it up!)
Fuck that shit, I'mma blow it up
Fuck that shit, I'mma load it up
Dump that clip, like a movie script
Whether blood or crip, I don't give a fuck
I'mma live it up, my time is now
Time and time again, I got that sound
That'll drown, Titanic, in Atlantic's ocean
I'm hoping, that they both go down
Nigga please, nigga hand your bitch your keys
So she can push your humvee, to my place we can smoke your weed
Pray to god that I'm not god, MC bumped in your ipod
Simply I am the CyHi of Centennial High don't give me no tie
I ready made my business mine, dec-i-mals are definite
Deficate on music mates, and bet, I do it delicate-ly
Ignore your celiba-cy and then tell you fuck you
Aye what the fuck you want, my fucking dick, you fucking cunt
Get off my n-u-t, s, he yes, got that unorthodox flow
Niggas is trapped, they don't hold no wraps but they calling 5-0
Smash in a El Dorado, whip it straight, till the fender break
In the middle of the street, where the criminals be
While I blaze this heat from the Tae Beast.... tape
Kendrick Lamar
California economics, killer assignments
School test scores drop, murder rates climbin'
Scarface where you watch, try to reenact
And launched over the balcony, buck shots in our backs
Every day casualties got me losin' my sanity
Cannons be within arm reach, I'm all panicky
Last week I had a run in with my enemy's friend
Shit, finna be dead man quick
Grab the pistola, hollup, complimentary of the cig
But then the boys rolled up, we both admit
Close call, the ghetto is like a quick game of tennis ball
You're probably well preserved until you get served
Through the knowledge I get a few dollars, you gettin' demolished
If you cruise through Compton wearin' red or blue
See colors in these niggas eyes
Is like a favorite color bein' told by the blind, don't really matter
This a little somethin' you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, niggas will ride and smoke you
This a little somethin' you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, niggas will ride and smoke you
Wanna be involved with the underworld dealers
East Coast bodyers, West Coast cap peelers
Wanna be involved with the underworld dealers
East Coast bodyers, West Coast cap peelers
Life is full of up and downs
Twists and turns
But somehow we keep on steppin'
These walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated, every nook and cranny
I mean it's still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around demolition might crush
These walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I rather miss them
I rather call, I rather diss them
I rather fall on you, put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition go crush
And reality is
Sometimes through these ups and downs
You gotta know when to lead or to follow
Keep steppin'
Chi-town
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Build accessories and stash them on the are
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your homie to save you
Homies to say you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
(That sentence so important)
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hour of the morning
About her baby daddy that's currently serving life
How she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she messing with famous rapper
Walls could talk
Livin' in my own world, I could never die
Ambition of a hundred kings livin' in the sky
Nothin' can stop me, no nothin' can stop me
My destiny tellin' me that God got me
Grace in my own greatness and I made this
Pandemonium and victory, I can taste it
Set me free, I wanna be set free
I wanna be remembered in my own legacy
We fight, we cry, we live, we die as kings
We multiply with gold, our hearts will bleed
You recognize this more than just my dream
Once you realize, you'll know what lies beneath
Know what lies beneath, know what lies beneath
Close your eyes and you'll realize you know what lies beneath
Nothin' can stop me, no nothin' can stop me
My destiny tellin' me that God got me
Came from darkness, I made it with sharpness
Back when I said that I tried my hardest
I will not lose, I paid my dues
I failed several times, I tied my shoes
I remember when it all started
On Alondra in that small apartment
Burgundy carpet and SEGA cartridges
Pop a flick and blunt ashes all on the garments
Momma of off wine cooler, Magic Johnson played Jordan
I was only four, but it was like I heard it before
A house party cracking of the music the Doctor recorded
And according to my awareness I was more than coherent
A cold listener, mocking that shit like a parrot
My cousins kicking up dust cripping
The flag, they wear it around their hand like a mitton
Aiming use it for leverage
Shitting on Compton sheriffs like fuck the police
Woofers and gold rollie's
Every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped
Dropped the dub just to hear Doc drop
A jewel for the sake of hip hop
Who ever have thought the moment I see you bullets for Cali love
Fifteen years later you be saving my life, what
You know once upon a time, not long ago
There was a caterpillar that lived life slow
And a couple inches he stood
And he said to the butterfly, "What's good?"
And the butterfly told him one day he gon' make him rich
And then they said something else
I don't remember what they said
But I think it was something like the lines of:
Wesley's Theory:
When I get signed, homie, I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary thing for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat old monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game and a bad thing chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass them all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the Pres with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check hold on
We should've never gave
We should've never gave brothers
Money go back home, money go back home
We should've never gave
We should've never gave brothers, money go back home, money go back home
Momma:
This feeling is unmatched
This feeling is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap
We don't share the same synonym, fall back
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribbling scratching diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
(K.Dot!) Oh, what's going on?
(Something's on my mind) I think something on my mind, too
(I think it's about that time) I think it's about that time
(Put a little pimping in my pocket) Hit me!
King Kunta:
I got a bone to pick, uh
I don't want you monkey-mouth... sitting in my throne again
(Hold up)
I'm mad (he mad!), but I ain't stressing, noo
True friends, one question
Tell me, where you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Tell me where you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam is the power that be, be, be, be, be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
I can dig rappin', wait!
But a rapper with a ghost writer, tell me what happened to you?
(Oh no!)
No, I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of y'all sharing bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell (A two man cell?)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a dumb, dumb baller
Tell me, where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game got the whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Tell me where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams... (What's the yams?)
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor, R.I.P.
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires, hol' up
24/7, 365 days times two, I was contemplating getting on stage
Go back to the hood, see my enemy and say
Tell me, where were you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Tell me where were you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams... (What's the yams?)
(You goat-mouth, mammy f-)
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Body suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
Shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Flag in my city, everybody's screaming "Compton!"
Probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest
Put that on my Mama and my baby boo, too
(Twenty million walkin' out the court building, woo woo!)
u:
Aahh, aahh, aahh!
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't it, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breaking on marble floors
Watching anonymous strangers, telling me that I'm yours
But you ain't it, I'm convinced your tolerance nothing special
What can I blame you for, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister baking
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
What was your influence, where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I tell you, you damn failure — you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you — I don't need you!
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, buck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear
Loving you is complicated, loving you is -mplicated
Loving you is compli-, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you, not loving you, one hundred proof
(I can feel your body recognize that you're ashamed of me)
You're afraid of me
(Yes I hate you too)
Yes I
When you look in my eyes
Tell me there's more inside
Tell me you're feeling high
Tell me you're here tonight
Tell me you hear my pain
Hear my soul, how you feeling?
Now you know
If you see it, if you would, God
Now get the gold, yeah!
Wooh!
Classic, Young Gotti
Gangsta, gangsta
Look, swallow your pride and then eat a dick
Make the Ruler's apologize you ain't ruling the shit
I'm Rick Rubin in 85 with the beard thick
Dick bitch tight the movie and slanted eyes that squinch
I tell you that I'm one up, sun down then sun up
Son, I son niggas I probably fucked up your mama
No condom, it's good pussy
Pussy, tell it to your honor that this trauma is Jeffrey Dahmer
Took me too many moons set up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kicked, pushed with push broom
Man look, your man, look like sweet water
Corn bread to break under pressure if he's caught up
Big homie said I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
I'm just a young boss with a bat cave
Back against the wall closer my back came back with them back pains, whoa
Tell em put my name on the blimp
Ball like I'm Derrick Rose you should know my gym
You playa's not allowed I'm sparking your game towels
And spikn' your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul
I'm in the crowd like Artest and them
I move the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not this basket but rather the good pussy that I'm in
I assassin you niggas I make you wait shake in
Blank tapes in your deck, niggas still break their neck
They hear it you need plans with the label just to spin
I need to clear it with the bank just to win
Club accounts go 15 racks when you wet like that shit
It's gotta be a sin. Hm. so Lord forgive me I'm a sinner
Hm. These hoes squeeze me cause I'm a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner, I coat food and the..tools make my agenda
I show fools I'm nasty like tofu I wish a
Motherfucker would get your whole career injured
This assault what a deadly weapon
Guilt your favourite rapper, favourite rapper last record
We fucked your baby actress on the map just what a blessing
Make that pussy ante up she call my dick anti-depressive
I'm really not depressed with, none of you niggas stressing
That's some of you niggas bless with the gift to carry the presence
A big in Pac and pop with..and with investments
15 minutes come up with 60 seconds
Last month I've been six hours inside of session
Came up with shit writers block niggas up in this stressing
Like who the fuck cares? who the fuck cares? Even if you get drunk up
Still be a millionaire
You could play a Santa Claus and make sure you're the whole dear
Every verse I put that bitch in the hearse, while boy stear
Uh Church to your pussy and push me get pack..
Verse that you cookie I read it my foot is here big boy
Alright
And you don't stop, and it don't stop
And you don't stop
And it don't stop
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop
This be that shit that make real niggas grab they dick
And bitches rubbin' on they tits as if they think this monkeys rich
Monkey see what monkey do, you monkeys never make no tips
Climbup the tree shit on you
Paranoid the shit and bricks that can build the castle
Hastle and breaking your picket fence
I know pterodactyls that still exist
Clappin if you resist to cooperate, go home and see their daughters go..
You at risk if you wear bracelet, we want your wrist
We can taste it from planet pluto
Dog Gonnit you panic just like a poodle rip out your culo then kudos
Two door Regals, El Caminos, and two more
Sevilles with the whitewalls, wipe it off with my shoe ho
I feel you just menthol, meant to get smoked and sent off to your maker
Trace your..with no the ..coach
Mean ain't no hood high up in California and G watches snoops
Ladies press down I bet you dog watchin, west coast what's up?
Gangsta, gangsta you don't stop
And you don't, and you don't and you don't
And you don't, and you don't and you don't

Yeah, ah
1 2, LA what's at it with it
Kendrick Lamar

Going back to L.A. ya'll
Tryin to see what's poppin
You cannot stop me
Jay Rock, SchoolBoy, Top Dog Entertainment
We the best, with the west
Who can blame me
I've been put up on all the OG's
Dre Snoop, Quick Easy E
DJ Quick and now it's me
Then you see game, now we finna change
The whole fucking game smash it know you lames
Compton you should already know the name yeah we pop it
I shout out the whole westside because I got it like that
And if we had it once then we got it right back
And if you ever had it you won't have it no more
And if we see the back though we to the front door
Taking your bread, crucifying everybody off with their head
This is freestyle of the top of the dome
And you know Big Boi that's my home
What's up?
And you do stop, and you do stop, and you do stop
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do stop
I rather die on my mother fucking feet 'fore a nigga live on his knees
Twin Glocks in my palm back against the wall I'm ready for war
My enemies die slow when I ride screaming THUG LIFE pistol in the sky
Remember me as a real nigga when I go
The Hennessy got me riding dirty with my crew, nigga M-O-B
Pussy ass niggas better duck they tails
Niggas can hide when my squad bail nigga we ballin
Alizé and weed keept on callin' gotta get some more
Intoxicated got almost had me falling lemme hit the floor
World Wide MOB figures I bet you all of my niggas ready to die nigga
Can you feel me? World Wide MOB Figure
Don't even wear yo strap if you ain't ready to die nigga
My attitude like fuck it middle finger towards the public
Bringing buckets to all my adversaries and I love it
My momma stress every night telling me to slow down
I said "Momma I'm in too deep ain't no turning back now"
Cause the niggas from the other side they want me dead
Catch me slipping roll up on me put a hole in my head
And the chronic just to got me even more paranoid
Looking out the window if they coming I'm ready for 'em
Just remember 2Pacalypse never ran from 'em
Ran to 'em eyes open with both guns dump'n
And till then tell them mother fuckers to strap up
Guns blazing when they act up
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
So I move way different than I used to
Eyes in back of my head everything bulletproof
Walking out the house cautious
Circle round the block twice before my car park it
My allies despise my success so they got me watching my every step
No exaggeration I know I can feel the reapers breath
Hovering over me like a helicopter or a 747 on autopilot
All of my problems dissolve once I take control of my own destiny
Hop on my murder chart overcome the odds
This goes out to all my dogs
Just holler if you hear me like a charger made by dodge made by dodge
Just ask Pac what it's like to be ready every night
AK-47 by the window aiming at car lights
For Makaveli the Mac is ready to explode
On any mother fucker who curse his soul
Death around the corner
I was eight when I wrote my first rap line down
Shit, I remember, I was right on the couch
Are you feeling me? Back in third grade I was killing it
If y’all don’t get the metaphor, it’s all elementary
Summertime fun, mack daddy at the pool
Wintertime fun, selling candy at the school
Ready for the action, if it happened, I was cool
I ain’t see ‘em, if you do, tell my daddy I’m a fool, Kendrick
Kendrick Lamar, plain old Kendrick the Average Joe
But not the average flow, just willing to make it, ock
That boy’s bacon, he got relations with Satan, Pops
This type of greatness is well-awaiting the fatal shots
Now what you know about them Westside streets?
We was five like deep, rapping the best of Mobb Deep
Rapping my best in my sleep, that’s if I ever slept
Countin’ bars while you countin’ sheep, you lookin’ at the best
God-given, I’m been spitting since Pokémon cards and yo-yos
Sauconies Girbaud jeans, when Wayne made “bling-bling” I was hip-hopping
Makin’ ‘em hop, have a pogo
Let’s get this cream, cold stones
I’m fallin’ off, hold on
When peeling off, BMX bikes
Ducking shots that was barking real DMX-like
A pizza and a cold Sprite
Peace to the world
I close my door and make love to the beat
Then fuck your girl
That was K.Dot then
I give you my album in replacement of Detox
I drop shit with ease to let y’all eavesdrop
On my style, eyes of an owl as they watch
Throw in that towel or get thrown in a ditch
You flow don’t exist, we co-exist with the UFOs
Goddamnit, stranded on planets that you don’t know
The aliens panic, pack they bags, they hit the road
The truth, the phone booth, the greatness take its toll
Change is coming, change is here
Holla if you hear me
In the memory of 2Pac sincerely
Been a G, since standing four feet on the monkey bars
Steal a nigga's box like it was ours
Cars roll up, Nah we don't fold up
We just hold up our guns like championship cigars
Mama hold the porch sipping OE out of a straw
I remember it all, them early Compton days
Shit, I put my all in them high school hallways
Montgomery never saw the dime bags
Finshed my work, finished a sale right before class was over
Now what's over I'm old enough to put the world on my shoulders without a massage
Never came in the truck no more, we back seat
Times is rough, the only time your pledge your allegiance
If you're shot in the heart bleeding
Ouch
It's gutter when the sun come up
When the sun go down
Nothing but tears, no onions
Under the ungodly functions, 187s and robbery will come
Don't go looking for it
Don't look like you hard
You're better off looking foreign, I'm warnin' ya
Before that warm temperature warmin' up
Your blood temperature, that corner filled with coroners
The neighbors is listeners
I'm the future of the new west for you visitors
Never mind them other niggas
I'm talkin' in particular
Just cause you got the flu don't mean you're sick enough
I'm igloo cold with it
If California snows then I did it
The 21st of June I'll make a blizzard
The OG aim they guns at the moon
Bullets break through the atmosphere
Fear no man but God, the God of rap is here
And I can see you scared (whew)
Real gangsters either dead or in jail
And you don't look like a zombie and I don't see no cells
I sink niggas blackships, he won't sail
And his album really ain't shit, he won't sell
And I had that mind state since twelve
No skates on my feet just running the turf for life like football cleats
5 hours asleep, nigga you do the math
That's 19 hours lost, I got insomnia bad
But, I can't complain or happen to think it too much, came passion Albert Einstien gained
Had to hold my stomach for hunger pains over looking ?
This business got too many villians
Superman is back
The cape ain't red, it's black
That's a trench coat
And the note for your information if we was dead this recarnation
Watch your heads
You better duck, run fast from the mania
Don't stare, don't laugh at the media
Brake free, press gas when it enter ya'
Don't let it go bad when he ante up
Highway, get out the way
Black man do your great escape
Pac-man wanna prosecute you
Raise your hand up, and they'll shoot ya'
Face off, face off Adolf Hitler
Grandkids slayed off
Niggas, same rules, same chalk
Different decade, same law
Keep focus, you wanna get caught with your eyes open
You wanna stay clear of the prognosis
Pride provoked him, watch demotion
Watch em' close enough
Don't let the holster break or roast ya'
Rollercoaster ride that bitch
Soon or later sides gon' switch
You know Johnny got that itch
How many more of us gotta see the coroner?
Slain by the same badge, stop, wait, brake, fast!
Was a good student, got all As
So the music that I'm producing is sort of like high grade
You can get so high that
You won't need a pilot
Everytime you listen you're gaining frequent flyer mileage
Politic on project knowledge with street scholars
In need of fatter wallets so they seek dollars
Holla, at the God, inhale, exhale
Then hail the king draped in Pharaoh's bling
Or something like it
Some will like it, others won't
But understand the flow is as smooth as a summer night is
Off the top when I write this
And the plan is to get a girl with the same eyes
As the goddess Isis
Looking for my Nefertiti in the city
Where we substituted hieroglyphics for graffiti
Don't get smacked silly, with ill battle raps
Under pressure niggas twist like sprite bottle caps
Tell Semtex to gather all his effects
Cause this here might get a few bombs from Flex
A few niggas vexed when we on the set
So a few niggas gotta get palms and necks
Cracked, snapple pop, pay attention ahk
Me and Mickey bout to make this Black apple pop
Like Snapple tops
From BK to the City of Angels
City where niggas throw up their hands in angles
To represent their tribes
And other colors, niggas love us
Kiss the mothers, raise the brothers I'll teach you something
You niggas got the game all wrong
You rapping for niggas in all y'all songs
I got songs like "Treat Her Right" unh
Ladies know when I perform, I be the right form
Any blog, website, Tumblr or forum
You're drug trafficking when you post up these poems
Love it or you don't
But yo my lyrics you will quote
You wanna see whats up, get a beat thats tough
I'll eat it up for sure
If you live than I'm liver, if you hot than I'm lava
Burning up, I'm the agua, shut you down when I rise up
Fucking ducking when I come in bucking with something rugged
Niggas can hate it, but as long as the ladies they love it
Check out the ratio at all our shows
I'm the God, I get all the...queens
Kendrick Lamar the modern day Malcolm
Humble and modest but these margins can move a mountain
I moshpit on the beat and leave the mark of a thousand ,Marksmen
Clearing the street and killing rappers with talent, preach
Yes I said talent, Kendrick ain't scared of y'all, can’t even spell competitor
Lord is my witness
I remember asking artists in streets how they did it
The only features I got is was this handsome face I was getting
How ironic, playing Sonic was the shit like a colonic
Now we vomit over these beats while critics pay homage
This is too street like my 23 summers in Compton
I go so deep, like my dick in your bitch hope the condom never do leak
2 seats, one car, all you hear yes daddy and snapped bras
High salary blow jobs, low calorie rap bars not me
My sweet 16 will probably need a school ID
And usually I be, the dominant victor
You know what time it is nigga
Affirmative Action, you fact or you fiction?
I’m a slain cracker from being insane
Pop a vein when I write this shit
I’m think on the shit, I'm vain and I think you’re a bitch
A female poodle under some homo's voodoo, sucking the industry's dick
We catching bodies, shooting dice in the hotel lobby, fuck your security
And that's at the Ritz-Carlton
My impurity's probably your best asset
I spit acid, hit your block and crumble your address
Leaving them stagnant
This is torture when I scorch you, or escort you
Out the building where ex-convicts with all sorts of
Portable handshanks, your man can’t stick to the script with handpaint
Popping your lip then popping the clip then popping your van, wait
We want the peace, but keep a piece
Said I was Malcolm to your belief whats up
It's Mickey
From the depths of the seas
Back to the rap
Mick Factz motherfucker
From the, the, the Black Apple
Where the nightmares reign supreme
Stay ahead never beg cause I aim to please
Brain disease, sick spit flame degrees
That'll make Satan leave 'til his veins will freeze
Museum Mick, international women with high class
Will do E and look at you like I'm gassed
Oxymoron, big dog evict frauds
Slick boss that shop, tags get ripped off
I don't lie about what I cop like Rick Ross
Come to broads I dish off like Chris Paul
Quickdraw McGraw shoot and spit raw
I'm too hot cause I was born with a pitchfork
This kid hard, when I'm pissed off you lift off
These lip gloss ass rappers are so chick soft
Look lil mama, we ain't blood so Crip-walk
We ain't fam, you ain't my man so skip off
You get your Rafer on, I get my paper on
I'm sonning cats, I'm getting my Darth Vader on
Check the program
I'm killing rappers
Barbarian, I'm Conan
You hear the flow man
The best I know with my chest out bro
The Achievement is coming, thats not an Xbox goal
They leave the city behind us
Straight out of Compton
You need a compass to find us
Waters that blue when people called me "your highness"
Prince of Zamunda, you get in tune with the lions
Away from the rumors and those who assume what I am
Parked onto Hollywood to Hawaiian
Bitches I’m in the reach of 90 degree climate
It’s me, beautiful sounds at CCYN’s
Cheer CLK slash G Wagon driving
I’m a L-A-M-B-O hoppin' out, cool on auto pilot
Smooth ass babies' bottoms with Johnson baby powder
Hey coward, suck a big dick with aids on the tip
No homo, y'all just make me sick
I’m ready for war
I got my riffle, my sword
Blueprint mapped out, this is what’s it all about
But for now cop a sweet out in Singapore
Piña colada with umbrella straws I’m telling y’all
This is Big K nigga
Big clip in broad day nigga
Big K, wave it your way nigga
Chillin in my teepee, no indian but he be
The realest shit I must admit I'm baskin in my feces
My style is harder, yours is watered down they call it fiji
The bible or my CD, both of them were said to be the
Formula to live your life, or coping with the ills
No time to play kid, I think you needs to chill
House party with killers, pray for Italy villas
Where accents think it's Buffy and chandeliers hang from ceilings
I'm dreaming, I'm scheming to be major
Compose art like a Mozart, the sequel to Amadeus, today is
The day I see the sun, ignoring all the rain
The fat lady has sung, octaves as high as planes
Paper bout the forest tree, acres of that THC
I don't smoke but homies do, find the cloud and have a seat
And I wonder how ... live to see 80
I just wanna see Mercedes give me head in Mercedes
My turbulence put a burden on young herds
And once it's cracking it's a chain reaction
Minus Young Berg
Killing with no excellence
X-amount with no excellence
To X em out with these words
Panoramic views be tumbling out my mind
No panoramic views, bullets tumbling out no nines
Big AKs like Alicia Keys abbreviated
And nowadays, niggas stand behind em like Clive Davis
Clyde Drexler, before the hook I dribble niggas
On the stretcher. A understatement to say
That K Lamar was under pressure
Don't press your luck when you pressed for time
Cause when the press get this verse
They're sure to press rewind
A president's prayer, can't say what's in my cul de sac
Codeine, crack and codiac
Enough violence to keep the Devil smiling while we
Wyling on the corners with the ? rats
Niggas build a trap house, hope that Gotti
Don't run his trap. See the fans that tap out
That's wrestler shit. Don't rest your case
With the gaze just cause you wrestled your bitch
We catching bodies and catching fades in the hotel lobbies
Fuck the security and that's at the Ritz Carlton
My impurity is probably your best asset
Spit ass, hit your block and chrome and your address
Leave em stagnant
This is torture when I scorch ya
Or escort ya out the building with ex-convicts
And all sorts of criminal handshakes
Your man can't stick to the script
With handpaint. Poppin your lip, then poppin the clip
Then poppin your van, wait
I want the peace. But keep the piece
That I was Malcolm to your belief, wassup
I'm on Union Square
Kendrick Lamar, violin, we take it there
Me and my man, no one compare
That's like two left shoes, you fools
I'm so rude, my flow is so crude
Spit at the mouth, foam and drool
I'm on top of the world, I'm on my pedestal
Looking under your girl's dress - now that's a mess
Lift my flows like I flip your wife
And pass it to Sounwave down the way
You know he's nice
ADHD, producer, recruit ya
To the armies ?
Take a nigga to war
You know how I'm about to settle the score
Kendrick, Ramal spelled backwards
Come and get me, you're nothing but target practice
You're actors, coming at you with my flows
Like acrobatics. You never can stride into Compton
You get stomped on, what is you're talking about?
You don't want none..
See, I'm the man, tell 'em roger that
I got bitches shattering glasses trying to holla back
My pockets fat, if not they getting there
That's VIP, nigga, you'll never get in there
See, I inspire conversation with dollar signs
You either talking money or just remain the mime
She got a fat ass with an amazing mind
That mean great brain
I swear to God every time I pop off that I pop a vein
Now ain't that true love?
I tell her kill Cupid and give my crew love
And you ain't getting it 'til you get in that jew love
I'm talking Seinfeld, Ben Stiller, Wall Street, bank tellers
Tell 'em you couldn't bury with two cups
Papa need his courage or face eternal extortion
I harbor around the orbit on my Darth Vader
You'll see the light saber dropping jewels, Marc Jacobs
You know
I'm whatever the streets made, the saint
The renegade the chain on the timid slaves
The dead on the corner, the van of the coroner
The ambulance first-aid, the criminals crime wave
The dominate at point guard, the drugs on the schoolyard
The kid on the go-cart, the bucket that won't start
The ruckus that won't stop, the city that hate cops
The niggas that's fed up, shoot and shake cops
The obstacle war block, the feeling of victory
The friend, the enemy, the positive energy
The negative force that forces you to sip Hennessy
And sin like a sinner that exempts all sympathy
The churches that God built, the verses that I killed
The curse that the devil gave, the start of the end of days
The happy and afraid, they dap me and give me praise
But we're nothing alike, see I am life, motherfucker
And everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
It's a few things you won't understand
And so I say comprehend the best you can
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
Now you got a body
But what I love most is how you put
Put your lips on top of me
You gots to be the baddest bitch I've ever seen in my life
Wait!
Your girl look better than you
You know what that means, I'm done with you
Bye!
Imma go hard, so fucking hard till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking arm
Whip the wood grain, whip the wood grain till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking palm
Break the blood vessel out their motherfucking eye everytime I ride by and they're looking at the charm
I laugh at em like that, with my seat laid all the, all the way to the back
And the heat lay right, right, right under that
Clap, clap, brr, brr, that's the sound of my gat
That's the sound of a 100 round drum, like a marching band, I'm a stand up guy
I'mma pump my fist, I'mma wave my hand until I get the attention of the president, pussy
Presedential suite, laying in, laying in nothing but money
With a dove skin bitch laying on the side of me
Reminds me of Buffy, please remind me to fuck her after this freestyle
100 carat, nigga I'm the golden child
Full metal jacket, shit, going pow, pow
Blow your brains out, let it hang out, let the neighbors talk about it, then skip trial
Wow, I'm amazed by how you niggas talk about you're married to the game, ain't took a vow
I'll fuck em up, cut em up, shoot em in the foot, or just gun butt em up
Now, I'm on some other shit, we ain't on the same page
You ain't sticking to the script
Let a 100 round clip stick to your lip like Carmex
Shoot up your whip, fuck your tire, leave your car flat
Blood or crip, I don't give a fuck bout none of that
All of y'all can get it, homeboy, it's more than rap
Training Day, I teach you niggas how to rap
I rap like I got angels on my back
God given, I never walk in the booth without the Holy Spirit
I don't write it
Off the top like a psychic
I kick, lyrics like Jet Li
Which produce money to put your boy on the beach
Shit, sand in my feet
Tell me what the fuck you know bout me
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me
My gun got many ways to get you
You get hit with a missile and live, you would need barbed wire to stitch you
This is not fictional, this here is typical
I will bring it to your door if you can't see the visual
Black Manson, won't you ask him
How I have sex with the trigger just to make the barrel orgasm
Remember when it started, nobody protected me
Had to make way for school in the mornin' and niggas sweatin' me
Where you from? Like shit, I'm tired of niggas questionin' me
Now I'm in, I gotta have that thing next to me
Went to my pop's closet
The next day I'm pullin' up my pants, grabbin' my crotch and walkin' awkward
Somethin' pop off, then I have somethin' to spark with
By the bus stop like man I wish somebody'd push me
I'mma let the hawk spit, with a killin' instinct
Like some of these students gonna have an early coffin
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me
Michael Jackson niggas, the fifth'll change your skin tone
They'll prolly chirp silent when your Nextel is off speakerphone
How real is that? Never
Keep your wordplay intact
And 50 couldn't say it better
Can't find you, show me where his mama live at
You a gangsta, I'm not one, but it doesn't mean
By all means, I'm not very able to pump a shotgun
With the MAC or the Ruger, nigga I got options
So while you play possum, I sit and watch 'em
Creepin', Nas got his so you fucked if you don't got one
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard meYou can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me
I don't know about you, but see, baby I'm ruthless
Try to fight me, and see, baby you're useless
Shots from the MAC do more than have you toothless
The sound is exclusive, bang bang bang, boom
I explode like a Vietnam bomb
Hotter than firemans but my hand got a firearm
Fire at your arm, titty, and hands, breakin' your palms
Usin' them to snatch purses the brand of Louis Vuitton
Nigga, what type of shit you on? It's simple mass destruction
Revengeance, tension, you see I've had enough
Did I mention? I sniff you pussy niggas out
The smell that you bring has aroma like an incensce
Play matrix, see if you the one
It's a million ways to die and this here is number one
And that's starin' down a barrel of a gun
After I smack you 'til it's gun powder on your tongue
Cause boy them shells get hotter than the sun
And boy when I spit, please be prepared to run
Boy, don't forget to have a vest when I come
Cause I'll hit your chest and clog up your lungs mothafucka
You can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard meYou can die on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Mama's cry on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
Ride on the strength of my gun, you heard me?
You heard me, you heard me
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you leave 'em what you tell 'em (Bye hater, bye hater)
Kkk Dot bitch
Damn I'm fly, ain't I bitch
Don't tell me, don't smell me
Since you say that I ain't shit
I be with those Benjamins
Like he was my sidekick
We Batman and Robin
Welcome to our private affair
Where, the narrow be right here
Where, the bitches be right here
22 here, you you
Won't you change your life boo
Together we can slide through
Midnight, Murcielago, loud pipes
Make sure that that head right, damn right
I be on that other shit make them want to curse my government
Dayum, hate the game, hate on me
And I'm loving it
I'm bouncing with a couple models sipping on that bubbly
I'm talking 'bout them yellow bottles with that bucket under it
Gone in my fast car
Circle round the block twice
God damn it I'm nice (I know)
And I see a lot of haters in this room
I just look them in they face, then I say what's up to 'em
Pull up in something brand new
Sipping on that goosey goose
I see some haters in this room
So we tell 'em I love you
Pull up in something brand new
Sipping on that goosey goose
We got some haters in this room
What we tell 'em? I love you
You, make, my life complete
I wonder where would I be
If it wasn't for you
Ugh, check out the denim bitch
That with the dictionary can't even pronounce it
Don't worry bout the name
Just know that they cost 3000
Compton, California
Home of them p-public houses
Where the beast live
And you can hear the city growlin'
Maserati prowlin'
Humping on your neighbourhood corner
Mother fucker I'm ballin'
No Motherfuck that I'm stallin' on them
Every time a nigga come through they be mad then a motherfucker
That's when I reached in my bag and I throw more cash like a motherfucker
3 words for them in the club every time I hear them come
Fuck them motherfuckers
Damn right, I could put that on my life
I use their negative energy for my appetite (hungry)
100 horsepower in my car
But I act a donkey
They see me when I see them then I say
What up homie?
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you leave 'em what you tell 'em (Bye hater, bye hater)
Sometimes, I look in the mirror
And ask myself, what I'm scared of
How dare the media portray me this way? I can hear the
Crowds screaming the weirdest of chants
They all in my era or that's an error
Role model, I can't, it's like I'm a parrot
Apparently, I'm marking the dance
I seen done with the devil such a ghetto romance
Time and time again, I find myself
Inside the cerebellum of several felons
Orion's Belt couldn't live in my world
I seen tigers, lions let loose and spooked
I'm next door to Earl
I guess I rely on Jesus to save us
Before our referral to man as my neighbors
Witness ski masks, the masses don't know
I'm packing this four and harassing your ho
My nigga, what it look like?
Niggas hating, bitches hating, babies dying
Bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killing no cure
Oil spilling, turmoil, poverty stricken, police brutality
Kicking ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message
To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map
Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
The governor keeps us starving, these commercials keep us buying
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion
See that's forbidden, we fryin'
My nigga, what it look like?
(That's exactly what Hell look like)
My nigga, what it look like?
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spittin'
Pac is rapping, Gregory tappin, people singing, bells is ringing
Children playing, angels praying, 14 karat golden streets, collard greens
Red wine, potato yams, turkey legs...
My nigga, what it look like?
(I wonder what Heaven looks like)
That’s where you headed boy, to pine oil heaven. I'mma get that gun, and then I'mma get that money. I don’t believe you got it in you, Jake. I'mma go get it right now (gunshot) Oh shit, awwwww you motherfucker! The next one will kill you. Ohh, son of a bitch. You shot me in the ass
I never been a bitch in my life, I never ran from a fight
I was told when niggas bark you should bite
And these puppies ain’t eatin' enough Pedigree to scare something
They play with the word gangster til some lead dumpin
Until the ambulance coming pressin' on they chest
Calf and stomach, you grabbin' the hand of a woman
I never took the stand, snitched on my man and came back home Like it was nothin', actin' like I ain’t do somethin' wrong
Fuck it, and if I did i would look 'em in the face
Tell hop out that bucket and spray
Tell 'em to make sure they hit my head and my waist
Tell them to circle round the block twice in case
Shit, cement pump in my veins, hard body to the death
Scream fuck the world with a capital F
Everybody extinct, it’s just me and my niggas left
And this is how we think
No tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Tell em'
No teddy bear niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
And when I say hard body, homie, not in a physical
You either born with it or real niggas around real kids
And it’s passed on like a ritual, not sworn in it
You ain’t livin' it because you put it in sentences
And you ain’t givin' it if it’s ten percent, it gotta be a hundred
Walkin' down the block, K in my hands, fuck it, who want it?
I got a hundred shots for any one of you blood clots
Motherfucker, we will fuck ya
Spray your coupe and leave smoke in it like Chris Tucker
I’m no gimmick, we smell out the timid
We lift something out the trunk that got a kickstand with it
You either fall now or stand with it
You either crawl now or get laid down
Think about it, I’m only giving you one minute
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, bloaw, you’re too late
Motherfucker, meet your fate
Look between my eyes
You can see the fire burning like my Lamborghini tires
And my burner from the four fifth which is the four five
Which is that ninety-five Jordan shit
Jordans on your feet, we gon' take them shits
Put them on our feet and reshape them shits
Now don’t they look sweet?
Wear em for a minute, sell them the next week
That’s good profit, y'all ain’t thinkin' logic
You talkin' ass backwards like criss cross pockets
Mel Gibson, you just actin'
Lethal weapon, I take you niggas to target practice
Teach you niggas a lesson or two
Won’t you listen when a grown man is lecturin' you?
Cause any weapon will do in the process of fuckin' up you, nigga
You rappers ain’t built like us
Y'all just lift a lot of weights and look tough
We see through that, we shoot through anything that’s buff
And we ain’t thinkin' about handcuffs
The police runnin' from us, we so hard bodied, trust
Tongue tissue ass niggas man, ay wait, we say, either go hard or go home, tha- tha- tha- that’s what we go by, either stand for something or fall for anything nigga, bite that, o- open your mouth, bite that go ahead, you’re suicidal
Yeah, , oh fuck, I’m winning anyway, I’m winning, I’m winning any mother fuckin' way, I can’t lose
Welcome to the story of my life, the mis-education of Kendrick
Stressin Hennesy shots throw 'em back like it's vintage
Wondering can I live where is the generosity
Something's just gotta give, tryna stay positive
My motives to be a mogul, searching for a dollar without compromising my vocals
Really I'm just a noble kid from the westside of Compton
My cousins were selling crack while we play Sonic
You niggas is nonsense
I say that you full of shit
And need a colonic or maybe the Heimlich maneuver to throw up what you consume
My shine is bright enough to make a dead flower bloom in a room full of curtains
I'm for certain that I'm certainly popping the pistol verbally
And never will I get shot, your aim is all fucked up as if your sidekick dropped
I'm nice with a... throw over and over again
You know who I do it for
Me, me
Uh, yeah, yeah, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a don’t-a don't exist
Girl, I know you want this
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar (Uh)
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Uh)
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast
Watch her getting jumping like third grade barrettes
Let the beretta blow you die slow while I smoke on chron-ic
Try to throw salt homie like dry sweat gun powder flow through triceps
I'm more advanced got a corvette flow, I spit like Murcielago
Through precipitation I give rappers a sun tan
Rapping like a promotional van when I pull the drum out
Clap more than a Beatle fan, never heard a sound like THIS
I'm number one, you're forever number two like Siamese
This is New York rap on gold d's
Jay Rock proceed
Crooked cops
Stop sign got a bullet whole, don't stop
Speed through it like a drag race, or get buried under the state
K.Dot
Expose niggas for who they are
Under their white T might be halter tops
Rap fags, the black mag come with a complimentary black mask
Black Jason, red beam on the Glock
Money talks, I'm trying to have a life long conversation
Live like a silver spoon caucasian with a chain of hotel rooms across the nation
No home training, break 1,000,000 dollar vases
Here we go yo, here we go yo
I got the special kind of flow they call it Hip-Hop antidote
Murder MC's, if you're a rapper please check your pulse
(Hurry Up) too late
(Flat line) John Doe
New level Hip Hop
Where my shovel? Let me convince Nas
Dig a couple graves tell 'em that the new rap zombie is alive to invade
On the masses south central true best I
40 Glock stashes, buck 50 score left eye
Going back to Cali in a New York state of mind
I can't wait
You know, nigga ain't never hopped on no, no subway train you know
Might catch the blue line or something
Metro Bus
125 St. down Rosecrans, 53 down central
Hahahaha, It's all new to us you know
Get out the hood for once
Statue of Liberty, I wanna see the fire on that motherfucker
The fire really burn in that motherfucker?
Heh, you see a nigga don't a nigga don't ever know and shit
I ain't never seen snow nigga
Southern California
Crenshaw, gangbanging can't slang it
I wanna see some NY fitteds
Get used to them L.A. cats, heh
Puerto Rican mamis, nigga don't got no puerto rican mamis, nigga we got Mexicans nigga
Straight up, haha
Uh, Hannibal Lector pressure inside my veins
You nothing but a tangible wrestler
Stressed to entertain, I intertwine
With rhymes, while circling candles in the rain
Cause a seance, call my great aunt
And tell her I'm insane
I love the night life, Dracula, e-parasite, where my fangs
Knowing my vice, advice-giving by killers who obtain
Bullets and dice, gamble with it
Put dentures on your name
Price on your head
Sell it for cheap, like an eBay domain
Blucker, ey fucker ! my pedigree might fuck ya
No homo, take yo logo, and yo promo to an usher
To walk it down them church pews
I killed it had a curfew
A 6 p.m, a black p.m
That's all they seen, I tucked a murder weapon in my brain
My nigga, you know the drama I bring
Clinically Saddam Hussein
While fucking on the Dom Hossain
Thas a famous bitch
Now tell me who you hangin' with
Its a Privaledge
To fuck with Kendrick and Kevin durant on some gangsta shit

Only aliens can see the signs
Jupiter's intruder, I'm, looking for another universe to climb
Now listen my friends, not to offend
But this is a story told over again
So many niggas tryin' to fuck with the king
But the only problem is they can't win
I gets down my younging
Please turn it up just to sound my younging

Either the cake or the trait bound my younging
This the brand new trunk
Rattling, B tackling
Big truck paddling
Dime piece beauty peagant-ing
Pick em up then they (uh) saddling

Big truck fit five chicks at a time
Stones big enough you can go rock climb

The hollywood hills next to Omarion

I got a pool, inside of a pool, inside of a jacuzzi
And I ain't lying
Man, I'm not lying
My sister got a jacuzzi in her bed, in her pool
That's how we living
That's on me
That's on everything I love
Yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
Two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job
A month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that her mother said she won't see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges brought up
I shook my head, turned around then found a $100
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why I don't know why I don't know why
Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor
I stormed out then seen a black Honda Accord
Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
Closed my eyes then asked myself how I was feeling
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willing
I came to grips, jumped up, and looked out the window
See my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this is meant for
Me to give them a $100 then trash my pistol
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with the headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely had patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
Went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I could shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
But why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a black woman wishin'
She sayin' this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
But why I'm so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down to the top
I love god, I love speed, I love drank, I love me
I love oceans in the deep
I love women, I love me
I love God
But I’m scared of god speed
Sometimes
Wrote this song looking at a broke home maybe
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and baby
Somebody say "Kendrick American they sho’ is crazy"
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye
He said homie you messed up
You breaking my good luck
You wishing for miracles
Living through shit, you’re crying hysterical
Settle for everything, complain about everything
Say your soul crack, my world amphetamines
You projects ain’t it, I live in the hood
You living to keep warm
I’m living to pay rent
I paid my way through
Praying to Allah
You played your way through dealing with Wi-Fi
Bull shit yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
Your pain ain’t mine half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me
See I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town
Corn row Kenny
I wanna get the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr
I wanna get the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr, skrr
Corn row Kenny
So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I react
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure play with him, you get killed
Play with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb things in my past
Love will give me hope and I won’t relapse
Dave just bought a new nine eleven
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Rashad got his son dripping in gold
Me? I’m ‘bout to let my hair down on hoes
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Top billing that’s a million a show
Might blow the Whole Remy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave got a Grammy this year
Mack wop, but he do what he want
Level two, level two
No I’m not done
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
I could put a rapper on life support
Guarantee something that none of you want
Then hold me down and they yell something like
Rent is like twenty five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and skrrrt?
What if I empty my bank out and skrrt?
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
Tell me that, tell me that
That, I am the One
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got
You ain’t got tell me that, what I’m the one
Yes, I’m the one
Aha, and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
That you are likely to catch cause your latest ex made you mad
So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die - in it
Then reincarnate as a fly - gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
This the Olympics
State your name, live in the moment
It’s your time to own it, I see it in you baby
She tell me that she never get a first let away
And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them big trucks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we die - in it
Pull 'em to the side, let me slide up in it
Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today…
I feel like
I feel like
I feel like
Bumping some shawty
Rollin my window down and hitting the highway
No its not Friday
But its my day
And sometimes shit gotta go my way
Niggas got me fucked up
Thinking that my music don’t stick like some nunchucks
Top dawg and we all stars like we run chucks
But never mind that
Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game til' I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit haters die young
You can run to the poor pit
Pullin' off the pit stop
Car like a flip flop
Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot
I don’t even trip doe I don’t need no company
Me, I’m thinkin long term tryna' build a company
Kendrick the good kid
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today
Nigga, what I depose be so potent
That if the earth dried I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on a jet-ski and start West-Coastin'
I’m not boastin' or braggin' not a person I’m a dragon
Takin' action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came tell him that I be alright
I’m so high off life that I can OD
Walk outside then sniff a whole key
Old lady done called the police
Its just an average Joe walkin' with his heart on his Pendex
Don’t be afraid to speak
So to speak you niggas not within arm reach
Y’all midget Max swingin' on Shaq now have a seat
You can never coexist with my momma’s oldest
Kendrick be thy name
I got my mind right
My nigga locked in the pin, that's what my mind write
Ink over my brain
What's up
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today
So let me start off the third verse
Pickin' up your favorites is our curse
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissin'
Fuck you because you don’t see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too
Because she’s cute and the ass
Looks like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches
Fuck niggas that can’t fight so pull triggas'
Fuck the new world gas price that cost a livin'
Fuck your love fuck your hate fuck your snitchin'
Whether you fuck with me or not
I don’t give a fuck you can keep your props
Fuck keepin' it real
I'm a keep it K-dot
Kendrick everyday Jay-Z didn’t lie
Fucker
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today
Today… Today… Today…Today… Today… Today…Today… Today… Today…
Thinking they hot cause they homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hours, these niggas better get they bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my AC
My jewels is on and I wish one of y'all try robbing me
I shoot and have you laying between the sheets with the Isley's
We push the coupe like a high speed and the helicopters come and realize theres nothing behind us, it's behind me
Your honor, I fuck over these beats with no condom
This ain't really a rap, it's a porno, rewind it back
It's back to defining a loss, correct, they don't obey
Y'all ain't nice nigga, y'all just okay
Y'all more than a Lil Jon phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, a modern day Issac Hayes
Fingers on the shaft, new to the theme song of your career
Study my craft, you ignorant?, I can do it without a pen and a pad
It's inspiration, something y'all have never had
If my pockets is something you're trying to grab, see I pull out a rocket and peel you back like scab, you old news
Old dudes get out my way let the young boy come through, don't mention my age, SHIT
I'm on a mission for pay and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you're here
But actually you ain't accurate fucking with this music biz
The industry like "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, Jaws is here jump in the water
Do we really fuck with president Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the bidding war popping like an auction
Five or ten labels like "What he hitting for"?, seven zeros or more
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door
Money in front of me I couldn't open the door
I'm so far ahead of my time I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
I'm hardly impressed with y'all, I hate rappers
Where the true artists at?, if it ain't a good picture you draw don't bring it to the architect
Often y'all arguing 'bout who got next
Claiming y'all running the game niggas is barely walking yet
Hopping all over beats without going through training camp
Try studying a few greats and then maybe you'll be where I'm at
Your songwriting ain't great, your mixtape is mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, you're not
Switching your flow, your flow in the same place
Don't just rap elaborate, expand, try to be more creative perhaps
My rap friends, I ain't saying that you whack, psych
Like an invoice I'm just stating the facts, right?
The metaphors I write
In fact you've been a factor you've feared your whole life, no TV show
Don't compare me with them, that's like Jaws vs. Nemo
A gorilla to a chimp, Jordan vs. Kukoc
A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Two-two, what's the deal homeboy?
Aye
Big money, big booty bitches, man that shit, we gon' death of me
You see me on TV thinking "oh, TDE got the recipe"
I cut, call me K. Dot and this is Jay Rock and y'all rest in peace
All the rappers they be talking about, bust right now we gon' IP
Hold up, I said hold up
You thinking oh what? You can't talk about it
If you want to see us come around and move the crowds out
Because we got the loudest
L.A., we in the streets right here
Niggas seen God in projects
Everybody in this crowd right now, go and tell me about that prospect
Reach my surroundings when I move out cause dudes envy
Something like Prince Akeem 2 in the semi
Super soak ya, anti-social, for the mail I'll go postal
Postpone your post put it on pause with no controller at all
Just a nickel plated fo-fo, pockets got a melody, carryin' notes
Without bad breath, still carry the scope
I infrared whoever infiltrate, or disrespect, my money make it intellect, like a safety you intercept, a chain of bullets
They vics when they rubbing your chest, pincher
I treat all beef tender, no shook ones around here son
You like Michael Jay Fox when them bad boys come
Not Will Smith or Martin Lawrence, I'm talkin' 'bout boys that'll surely inspire your life insurance, life is short
Your reality is at the height of a dwarf
Say goodbye to the bitches and the champagne corks
Say hello to the ditches where your homies is tossed, in it
Porche blocks be black tinted, everything stocked
Catch me running over civilians, middle finger up when i'm removing the ceiling, dissect the whole block when i'm removing your building, this goes out to every man, woman and children
I don't discriminate, shook ones get earthquaked
It's K. Dot, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, I said Philly
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Who say West Coast niggas don't know anything about real hip-hop?
I'm 'bout to give you a prime example
Where my gangstas at? Where my dimes at?
Where my nickels and dimes at?
.45's Mac 10's and nines at?
9 times out of 10 half of y'all will die in this combat
If its 12 of you, shells bubble like Alka-Seltzer
You wanna die? I can help you
I'm feeling like Muhammad Ali in his prime
Mike Jordan in his heyday
Call me Jeff Gordon in that hard top swerving in between the lines
I'm tryna see a better way, I still feel hatred
Uncle Bobby's still incarcerated, Grandma died in Vegas
Grandpa moved to Mississippi
I really can't tell if dude missed me
Probably stretched out on the floor, with an empty bottle of whiskey next to his earlobe
More reason why my heart cold
Prior to a lot of hatin' going, Feds raided the studio
We tryna do songs, but they ain't listen
They just kick down the door as if they have permission
Why you had to do that for?
I wish Pro Tools was on record
Wish I was sitting in the booth doing the chorus or something
No assumptions, I know I'm nice
I know I'm walking the path of greatness, no compass
Not Atheist, but the bars reside with Satan
Chokin' the mic, releasing my frustration
Rather do that before I catch court cases
Locked up by Caucasians, claustrophobic
Boxed in like a new Porsche rollin'
Stones on my wrist, iceberg, Titanic frozen
K. Dot's in my colon
That nigga, Colon Powell
Modern day war victim
Oh, I'm foul, come join my coalition
No snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant
Feel relentless, new apprentice
King of, comprehension
No competition
Compton's back, pump your fist like this and that
No sumbliminals, I'm listenin', face the facts
You're a disgrace to this rap business
Just a one-man office, you need assistance
Gun tucked, walk in the club, set off sensors
I am a senseless thug, with book smarts
And anybody wanna go at rap legends, without theirself to question
We gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession
Gave you the rhyme scheme before your English education
Exclamation, put it in quotes
I say I'm better than most that say they're the ones that gave 'em swag
The flow, the artist development
Am I who gave you the growth?
You didn't bloom by yourself, somebody had to plant the seed
The sun shine, and now king me
The rapper's rapper, the MC's MC
Kodak moment that's been captured, cheese
I said cheese
Mind-boggling, word gargling word-ologist
What you hollerin'?
I got enough spit to form my very own island, my friend
Wanna take a swim?
Step into the booth, you'll probably need a bathing suit
Skinny-dipping, my thoughts inside a pool of sharks do
You hesitate to test the waters of a fish tank
You first-timer -- You need more than one-liners
Your color scheme is undone, all you have is the primer
Paint pictures like art designers --
Architect when I often draw the tech
Then put your carcass over your set when the words eject
Celibacy flow --
Really don't matter the sex, just letting you know --
Women could get it quicker like chlamydia nigga
Disease-infested, please consider --
The piece of her comprehension inside my jurisdiction
And you can't deliver
Sometimes I look in the mirror and ask myself what I'm scared of
How dare the media portray me this way, I can hear the
Crowd screaming, the weirdest of chants, they all in my ear-a
All that's an error, role model I can't
It's like I'm a parrot, apparently I'm marking the dance
I've seen done with the devil, such a ghetto romance
How many niggas fall victim, looking at you trapped in the system
Mentally they kept you in prison, and you won't get out, no one visit
Open up your mouth no one listen, you in denial, nigga
I'm in denial with you, I dial dead homies numbers off this liquor
Time and time again I find myself inside the cerebellum
Of several felons, Orion's belt couldn't live in my world
I seen tigers, lions let loose and spooked, I'm next door to Earl
I guess I rely on Jesus to save us before I refer
The madness, my neighbors witness ski masks
The masses don't know I'm packing this four and harassing your ho
Antagonizing the business you love the most
See the difference to my approach is a 40 ounce at the store
If a forty bounce to get low, I never learn, I'm hard-headed
The corporate world don't like it, but I said it
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
When I kick it, I kick it as if the beat was my enemy
You have thought it was ten of me, on point like a widow peak
I deliberately give 'em dillies that do what it do
Painting a picture like doodling, dude you ain't shit but doo-doo
In the city where the semis get pointed at him, them and you
You can hide, you get, if you want to, I do karate moves
But the crouching tiger just might get broken down by a writer
Yeah the passenger hopped out, but you got shot by the driver
There's a killer like everywhere, so why would you take it there
Neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared
That's why my intelligence tell me to keep a banger
Tell me "fuck you" I'll tell you fuck you back with my index finger
I can flip on some killershit but I'd rather keep cool
Keep it so remind it try not to be a pussy like you
Nigga that Cali cold attack, Cali on my back 'till my torso break
This is where it's at, that's gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
I tote a Smith'N I'm so malicious I blow your wig in
Make 'em close the stitches, Hell's Kitchen, I'm throwing dishes
This is spoken wisdom as I journey a poet's mission
I'm up lifting, my flow is gifted
Should come with a bow of ribbons
Road to riches, load the biscuits let's go the distance
I'm blow and listen my car how why you with a broke ignition
They so suspicious, low and vicious with no convictions
Juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison
Cold adrenaline I got this soul like a poet's living
So is spitting it's like I'm co-existent to prohibition
I'm a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it
Disrespect the spirit, or the artist who rap with lyrics
Mother-F statistics they rap with metaphysics
And they yeah simplistic, they stay out as repetition
Show some recognition
Heard your album my best of missed it
Best that ever did it
Papoose is the definition
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
If you look inside my mind you'll probably see atomic bombs
Loaded with explosive grenades holding dope rhymes
And it's potent
You never heard a heroic flow more divine
As a poet I know I'm the don
Like sunrise and I owe it to family genes
The Albert Einstein in the pocket of dungarees
And I'm dunking on Shaq with ease
It's a lay up every time I stay up
I'm in the studio the time they wake up, but wake up
It gets worse
There's not a weapon that can prosper
The prognosis of a sick rapper that can rock ya whole roster
Or catch a snow blizzard if Kendrick gon' visit
I'm that cold with it, you know me
My intellect get intertwined with God
Get washed up like a tide if you don't pay your tithes
Oceans divide whenever I speak
Cars will collide when I'm on this beat
Wreck shit for the record once the record peak
Brittany Street
Living proof for the ‘mazing is
Scooped up your broad now my palm on the cranium
Gettin’ dome, indoor stadium
You must suck at life, I’m on the cusp of hypes
Unattainable to most, safe to say I’ve touched the sky
Show some respect for the toughest on the mic
Daytona, paint images like Iliad from Homer
What you hearin’ is quotables
You never get it if you slow to move
Success smell sweet like when roses bloom
Defeat like sea salt in an open wound
I know some goons that keep the strap on like rented bowling shoes
No lenience for idiots, my five thoughts beyond smart
He’s a muthafuckin’ genius
Either it’s something that you can’t reach
Or it’s something that your whack mentors can’t teach
Genius
Banner in the lab before the gamma radiation got to damage him
You bore me, what of Arabia? Pen prick
Dot my I’s, got my eyes fixed on Angelou’s prize
Bleed ink never cry, logic on the fly
I promised I would try to bring more
To make your lightbulbs fry
Shy of autism, walk with him he’s Rainman, huh
Talk with him just to figure out the game plan, ha, game theory
Marvel my brain picking pieces of a sane man
I make it rain again
Beautiful mind of intuitive design
By omega in the skies
And we don’t brainstorm, just cause you will waste it
We make it drizzle just a little go ahead and taste it
The brainiac has made it, a makeshift
Modern day genius, Act Proof that crazy shit
Dustin Hoffman, on again, off again
I’ll find out whoever the comp is
They will see I’m kind of a monster
Honest, I’m one of the smartest, like I’m from Boston
MIT-in’ it
Shit, clean cut, read a few books to get up my bucks
Give ‘em a mean look, believe it they seem shook, they stuck
Niggas get steam cooked when I read books
Roastin’ cats when provoked, and peep the Opus
And show it whenever class is in session
Know it, get out your notes
This genius shit? I wrote it, let’s go
Pimp-pimp hooray
Pimp-pimp hooray
Hooray
Pimp-pimp hooray
Pimp-pimp
Classic Timeless rules forever
By the time I start writing when I was thirteen I knew from the jump I wanted something that was original that was classic
I freestyle over anything give me a instrumental
I bet I make bells ring
I bet I make birds sing
It sounds that good
I'm so street and I'm so hood
And I'm intelligent and I'm special and I'm heaven sent
Haha
When you think about rhymes and style you always want a classic feel so my first introduction to a classic shoe was the moment I stepped in school and said, I want to put something down on paper. I started writing. Everyone in the classroom was wearing Reebok classics
Hip-hop was more than just the music. It was part of culture. It was part of havin' style it was part of a whole graffiti and arts
Hot off the press
Hot off success
Look how I dress free, me
Reebok complete
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This sh- is vital, I know you had to
This sh- is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that -sy on a pedestal
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherf-in' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car!
Come on, we finna roll out!
I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!
How can I change the world, but can't change myself?
How can I please the world but not God himself?
How can I have the world, still need some help?
How can I see the world, stuck in this box?
How can I change the world, but can't change myself?
How can I please the world, but not God himself?
How can I lead the world when I'm scared to try?
Why should I need the world? We all gon' die
I ain't no joke I used to let the mic smoke
Now I'm like Mike Jordan with the flow
Identify with a scientific scope
Scope over the rifle
Fragments and potholes
Got rappers selling surveillance behind black tint in the parking lot at Roscoes
Making the change lift straight jack move
Pack 2 some mechanic
Pull it out you panic, flow nuts like cashews
Shift to Cancun, even though I’m Compton
Like Raider Caps and Corduroy house shoes
I be the illest witness the lyrical drug dealin’
When I distribute the word these rappers get hard feelings
No remorse sucka MC’s throw fits cause I carry the torch without Olympics
Kill all friendships my enemies
Go against the God MC? penalty crucifixion
So nice wish you had 3 ear drums to listen
Damn right I be the don Corleone of rap songs whether on the east cost or back home
We clap chrome like magnetic monkey wrenches
Used to hop fences
Now we hop on top of bad bitches pass em to the homies like basketball assists
West Coast Vengeance, East Coast Revenue something new like
Pac in Versace lenses Big in the Khaki Suit
Best of both worlds when I step in the booth
Suicidal thugs from them him her and you
I kick away the chair you hang from the noose
Shoutout to sidegun and Papoose, Kunta Kinte and ?
Bringing it back to the roots, you understand
Come right back
I play the passenger
Dumb shot then pour gas on ya
Acting like Nelson as I laugh at ya
The young boy Casper ya
Ya soul rise out the casket bruh
New rap game lazarus, Top Dawg ENT Soliders ain’t nothing after us
I woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it
After that, put on my heat like Alonzo Mourning
Cause everybody got a gun, it's like they're copy cats
So me without one is like I'm dated
I'd be out of style like Adidas and fat laces
Starter Jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late 80's had favored
I'm one of the best of my Homo Sapiens
One of the best of God's creations
He shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations
I know you mad, you ain't gotta say much, I can feel you hating
Serving mc's like waitress, Andre Agassi, multitalented
Rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, they're screaming in agony
Half of these niggas ain't half of me
Half of these niggas ain't talking 'bout nothing, yakity, yakity
Pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly
Actually, Kurt, Co-Bain
Ten years in my career, pray to God that I don't blow up my brains Lord, I'm here
Great Depression, I don't know much, all I know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up
They call me Subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts
Cut from a different cloth, and these Yves Saint Laurent jeans;
They cost so much
(?) Usher
Either way i'm caught up in materialistic
Anything that's custom, best believe I'mma get it
Getting tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on the Compton premises without your weap-on on your hip
The home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent
No matter the crime rate I still remain content
Moving at my own pace, cause if it don't make dollars
Then it really don't make sense, and if you can't comprehend
I holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence
(Holla) - x4
YA! YA! YA! YA!
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan
YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from
AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all, duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
Lets get It!
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"I said, where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I say—
YA! YA! YA! YA!
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
The sun it hasn't died
Deep in my bones
Straight from inside
Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, when they start their Martial Law
When these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Lord, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't really care and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, energy go to the almighty God
Drown in a bottle of Hennessy, with no amenities
I'm gettin' better with time
Aaah!
Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time, can you
Hey
Can you feel me with time
Oh
Can you feel me with time, can you
Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time
Radioactive, radioactive
We're livin' in a gold bar (Runnin' to the right law)
Duckin' in the trap (Duckin' in the trap)
Livin' in a group (Livin' in a group)
Watchin' TV (Watchin' TV)
Dedicated to the homies in the pen, hit me
(Hey, hey, hey)
Uh, this is a word premiere, this is a world premiere
(Hey, hey)
Uh, I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil want to put me in a bow-tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yeah, yeah
As I look around me
So many motherfucker want to down me
But an amigo never drowned me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And I love myself
Ho, when you're lookin' at me, uh, I tell me, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
I love myself
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, it ain't that high
I love myself
Uh, one day at a time sun gon' shine
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep movin'? (Keep movin'?)
Or let the paranoia haunt you (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confident
Everybody lack confident
How many time my potential was anonymous?
How many time the city makin' me promises?
So I promise this, huh
I love myself
When you're lookin' at me, I tell me, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
I love myself
Uh, illuminated hands of God, boy, don't seem shy
I love myself
One day at a time sun gon' shine
Want to say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
(These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation)
Aw, man, I duck these cold faces, post a fee-fi-fo-fum basis
Uh, dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky can fall down, the wind can cry now
Strong in me, I still smile
I love myself
Uh, when you're lookin' at me, uh, I tell me, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
I love myself
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't be shy
I love myself
One day at a time sun gon' shine
Everybody, hit me
Walk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet)
Down, down valley deep (Down, down valley deep)
Fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum)
My heart undone (My heart undone)
Aw, man, ay, check this out
It's a real Compton thing goin' on right now
You feel what I'm talkin' 'bout? You dig that?
Sometime I just feel a little bit b-beside myself
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
This here's the return of Enoch
And we gon' do it to y'all like this
Here we go, one, two, three, hit me
I love myself
The world is a ghetto with big guns and Dickies signs
I love myself
But it can do what it want whenever it want and I don't mind
I love myself
He said I got to get up, life is more than suicide
I love myself
One day at a time, the sun gon' shine
I went to war last night with an automatic weapon
Don't nobody call a medic
I'm a do it 'til I get it right, war last night
I've been dealin' with depression
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could, I could never take the lead, never bob and weave
Negative is lettin' them annihilate me
Evident I'm movin' at a meteor speed
Finna run into a buildin' there
Money in the ceilin', lay my body in the street
Pass me to the buildin' of the holy unseen
Pass me to the feelin' of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make a everybody scream, "I love myself"
I lost my head
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh, woes be me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry
YG, chicken wings, I love myself
I love myself, I love myself
Aw, man, ay, ay, homie
I told you it's straight up a Compton thing
You dig what I'm talkin' about?
And this here's dedicated to the homies
Y'all feel what I'm sayin'?
Sometimes I just get besides myself
The return of the Enoch is back
You hear what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Uh, I've been lookin' for you my whole life
Appetite for the feelin' I can barely describe
Where you reside?
In a woman, is it in money or mankind?
Something's got me losin' my mind
Where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the dirtiest pistol
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day
I could be your advocate
I could speak for you if you tell me what the matter is
I could preach for you with the mighty tongue
I'm the one, how can I overcome
Negative energy, more like infinity, and survive?
What I look like, a sucker to you, nigga?
Fuck you, rookie
Somethin' incredible, heh-heh-heh
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Turn that shit up, boy, bump that shit
Nigga, hold a handgun and dump that shit
Nigga, buy that borough and fuck that bitch
And kick her out before the sun come up
Nigga, my funds is up
I got my money right
Business movin' like New York City lights
Bitches all over that boy
Cause they know that young boy got a cold strut
But I don't fuck with them hood rats, they'll set you up
And I ain't goin' out just like that
I'd rather go out over a shoot-out, plow
Land of the scandalous, every corner got a candle lit
Every stop sign got a hollow tip
Every sunshine got a hood under it
And you know we Marilyn Jones runnin' that shit
My bones made out of cement, strong arm
Explode on y'all, Vietnam, boom
Heh-heh-heh, okay, I'm ready, ha-ha
Tell your boyfriend to do it like this
A thousand for the jeans, three hundred for the kicks, bitch
I was born with diamonds in my wrist
So, it's only right for your boy to talk shit, yuck
Straight nasty, don't walk past me
I just might grab it, just might pull a blade out and stab it
I would kill it only if you say
I'm more than willin' to take advantage
Legs to the ceilin', ho, throw away your panties
Tell 'em that we chillin' if your boyfriend harassin'
I take 'em, then I perform magic
Head on the freeway, seatbelt fastened
And go and tell the DJ to play my shit
You never heard nothin' like this, yuh
The new West Coast's best-kept secret
Chronic smoke comin' out my throat, ha-ha
Shit, ay, ay, heh-heh, fuck it, I'm goin' in
They say, "Who that?" K. Dot, no roof, new top
They hate, they watch, speed down the block
In a Porsche Box, stashbox, got a new Glock
In a shoot-out with anybody that you got
.45, no lie, no problem
If he got his jewels on, I'm a Black Rob him
Nigga, I'm a bad boy, I'm a black ski mask, boy
I'm a run in his house, then ask, "Where the cash, boy?"
"Tell me where the safe or this'll be the last time
That you ever have a gun in your face"
Might be the last time that somebody run in your place
You picked a bad time to be at fuckin' home today, stupid
I'm ruthless, I'm Eazy-E, I'm Snoop, shit
I'm 2Pac, I'm inferno, I'm so hot, no chicken
Tell it to the Colonel Sanders, do it for that Compton campus
Heh-heh, I'm done with the fourth quarter
Shit, psych, Rock, get 'em
We told you, heh-heh-heh, we told you, ah
Top Dawg, nig, we told you, nigga done did it
Yeah, yeah, aye
Sittin in the hooptie, looking for a groupie
Bitch I'm K-Dot, act like you knew me
Got me fucked up me don't pay for no booty
You looking for a prize, bitch I'm not no fool G
I'm hot like Cooly, sicker than the cooties
I got all the juice, you something like a Poomby
I'm soon to be the greatest for the ages of the young
Watch the game like a raven, craving rappers till I'm numb
Novacane can contain the pain that I brung
Bitch I shine like a microscope bouncing off the sun
Words bouncing off my tongue like a damn trampoline
Hoes manicure him enough the bottom of my jeans so I kick him off
Got haters pissed off, used to have no bank
Look at my account, you see O's like Rick Ross
I drift off to the moon, martian
Use the Big Dipper as a teaspoon
Parking my UFO somewhere that you don't know
Welcome to the C4
You see one you see four
Bombs in my peak hold
Bombs over Baghdad, son you niggas
You can never say I was a bad dad
Run you nigga like a marathon
This is when Vietnam meets the Babylon
Bring it to yo front porch, tanks on your grass lines
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, jumping from the foul line
In order to see the king you gotta swim through the ponds
Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')
Bitch I'm on my grind like I ain't made nothing
And to tell the truth, I ain't made nothing
Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')
Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')

Started out hustlin' (and I'm still hustlin')
Started out hustlin' (bitch I'm still hustlin')
Bitch I'm on the grind like I ain't made nothing
Riding around town, big taxi
I’m out in London, please don’t ask me
I don’t know when I’ll be going back to Cali
I don’t know when I’ll be going back to Cali
Said I’m riding around town, big taxi
Out in London, don’t ask me
I don’t know when I’ll be going back too, kay?
Skkrt skkrt, pulling up, G5 land in the valley
For the valley girls or them hoochie broads
I don’t know, I don’t like ‘em if they got some flaws
I don’t know, I don’t like ‘em if you wife ‘em dog
I don’t know, I don’t like ‘em, this is big bruhK-D-O-T, TDE
Damn, love or lust
Damn, all of us
Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience
If you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe
I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)
If you've got a little I'ma share a thought
You from Compton? Get your uncle, poppa
He a gangster, he know how to party
You ain't nothing like him
You a stranger to this
G shit
Fuck a sip, nigga
Take it to the neck, nigga
Take it for the dead homies
Homie, just a set
This the business
Many bitches, alcohol
Deal with it
Be a Navy Seal with it
Swim until you feel (drunk)
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)
Nouns and verbs, you just stumble over your words
So in love with my shit they save it in pampers
The only pull ups be the drive by when I pull up then pull out
Whatever you did shout I put up
Then take the residuals after leaving your body in critical
Yeah, Top Dawg E-N-T
And it's 187 on a muthafuckin' beat
Yeah, Top Dawg E-N-T
And it's 187 on a muthafuckin' beat
Yeah, Top Dawg E-N-T
And it's 187 on a muthafuckin' beat
It feels like I have a fuckin’ jukebox on
You niggas ain’t hot, you niggas lukewarm
And I had swag ever since I was born
And every car I drive, yes it must be foreign
So when I ride by your bitch yelling popcorn
I get up under your skin, yes I’m a fuckin' thorn
And they have a stash spot and you just been warned, bitch
I remember when it all started
On Alondra, in that small apartment
Burgundy carpet and SEGA cartridges
Pop a flick and blunt ashes all on the garments
Momma of off wine cooler, Magic Johnson played Jordan
I was only four, but it's like I heard it before
A house party cracking off of the music the Dr. recorded
And according to my awareness I was more than coherent
A cold listener, mocking that shit like a parrot
My cousins kicking up dust Cripping
They flag, wear it 'round their hand like a mitton
Aiming, use it for leverage
Shitting on Compton sheriffs like "Fuck the Police"
Woofers and gold Rollies
Every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped
Dropped a dub just to hear Doc drop
A jewel for the sake of hip-hop
Who ever have thought the moment I seen you on Bullis for Cali love
Fifteen years later you'd be saving my life, what
(Thank you doctor)
Reminiscing on when we used to smoke chronic
Now we puffing the kush and I'm like
(Thank you doctor)
For giving the West Coast CPR
Now here we are, we like to
(Thank you doctor)
We can never pay you back
All the shit you did for hip hop and gangsta rap
For that (thank you doctor)
Without further adieu
Diggy Doc, this one is for you
10,9,8
7,6,5
4,3,2
1
I kick a funky friendly conversation that keep they mind racin'
You can't complain about the flow I got
I let my thoughts space out with the astronauts
Like the white boys say, "Pass the pot"
Let me smoke for a minute...
As god as my witness, I never abuse this hip hop
I'll never pretend to be something I'm not
Giving you something to rock to other than hardcore rap, possible
You ever been under hypnosis I mean literally
Not being focused with your eyes open
They say 90% of humans don't even notice
Now can you imagine a couple of minutes passing without you knowing what happened
Without you knowing people was laughing at you
They say the worse scenario is when they have to catch you
You wake up out of your mind, your whole thoughts is baffled
You're doing things like trying to touch your shadow
Now here's some realistic, is it something that can happen or is it just a gimmick
You never know until your bear witness
Bear witness...
Bear witness...
You woke up in the morning, took a shower
Call some bitches over, want them to be over in one hour
She came over, you fucked
She left and you hopped in the truck, you
Took your shirt off cause outside was burning up, you
Skirted off turned your beat up but your gun was tucked
Under the seat, you headed to long beach
Hop on the 710 the carpool lane
Only cause you got black tint and they can't see a thing
Your check engine light popped up, its feeling like bad luck or what not
You tried to maneuver all the way to the call box
But one lane before you got there your car stopped
Stop
If your was listening for the past two minutes
Then you just made accurate 90% hypnosis
Hallelujah, K. Dot'll do ya
Quicker than a porno star, jump on my dick y'all
And get fucked by the millisecond
Duck when I pull the weapon from out of my mouth (Buh!)
Shots at you like a sawed-off
Aiming for your grill like I'm Paul Wall
Then peal 'til I not y'all
My cerebral cortex is like a war vet
Sharing war stories with the deceased, I'm brain dead
Straight bananas, I never gave a fuck
'Bout anything but my momma, my daddy, siblings, and grandma
And if you neither one of them, then I gotta answer
Every question with a bullet hole in my hammer
Like VH1, that's far beyond your comprehension
Like a deaf person showing up to court for a hearing
Who they fearing? K. Dot
Tickle the nipples of women
Make your bitch grab her crotch when she hear my shit, bitch!
K. Dot got the unorthodox flow
On fire, make a rapper burn his soul
Murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals
Numero uno, city in my rearview
Compton on my back like the titties of my masseuse
Pity, here you fool who?
Go against me, I rebuke thee
And wake thee up, six in the morning
With the pump, punks jump up to get beat down
Jump shot, coroners catch them on the rebound
Pans, pots, plates, bowls
I'm in your kitchen eating your stove
I'm hungry and hibernated
I'm cold as Miles Davis
I load up then I aim it
No judgment for the plaintiff
It only gets more heinous, nigga I'm brainless
Like a blind bitch who don't suck dick
Dinosaur manure, big shit
Smell me or die quick, fucka!
(Fuck a hook)
(jab, jab, jab, left right)
(Fuck a hook)
(Damnit, genius)
I can stand in a pool of gasoline lighting a blunt and never catch on fire
(How come?) Silly motherfucker, I'm fire
Smack the devil over the cheek, gave him a third degree burn
Iced it down when he was asleep, and said you'll be okay
A lot of rappers are desperate to be a star by the day
They hydroplaning, hoping that they get their big break
I'm just saying, I feel I'm the one
Like a magician with a stick inside his hand, or the name of a mexican
I gets ignorant with ya
Snap me a picture, bitch, I'm famous
I came in this world nuts in my palm and drinking Paul Masson
In a stolen Cavalier like I took LeBron
Locked him in a basement and amputated his shooting arm
(Psss) Now that's a stretch Ab-Soul
Like a fifty mile strip when I'm pimping these hoes
Call me Dolomite, nope I take that back
Found out he gay as a happy day or the way that you rap
(ee)
(K. Dot got the unorthodox flow
On fire, make a rapper burn his soul
Murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals)
(Look, ee)
(Damnit)
Goodbye, I know the rapper dead
I'm on my murder job again in the morning
This 187 on the line I know the rapper dead
That means another record label is mourning
So you can run but you cannot hide
Cause when I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
When I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
Mortician got a feeling with embalming fluid
Cause when I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
When I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
Lyrical homicide best believe I do
Yo Q, these niggas think they cute
Talking louder than the trumpet, when I see 'em where the fluke?
Your opinion something moving like pew pass by 'em, hog tie 'em For the revenue, bullets peer through the bulletproof
Look what the iron do scope now I'm eyeing you
Silencer, now my iron grew I en route
Learn, of the flow first to realize these rap guys
Shit on 'em then throw them to the flies bombs like Al-Ca-ter
Ride on my enemies, homicide
Text like a referee, give you free shot for any penalty
Drop metaphors, nouns and verbs plenty similes
Serve like a waitress and you don't want seconds courtesy
Off K Dot, the son of 2Pac
Biggies nephew Big L said I was special
Now let's do, lunch over these beats
Even Punch said I was sweet
Punchlines and kick hot rhymes 'till I'm burning my feet
Ouch
Goodbye, I know the rapper dead
I'm on my murder job again in the morning
This 187 on the line I know the rapper dead
That means another record label is mourning
So you can run but you cannot hide
Cause when I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
When I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
Mortician got a feeling with embalming fluid
Cause when I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
When I see 'em I'mma kill 'em
Lyrical homicide best believe I do
Get in the ass like animals imitators get plenty of
Propane, hotter when winter come, some insane
Dope mane, bee's the studio, You ain't lived here
Ever since I done came, record me yoooo
Your own momma wouldn't do that
She rather throw herself in the dumpster than listen to trash
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish these
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it
Make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfuckin' double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No)
You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
Let me, let me take this call real quick
(… lick me like a lollipop) He on your fuckin' ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do?
Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what, I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin'
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy
I'm killin' myself
Aw, this is four jiggling balls in your mouth all day everyday
Ay you tuned into a fuck what you hear radio where you can stick a dick in your ear and um
(Stick a dick in my ear??) Aw shut the fuck up bitch but anyway
We got this new K Dot record I know you a trap where you at baby
Down Rosecrans
'87 regal sipping on a gold can
Gun tucked like the fetal, position
Top Dawg coalition coexisting with the coldest you ever quoted from California district
Been a coroner like David Banner I'm the owner
Of the marijuana aroma you're smelling hear the donor yelling "it's me bitches"
Who did it, I did it, take 'em where they can't go
Like planet Venus leaning like a mad scientist
Laboratory bottles of empty Heineken telling stories about the ones that came before me
China-man squinting his eyes because I'm blinding him, my shine is
Bigger than a strike of lightning they liking him because I like to win
Never lose, put me on a pedestal
Bet I pedal victories until I pedal off my shoes
Welcome to the lions room, challenge anybody whom
Wanna try they luck they get fucked up and all you heard was (Oohh)
Say hello to the little big homie, and your reality ain't realer than this homie
Now with my hopes in the back
I could ride like this, or like that
Putting all the bullshit aside
K Dot be too funkified
Tell him he's too cool, bitches
Holla "what it do", bitches
What's cracking bounce, skate, rock, roll, hello, world, here we go
They be crackin' like a pack of sunflowers seeds
That the devil tree, put my dick on your double D, double D's
I learnt that from the dog pound, don't get mad at me
I'm just a product of what was happening in the nineties
Plus my uncle used to fuck with your auntie
Tell me 80 percent ho run in your family
Shame on you, shame on your mother, sister, cousin too
You all produced the same tendencies
While I continue to stack plentl cheese
On my expedition to witness my own odyssey
Out of three, of your favorite bet I give them more flavor like seasoning salt
Call me the Darth Vader invading a raw plot like a space crew, stayed at home
All the gangbangers with the police radars like the Marcus rustle but I hustle
Never change up see my muscle, training like I'm constipated bringing in any drama
If you insist, I'm six for six
Get your ass rolled and twisted, like a blunt rap so fall back
Like winter ended
It's like that (like that?)
Like that (like that?)
Like that (like that?)
C.O.M.P.T.O.N, that's the city that I live in
I got more drank bitch, bring more friends
Bitch bring more friends
I said C.O.M.P.T.O.N, that's the city that I'm repping
I got more dick bitch, bring more friends
Bitch bring more friends
Ahh, callers, callers call up and um, tell me what you think about that new K Dot record

Aw man I gotta, but anyway man, you Top Dawg niggas crazier than a motherfucker
Ay, who we got on line four?
Now with my hopes in the back
I could ride like this, or like that
Putting all the bullshit aside
K Dot be too funkified
Tell him he's too cool, bitches
Holla "what it do", bitches
What's cracking bounce, skate, rock, roll, hello, world, here we go
They say that I'm the one
And you, you are the prototype
You might have the ears of sound
But you already know who they like
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype
I am the truth, no lie about it
Bring my testimony when I walk in that booth
Walking the thin line between love and hate, I defend mines
Join them when it comes to their crunch time, I never fold
I love pressure, that's why I apply so much on niggas thinking they better
I am a clutch shooter, I am a sharp shooter
And it's great enough to hear the butterfly moving
Follow me moving through these ghetto streets and school I say fuck retarded sweep
Walk into school the chief right there tried to talk at me
In the midst of Piru and natty Blood beef
That 10-grade summer we had death right in front of us
Then leave the house without kissing our mamas
The new Jordans came out, but we didn't get them
Cuz the color haunt them to get too much attention
Damn it I liked it thoughs
Pac was talking 'bout the concrete rose
I never seen one till I looked in the mirror
There go, huh huh, that's the flow right there
You should use it, that's what my conscience said then I hopefully abused it, huh
I am the lyrics and the music, y'all rapping note for the beat
I let the instrumentals listen to me
I listen to heat, my ears can hear fire
I pierce through the flame like barbed wire breaking up concrete
And I ain't thinking 'bout no rap beef
Niggas is getting killed throughout the week, that's every day
Catchin' bullets like an umpire
We tried to stay home but still ain't safe
That's baseball tactics, retaliation back and forth like tennis rackets, we used to it
Who can circle 'round the block the fasters
If you can do it, think you know why it becomes a practice
We worked it out like barely total
Cuz shit happens
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype
They say that I'm the one
And you, you are the prototype
You might have the ears of sound
But you already know who they like
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody to hold you real tight
You niggas need hugs for real
Somebody tell 'em he's the prototype
Gather 'round, I'm glad everybody came out tonight as we stand on our neighborhood corner, know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have, listen. Keisha, Tammy, come up front. I recognize all of you, every creed and color, with that being said fuck your ethnicity. You understand that? We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you. All of you
Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck is you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse
They getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there, so it make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut! Man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide, behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind, so don't
You mind how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts
Everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
Going postal, never freeze up, when I approach you
That's star struck and roast you, oh my... HiiiPower
I'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus
I was kicking that Math, dropping that science
Like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass, lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me, I'mma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate, my dreams, get it right
Get a life, I got 2, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly, put wings on my back
That a plane or angel? Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa... Gross
I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you
I'm just a messenger, yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her
Put them 3's up, they notice that we up, HiiiPower
And the power in the people and if they don't believe us, they'll die
Yeah...
Hit the East Side of the LBC
On a mission trynna find Mr. Warren G
When I jumped off the porch, I was forced into last resort
Of a typical short end, of course where that took us course
Hoarse for yelling out Demons that fought inside of me, talk society how to rejoice
Killers aside of me, privacy obviously was lost
Fraud, Piracy of the streets of my Odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed
A good kid in a mad city slightly annoyed
I walk out the street with no heat and wanted to beef when i"m just a vegan
Reeking the scent of a saint, sinner smelling the stars squeezing
Pillars stumbling straight to my melon apparent reason
Probably because i'm a cousin, cousin of blood that blooded in public
And Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't' no friend of me, instead of Kendrick i'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, sure, if that's your remedy
Fair enough, i got enemies, but guess who bang?
But that's the repercussion like when your cousin is cussing a blood and your by yourself at the Compton parade
Good kid, mad city, life or death, is you with me?
Let 'em die, dead—Black Hippy
Pfffft—and we don't give a fuck
Hell, nah, nigga
This conglomerate so cool, Rock, we could freeze L.A., nigga
Black Hippy
Kendrick Lamar
I tell 'em like this:
Ring the alarm or wake to a bomb
You ain't a rapper, you Elton John, holdin' your john
I got a ton of croutons in the Louis Vuitton
That's big bread the chickens are flying flocks when I call 'em
Paul and Masson, half drunk, stuck in a poem
Light matches underwater while I'm bracing the storm
I'm cool and I'm calm, laid back, smoking a farm
Socking the shit out of niggas till I'm breaking my arm
Up in my zone, two blunts, cup of patron
.45 on me, shoot you if you fuck with me wrong
No homo'—pause—that's your life and it's gone
Flat line you, don't put your life in the song
I never drove a fast car—I almost ran over
Tracy Chapman, she said, "Drive slow," I said, "Fuck off"
Ab-Soul—wha'sup, y'all? Other than your sub-par
Above all? I'm a heaven gate—above all
Fuckin' great, and every time we in the stu'?
California economics got me hooked on it like phonics
When the beat drop I drop a bomb like atomic
Got my heat cocked like some type of bird
Big pimpin’ weapon under the fur
Limping’ like a prosthetic leg
But still play the back like bike pegs
La fitted cap pulling your wig back
With Glocks in it g roc black tinted
What side you claim fuck yo gang
Yeah Yeah thats what I’m talking bout nigga
Five in the morning I’m up cooking it up
Studio filled with coffee cups
I don’t sleep I just lay down and wink
I work like slavery was just last week
Somebody told me that every label
Got this button that beep and when I rap it go off
And thats when they know to push their album back
I don’t allow cats around the big dogs
You can’t see me, the force between us is thick fog
I never hang up when the money calls unless it be a emergency that my family involved
Don’t get your life involved, we’ll shoot without playing basketball, get your ass mopped
Like Lysol, you light MC, I’m heavy on the track
If you see my flow you would say its obese
Kdot/Lyrical Disease/Jay Rock
America's Most Wanted
Please
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me

That pussy got a spell on me
Hey lil pretty lil, pretty lil, bish you

Everybody wanna play that tough guy
'Til them things come out and them shots fly
Say your last words homie and it's bye bye
You shouldn't have been playin' with me
Everybody wanna play that tough guy
'Til them things come out and them shots fly
Say your last words homie and it's bye bye
You shouldn't have been playin' with me
I ain't no killer but don't push me
Them very words said can resurrect Pac straight from the dead
And it takes a young nigga like me to push the limit
No gimmick, this is real homie
I wake out of my sleep, sweat drippin' off my face and cheek
I swear to God, death callin' for me
That's why I carry a heat, roamin' these streets 'til they come and get me
Cause ninety percent of them are comin' with me
C4 your car doors and watch your shit blow in a jiffy
Quick, boom, explode when I empty
I'm on the edge so please don't tempt me to jump
I walk around with a pump, just to scatter you punk's heads
Then go and get some head by that woman you want
She does what I says, I says what I does
Crazy back then, yeah that's what I was
But now I'm psycho, mental nigga, holdin' a grudge
I put a hole in your mug, and let the blood leak out
Until it fill up a tub, then put your son in it
This is no image, this is ether
Cocaine, reefer, alcohol mixed with it
They tried to label your boy as a menace
Put me in some records, along with Guinness
I just started, I ain't finished
Chest to your head, until all you motherfuckers diminish
I hope y'all ready to ride
Cause it's do or die
If not, stay inside
I hope you ready
If not, be quiet
Cause when shots fly
Somebody will cry
I hope you ready
I hope y'all ready to ride
Cause it's do or die
If not, stay inside
I hope you ready
If not, be quiet
Cause when shots fly
Somebody will cry
I hope you ready
Slaughter pigs like farmer John
My style got its own ambience
You feel my presence? live life like everyday class in session
Learn something after 187 we burn some
For real kid, our uncle doing a 13 year bid
I pray to god he don't come out how he went in
Gets ill, these streets got me packing a 9 mill
My mind stay black, either kill or be killed
It's real in the battlefield son
Last week shawty do wop he at the ooh wop he said he ready to kill some
I said shawty chill, you ain't ready for that type of drama
Plus karma for real
He shook his head, horizontal
He said he was out on consignment some dudes on the block tried to rob em
Try? what you mean?
He said they tried until I reached in to the pocket of my jeans
I killed 2, but one got away which is bad news, because the hood didn't even cover my whole face
And I know he be back, but before he do that
I bring it to him first on the porch where he live at
Damn shawty I can't knock you, its survival of the fittest
With that said, do what you got to
I shook his hand, then I walked away, then reality took a toll on me
Shoulda never gave him that .38
Looking at the ceiling in my bedroom
Then the phone rang, hey K Dot turn on the news
They didn't even say his name
But I knew it was him when it said another 7th grader was slayed
It ain't hard to tell
This is for my mothafucking Compton babies
And all the wild blocks that drove us crazy
Dominguez Hospital born
Niggas dying fast no life insurance
Black ski mask green leaf body bag liquor poured
So much 40 oz poured it's like the curb's made of gold on the ave
Bullets got no names on it so if a girl get hit the response of it was like our bad

The world is anxious for my LP
Get pop grades, i get an A-plus, you get a D

Rolling down Rosecrans bumping D-A-Z
Feeling like 1-9-9-3 '91 to the seventh jam
I'm in Long Beach, home of dillagent, dilligent gangsta shit
Gangsters killing, you wanksters quit filling your iPod's up with classics
Ain’t a nigga out can out-match them adlibs
DPGC general
Jay know my breath marching, hold all my genitals
Yeah, it's like that cause I was taught that
Back when Dog Food dropped in the Compton swap meet parking lot
Daddy rehab three, so going to my pops we was popping now
The trunk in the caddy was rocking now
Slap a nigga in the face with a little waist, even make 'Pac salute
Snare like a bear trap, they're imperible too
Bear witness
Kids like Barry Bonds, that's the realest, nigga
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up

Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Yeah
You're now rockin' with the best
Hub City's threat
Minor of the year
K. Dot
Ooh, it's about to get so ugly in here
It's about to get so ugly
Like whoever's listening to this
Oh man I crack myself up
Yeah
Oh my God man, oh my God
We 'bout to shit on these faggots man
Check it
Yeah, K. Dot
*Let me get that*
First niggas used to rapping, get my attention
Now I don't even listen
It run through one ear and out the other
And I don't buy niggas records for music
I'm more interested in their album covers
I'm a talented brotha
Plus I move so quick it's like my brain came with a joystick
Motherfuckers better listen when I spit
I knock records out the park
Homeboy I Ken Griffey a hitch, and I might Ken Griffey ya bitch
But won't buy her shit, not even a small bag of chips
Just give her long pipe 'til it's scrapin' her hips
Like a waitress, the way the broad ask for the tip
If you want, just ask for a clip
I'll give ya those for free
I won't charge a fee
Just roll up on you, like cut off sleeves
Nobody can cut off the-
-number one rap artist
Damn, I am the hardest
Blowin' through Nintendo cartridges
To Maybachin it, valet parkin' it
Now people arguin'
Who is better? Them or him
Him referring to me
Them referring to the industry
Hands down, Jay left, now give me the crown
Fuck later, I'm takin' it now
Fuck haters, I'm takin' 'em down
With the red beam, red beam, silencer, don't holler it muffle the sound
Bark like ten rottweilers straight from the pound
I suggest you follow, or not be smarter
Seein' another broke tomorrow
You can tell the way I speak begins to stutter
First it was hard for y'all to even makin' it harder
Ain't about money, then please don't bother
Y'all niggas funny, talkin' bout that you run shit
When I'm lookin' at ya like "Who are ya?"
Y'all niggas is gas
And what make that bad is y'all niggas is trash
Y'all don't wanna see me spaz
Out, pull the gats out
And see me blast, ouch
You better off coppin' a pen and a pad
Than copyin' the last rhymes I had
And spit 'em to your homeboys 'till they all say "You wrote that?"
Tell 'em lies or, give 'em the facts
It don't matter 'cause in a minute, imma be chargin' my raps
A G for a bar, that's 3 16's, plus a 8 bar hook nigga, add up that
I charge you a verse like Dre would charge you a track
Your whole budget, hoes love it
But you hate it, 'cause I'm your girls favorite
Nigga, face it, you can't walk in my shoes nor change the sides tryna replace it
As far as rap, I spit in the Matrix
Past reality, nigga actually, I wrote a rhyme where there was no gravity
That's a whole 'nother planet
For real holmes, I do damage
Blow up ya city, even ya school campus
Run in ya class while your doin' ya standards
Let it blast
One gun subtractin' ya life, now that's the basics of math
Oh my God man let me stop spazzin' out on these niggas, b
They have to call 911, I'm done
Dave, you feel me man? It's real
K. Dot man, just havin' a lil fun up here man
It's real ugly, ya know?
Yeah, bang, bang, let's go
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
It's just been one of them weeks
Ruslan
Look, I should really be workin' on my album right now
But I couldn't help myself
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my eyes and you will soon find a greener eclipse
Tryna get though, from the get-go
You the blacks don't miss
Hey, it could feel the strangest
It could feel like you and your best friend are now becoming strangers
I can tell you that I have failed you
But you tell me I'm brainless
And I cannot change this
How can I say the scripture
When the ? for blind, it may not hit ya
Went on the road and I came back a star
Think that I made it and I am in charge
Seeing me different and thinkin' I switched
Man, this whole process is feeling bizarre
I'm just happy to be out of my script
Tell me why you think I'm different again
Taken for granted and then we'll be missed
Taken for granted, later will be missed
I can feel the changes
I can feel the same people 'round me, now they thinkin' I'm famous
My savior saved me, my city made me
And put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's outrageous, hate this
But please shutup, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from three planets away
I got my Word, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm singin'
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
I'm tryna to stay on the path, and not look on back to what we once was
You tryna churn into somethin'
Tip on that malt to get you that uuz
Feelin' the rapture
We live in a world, we live in a world
That wants to laugh at ya
We live in a world
I could be honest, I know they don't hear us
They carousel ? life continues propellin' us
Forward, they just wanna put us on the auction block but there's no way they sellin' us
Worth more than minimum wage
Forever you could relate
Any subliminal
Back in my criminal days, I would stil live in a way
That was reciprocal, this was nothin' I could change
So the Messiah was slain
Wow, what a miracle
Opened the door to be saved
Jesus opened the door for all of us to be saved
They ? like this
Been a long time, can't you see the Lord smiling
They waitin' on ? heart, the tank is all empty
Xs in the air, and they do it by instinct
Hide your children, hide your children
We are not better than you
Please don't put any of these rappers on a pedastal
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
We don't wanna hear anymore of your lies
My New Year's resolution is the Kings Dream movement
Shut your whole thing down, don't you question what I'm doing
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
Blewell jeans, Moby Dick stitching
Trigger finger itching
To trouble one of you niggas
I'm daring one of you niggas to jump
I'ma snatch you out pistol whip you
Then put you back in the trunk
Shit, I'm back in the front
The front page of the newspaper
They say I'm seeing more paper... true
But only if you knew that
I was in your house right now taking the paper from you
Where ya safe at?
Chick is swinging on the dick like a fucking bat
And catch it all like an umpire
I'ma go hard, rims bigger than the fucking car
Baby girl say why the fuck you even got tires?
I don't know, just get inside
And never question my shit again ho
I fold dough like a notebook
I see money, you pass it up like Magic Johnson no look
Who the fuck taught you niggas how to cook
That's what I'm hearing up in your song
Beat said if you're cooking up the product and your wrist don't hurt when you do it then you're doing it wrong (fucking bidness)
You know I'm surgical with this bitch Jake
How you want it dawg?
Closed Casket?
Remember that fool in a wheelchair?
How you think he got there?
I got my air-conditioning on right now
Real cool about it
Oil talking please
Slick with it
Wanna know what death feel like
I suggest that you stay in the house at night
The scope that I got for the long rifle fit pretty damn right
Plus my connect got a pretty good price
I could take off your neck with just one slice of the blade
No, I'm not Wesley Snipes
One cut can have her screaming out first aid
Been this way ever since first grade
Forte demeanour was to get paid
Birthday solution was to shoot straight
Thirteen I was ready for gunplay
Stand on the block taking pay
I get four shots like a freak oh he know
Not to fuck with K-D-O-T
Oh, I forgot
Never come around here without a Glock
You want beef with your boy
Nigga I put heat on your boy
Leave him tied up on the back seat
With your boy duct taped won't let out noise
Oh yes we got them toys
Oh yes we got them choppas
LAPD they can't stop us
Rockets shoot down helicopters
In the kitchen (in the kitchen)
Betty Crocker (betty crocker)
Got kick (got kick)
You hate (you hate)
You wait (you wait)
One sec (one sec)
I'll be back we then gon' west
No vest, I'ma aim at your face
Unless you can stop them
I'm so throwed
Oh yes people there is a problem
I say
You see they be loving the oil talk
Its real slick for them
I keep the air conditioning on
Cool, cool, cool)
Save on the ounce but don't know the price
But I know one time ain't bust late night
Trying to set me up so I gotta think twice
Ain't no fucking with it I'ma let em plague mic
I keep a nine for you dummies then I split your brain
I'm going to your safe, take your cash, cocaine
All your weed in your range cause you're going platinum chains
Watch as my city get gritty
Fuck pity, we gon' do you niggas shitty
Domino effect when we spray them with the semi
Big k-holes in your dodge you can hear me
Front to back
Stack for stack
Nigga go clip for clip
Either gat for gat (braaap)
Wise niggas better check my stacks
We let the match ratatat
And all the heads we crack
Stacked, lots of cheese
Tryna cop the gs
Cop the keys
To the boss got rocks to feed
Roster fees
Cause ain't nobody stopping me
I got a flow so cold
Style so bold
A nigga run up, I leave his face all swole
Hit him with the 8 better yet with the 4
And I don't feel bad he put himself in the hole
West coast in motion
Promoting another episode
Seasons change
There's still time for us to run away
Seasons change
There's still time for us to run away
Seaso—
Closed eyes, that's how you runnin' from your destiny
Superpowers can't relieve that
Dear God, why can't you keep me from these outsiders?
We're outside, outside, out (side, out)
Still runnin', can't let this jungle get the best of me
Superpowers can't relieve that
Dear God, why can't you keep me from these outsiders?
We're outside, outside, out
Closed eyes, that's how you runnin' from your destiny
Superpowers can't relieve that
Dear God, why can't you keep me from these outsiders?
We're outside, outside, out (side, out)
Still runnin', can't let this jungle get the best of me
Superpowers can't relieve that
Dear God, why can't you keep me from these outsiders?
We're outside, outside, out
I remember when it all started
On Alondra, in that small apartment
Burgundy carpet and SEGA cartridges
Poppa flickin' blunt ashes all on his garments
Momma off a wine cooler, Magic Johnson played Jordan
I was only four but it's like I heard it before
House party crackin' off of the music Doctor record
And according to my awareness I was more than coherent
A cold listener, mockin' that shit like a parrot
My cousins kickin' up dust, Crippin', their flag, wear it
'Round their hand like a mitten, aim and use it for leverage
Shittin' on Compton sheriffs like "Fuck the Police"
Woofers and gold Rollies, every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped, dropped a dub
Just to hear Doc drop a jewel for the sake of hip-hop
Whoever thought the moment I seen you on bullets for "Cali Love"
15 years later you'd be savin' my life, what?
Yeah, that's cool
Thirty two shots in the clip of his thirty four's a little nigga with heart
Frustrated with being broke while I was climbing the charts
Penitentiary chancin' and dancin' with suicide
Homie I got love for him
Angel on angel dust, I used to thug for him
Took me on my first mission, transition
Good kid turned rapper, pay attention
This is deeper than you think
Right after my admission inside the game, asked him bout whats his name
We brushed it off as a joke as we watched her get off the stage
I was promised to win, he was promised to leave
With all the favorite accessories
The one's the big budget videos had especially
Just a shadow in the dark, blendin' in with all the industry friends
So guess this is where the story begins, J Incredible, what!
I can think of a million reasons, have it all as your seasons
Say no more I feel ya b, say no more I feel ya homie
We traveled the Neverlands, fireworks in the south of France
Take it down and come again, again
But look
You don't get too dirty in my whip. whip, whip, whip
Keep it nice and flirty in my whip, whip, whip whip
Pop your pretty ass up in my whip, we gonna make it last up in my whip
Scorpio, talk to me, talk to me
Capricorn, talk to me, talk to me
K. Dot
Dave
Watch how K. Dot move, something not like you
Have your gun by you, 'cause niggas will try you
Watch how K. Dot move, something not like you
Have your gun by you, 'cause niggas will try you
Uh
Who's sick as me?
Tell the truth, bitch, nobody, and that's real
And as far as my eyes can see
I'm the only one fucking with me
Myself, so put your album right back on the shelf
And let real business get dealt
You ladies man like Leon Phelps
I pee on any man tryna discontinue my health
I don't give a damn on how you feel or how you felt
Your small mercy won't help
When shots circle around your waist like designer belts
Rock niggas like Bobby Boucher, you waterboy
What you want, weed, dope, or water, boy?
It's right here, and y'all catch up, I move fast like light years
Now it's back to the basics
K. Dot's nothing to play with
A nigga tried to test my gangsta
I pulled out a weapon and aced it
My grade point average at the top of the brackets
I'm sick like a cancer patient
Assist many players like personal agent
Y'all as foul, clothes to fragrance
I'm the best now
Plus the kid married to rap, old cats need to renew ya vows
Sit down, practice your verbs and nouns
'Cause I'm on the verge to progressin' my words
I'm the best you heard today, hands down
So hand down whatever you had
Like you been in a bag
Put it in garbage or trash, I'm the best you had
Ever since, oh yeah, intelligence
K. Dot, so heaven sent
Vulgarity is - the only heir apparent to the throne
Young and I'm ions beyond the box
Flow free on, but still will Ghost Recon a cop
So phenomenal by design, we still pushing the envelope
No keyage to vote, but uh, most agree I am hope for the coast
Low key I'm consulting the triage of folks
On me I'm the most slept on
Stepped on, step songs, father of rap songs
Writing my wrongs, writing the book of psalms
This is the word, word to the Holy Quran
Or whatever that's foreign to you
I find it funny that you embracing the storm
Wake up, ring the alarm
Or wake up with a bomb through ya
Its Baghdad, kids with bad dads
Cops with bad badges
Big bullets, no "my bad"'s when them guns shoot you
Mykestro, I might go out as the Mike Jordan
Lacing my Jordans and yelling out ISO
Ike Turner your idol, whip him and bruise him
Stick poison inside of his pipe-hole, sad that you knew him
We influence the heart of thousands
That's nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand but who's counting
Thirsty for success and we drink from the youth fountain
Big-headed tryna stay grounded like a delinquent in middle school clowning
Drowning MCs, they want life jackets
While we swim backwards, we yellin' "nigga please!"
Pay your respect and recognize the alphabet
You can't survive in a room full of Gs
Coached by my Uncle Lil' Mane, I resemble him
They tryna steal the game, and we killing all thieves
Make them draw blood, let them all bleed
Motherfucker die, put a ribbon in the sky, tell Stevie Wonder sing
King of all kings, Joker and new jacks will get dealt with
Royal flush when I drop shit and say these things
Man I lean on them cause half these niggas Maybelline: all made up
I'm about to go dummy on a dummy what-what
Treat some like welterweights stuff in some trunks
Fucking with a giant, I'm Forest Whitaker sparring with some Forest Gumps
What you want!
I encourage infamy, you get an empty me and turn
I return before tables get turned
It’s my turn, spur of the moment
I re-produce my sperm and try to clone it, stand firm
Bumping The Firm, Phone Tap, I’m on it
I slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent
You can’t fuck with the horse power, your woofing too much
Y’all bout to hoarse coward, as soon as I buss, pause
You put your hands on a broad and telling me you can brawl
You thought you saw me when you saw Saw, frightening
More reckless than a paisa driving without a license
Hittin’ your new truck then leaving you hiking
They said no, the industry let it go
I cracked the window then hit the back door like trick dices
Stickin’ and movin and movin’ and stickin’ the prices
Uppin’ the ante before I'm a antique, can promise you hear me clear
Even if you eat 3 ears with Tyson
Rippin’ the panties but bootin’ the wammys
They dyke and I’m liking them all, I’m siftin’ through panties
Haters’ll spike it
Voicing opinions but holding laryngitis
See I don’t hear ‘em, I’m a winner by law
Track em down like the subway when they sub-par
Sub-zero everytime I jump in the synagogues
Send the angels, send the God
I can make you look hard, I know
I just let the thoughts take its toll
More sentences than level four yard, Bogard
Go hard, black tar, concrete, Tom Vick times Papi Mason times 3
Uncle Toms need Tums to stomach atomic bombs
Or die from my Wizardry
RZA, GZA, Method Man
I’m a Killer Bee, killer! Be killed, make your embassy yield
This is not your cup of tea, and oh
They say waters run deep, dive in, Bermuda triangles
And you will see us, we must leave dust behind
Emcee’s duck, deduct, revenue declined
When we touch down like a Running Back’s grind
Can you keep up or keep away for keepsake
We must leave dust behind
Emcee’s duck, deduct, revenue declined
When we touch down like a Running Back’s grind
Can you keep up, you keep a safe for keepsake
That ain't safe - Bluh!
Watch how I kill 'em with the funky rhythm
Rappers I babysit 'em like soap operas they are my children
You dealing with the most phenomenon
My style raw like Madonna on, PCP
B-I-G, Frank White used to rock hand me down air nikes
Now I style proper, i gotta
Be laced in linen that's Versace
Polo fleeces, my bitches in Vicky secrets
Dom Perignon to carry on the festivities
Cristal when the sun go down
Anybody wanna touch me, the gun go "blaow"
It gets ugly, like New York momma, who want drama?
Biggie drop bombs like Osama, my bank account
What can i say? comma comma, comma
Kami-kaze, snap shots at you like papparazzi
Definition, Junior Mafia, ?
I don't worry bout' none of you rappers
Most of y'all talking practice, actors like Denzel
Until you trapped in a lion den with stake
Under your chin, oh well, shouldn't play with Big Poppa
357 over my boxers
Magnum, tell the doctor I shot ya, ugh
Toe tag 'em, crack with purple tops, we bag 'em
House licks, we ski mask 'em, baby baby
Oh hey
Oh, oh hey
Oh, oh, oh hey
Uh oh, uh oh
No more “please stop”
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, woah
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do
And I swear this shit feel like my birthday
Hub City my birthplace uh
You'd rather roll over than live in a blizzard, or die in an earthquake
This could be a catastrophe, no one got the audacity
To show blasphemy, to the god of rap, nigga I go back like an artifact
And I got my weight up, all is fat is brought to you by
Kendrick and the all-mighty eye, HiiiPower
And I tower, over y'all like I'm 12 feet tall, every hour
I'm real fast, supersonic
Brace yourself, orthodontics
Orthopedics, I collect, your bones, if I need it
Mars Venus, that's the planets, I go to when I wanna be organic
Earth place too fake ha touche
Unguarded every time you pump fake uh
Pump brakes uh, nah, never that can't (?) wait nah
I'm living by the G-code nah mean, killin' rappers 'til they break uh
None, of, y'all, ball, like, I, do, every time I slide through
My pimpin' just remind you that
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, ohhh
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do
Peep the style and the way the cops sweat us
Artillery got a gun for every letter
In the alphabet while your family in pajama's
I'll be stepping in your house like Alpha Beta Gamma
I’m creeping
Got a dorm something decent
V12 stock engine (yeah)
Don’t worry he’ll be dead in a minute
59 seconds past then I let them shots blast
And I do it quicker than a horny 8 grey class
And sit them in the water like Alcatraz
Don’t bother with the god mc

What are you doing, respect you more if you called it a truce
But we burn white flags, so its probably no use
They tell me we hot, I’m looking like who?
Probably in heaven is the only time you couldn’t show me some proof
Until then keep stepping’ while I act a animal in the booth
You looking at the one man sitting zoo, Pity the fool thats denying the truth

Hop out with two of them Top Models
Haters gon' hate, but before the ice grill, say, 'Stop
Look at my motherfuckin' wheels'
They'll say it's bizack for the first time
Young boy rhyme like '87 Rakim, locked in my own world
No fire hydrant can water down me though
I'm a tyrant on Swizz beats, it's kind of ironic
Roll up the chronic tree, Hennessy, let's see, can you get like me?
White tee, L.A. fitted, roamin' the backstreet
Back trunk, chopper clap back at me
Girls get skeet-skeet on like Little John
BME, I don't save 'em, even with coupons
Usually I kick game like modern-day Bruce Lee
Raw heat, never paranoid when ridin' on deep-dish rims
Fly as Clark Kent, invade the black like a martian
Then say, 'Pardon me, no, pardon my arrogance
If you don't learnt else about I
Then, motherfucker, you better know this'
On my momma, you want to look at my wheels, huh?

Or look at me, look at my motherfuckin' wheels
I ain't gon' lie 'bout it
Jay Rock, K. Dot
Watts City finest, and the Hub City threat
LB I see you my nigga
Let's go
With past of Trinidad
When I walk back, more vicious than wildcats
I would have swallowed that
Nickerson Garden projects gain the profit
Of my lyrical content
Build a monument
Gotta put a clip to your conscience
Watch this, pull up on your block in a stick-shift
Pop six, watch you fall just from the fifth hit
The spliff lit, when I'm high can't I spit sick
Got the mind of a chief, the heart of a soldier
With a rifle got a hell of a range like rover
And the fight, got a hell of a strike like vipers
When the gat, got a hell of a aim like snipers
Since VapoRubs mom's got my Nyquizzle
I was just a scrub now it's all about the bizzles
Trying to make a buck slinging weed and E pizzles
My nigga hit me up, and as far the stizzle
I'll eat your ass up show you how a bullet fizzle
Get your ass touched one hand on your whizzle
The other on the clutch, my middle finger up
Shit I'm not giving a fuck
Catch me on Rosecrans and Central leanin' like I'm supposed to
My brain is mental a nigga stay focused
Plus I'm in the hood with the hood rats and roaches
Caught crack, and served a three-fifth on my culture
Desert Eagle on me these niggas acting like vultures
I ain't dying homie I swear that your thoughts is bogus
Keep the iron on me I'll crease you flat if you approach us
Acting how you act you gone get some out of that holster
I do it by myself, with a hook and an uppercut
Doctor got a stitch you up
Nigga are you real or what
I'm a little guy but I'm tough
I hit hard then I'm natural
You a dead man when my gat bust
If you running nigga better run a little faster
These bullets like Heinz oh yeah they'll catch ya
Let me tell y’all something
I seen this bitch right she fine than a motherfucker I ain’t gone lie straight up
I take her home though, fucked and got off, pitbull type
Now do I love them hoes, hell no
Take her to the swap meet before Melrose
Benihana, more like like Top Ramen noodles
Champagne no sweet Kool-Aid made by Sherane
Send her back to her boyfriend with cum stains
I redesign bitches wardrobe
All I do is make up something then sit it between her earlobes
She thinking no one ever invented clothes
Used to hide the camera in the closet
Now I’m like I’m doing you a favor to fuck you bitch pose
They don’t even want to go to award shows
They just wanna award me with hoes
Put em on a track like vocals
Leave em for a day and they want their master back like the first album by Jay
I dash with the dividends no shit if Big Pimpin is a sin then I rather not repent (preach)
Girl on the phone
You know I need my master back like Jay Z first album
Okay I got this one girl her name is tity pop her name is what?
Her name is tiny pop I met her at USC she’s a good girl
Yeah
Punch what's happening brother?
Niggas be poppin' that shit to me like it's something new to me or something, I tell 'em bout
I tell a nigga quick, that shit just a rerun to me nigga
Antonio what's happening with it?
Niggas hatin' on me but hop right on my dick soon as they see me
Soon as they see me they be like
What up Dot?
That's what they tell me every second around the clock
Every time I clock in, rappers checking they watch
Studio paid for, hours unlimited
Assholes, how many MCs I knock off they payroll
How many God MCs I knock off they halo
Hip-hop ain't dead, consumers changed up
Rappers love to see gold like the end of a rainbow
I stay low like my socks under my ankles
Play the back like a turtle shell, know well
That my team got me if I ever slack on my shit
So I fail, guess what? I don't even trip
Just like that, crush your little battle raps, punchlines
I did that in 99' you think it's a gold mine
When you think of one, you think you hot but I think you done
Like Queens New York slang, look what the killer brung
Machine guns to a fight, fucking right
Pay your bills or I'm turning out your lights, good night
I shatter niggas dreams, thinking they the West Coast kings
'Till I drop like visine
Tell a nigga quick it ain't always what it seems
Like the stitching on swap meet jeans
I'm itching to scratch a whack rapper, gun clapper
Snuff him like a rude capper, got a cool bladder, but I'm pissed off
At ya
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, (are you not entertained?)
Body any nigga that wanna holla' my name
And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up
Nigga said he'd snatch my chain in the streets, what chain?
I barely wear jewelry, so I ever had one
You barely see it on me, and if I ever had a gun
You wouldn't know it's on me, so snatch it and then you done
I'm in the studio just sipping on Parmesan
Thinking about who could fuck with Kenny and parlor sons
I live this shit, try stop me, you won't live to shit
Probably catch four between your abdomen
Next time you see me, don't ask me who I'm collabing with
Between me and you, some of the new West is actresses
New hate activists, lowkey can't stand our shit
But still we continue to drink laxatives
Cold blooded, make the label hand me your budget
This is mine don't touch (pow pow), did I stutter?
Catch two, cats knew, I been a gorilla, welcome to the zoo
Yup, you little monkeys know what it do
Come test me
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, (are you not entertained?)
Body any nigga that wanna holla' my name
And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up
Dayum, you killin' 'em K-Dizzle
And if you don't kill 'em then you send 'em to hospitals
Sleeping on a reclined bed with a thin pillow
I'm with a white bitch, ass like a black widow
Bet I jumble to the end of my lifeline
So when I die, you can say I balled for a long time
The 08' Frankenstein, beast like Sasquatch
Feet size thirty-six, steppin on Hip-Hop cause that's my bitch
I write a rhyme, then she ride my dick
The girl is mine, I don't know that hoe that you with
You niggas know this, I'm way better than I've ever been
So focused, like a sniper when he zoom in
What's your motives? I bet it's to go against
Or like the GT get your bitch ass bit, all on these streets
I'm the all mighty K, Compton
Rep it 'till my very death day, let the reaper in his face
And recite every song from N.W.A
I pay homage for those great who paved the way
Wait, back to the subject of who's and who doesn't
Do what I do, bluffin' until I touch 'em
Like a masseuse do, nothing compares to me
But the throne, so tell 'em bring the chair to me
I'm a red bullet, small nigga
But I handle y'all niggas like I'm eight feet tall
Nigga
It's Alive
Now I done grew up 'round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me
I rap with a Pyrex
In the projects
I'm crack in a pot
I'm a prospect
I'm a pirate
On a dock full of dope
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You can not test no key in a Tesla
Bitch, I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras, ah
I been a real one, I been a real one
I been a real one, I been a real one
I been a- I been a love and a travesty
Never talk down on no prophecy, put it on God, ain't no stopping me
Put it on God, God, God, God, God
I been a real one, I been a real one
I been a real one, I been a real one
I been a real one, I been a-
I been a love and a travesty, never talk down on no prophecy
Put it on God, ain't no stopping me, put it on God, God, God, God
Welcome to the story of my life, Miseducation of Kendrick
Stressin', Hennessy shots, throw 'em back like it's vintage
Wondering "can I live?" Where is the generosity?
Something just gotta give, tryna stay positive
My mode is to be a mogul
Searching for a dollar without compromising my vocals
Really I'm just a noble
Kid from the west side of Compton
My cousins was selling crack, while I played Sonic
You say that you grinding, you niggas is full of shit
And might need a Heimlich
Maneuver to throw up what you consume
My shine is bright enough to make a dead flower bloom
In a room full of curtains
I'm for certain that I'm certainly popping a pistol verbally
And never will I get shot, ya aim is all fucked up
As if a Sidekick dropped
I'm nice wit it, bro-bro
My peeps depending on me, we be where the stove go
Let's eat
I said be grateful and give some thanks
And he said "man, for what?"
I been outta my luck cuz I been stuck
And plus I'm broke as fuck
So shut up and pack it up or take it elsewhere
Get a nigga off this welfare, with some healthcare
Can you help there?
He thought he deserved and had the nerve to kick the blame to me
But strange to see how it came to be
This game just ain't the same to me
And I ain't gon' sympathize or look in his eyes
And tell no lies
So I said "FUCK WHAT YOU HEARD
THE TRUTH BURNS, BETTER RECOGNIZE"
We have yet to see....
Where these roads will lead
So we take what we want
And give thanks when we receive
We have yet to see
Tomorrow may not be
So we take what we want
And give thanks when we receive
Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Lord, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't really care and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, with no amenities, I'm gettin' better with time
Yeah!
Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time, can you
Hey
Can you feel me with time
Oh
Can you feel me with time, can you
Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time
Radioactive, radioactive
I'm lookin' at the flashy lights and wonder - the price and number
Enticed by the glamorous ice, I wanna
Unite with the Hollywood twice, my concert, 'll look like yours
And I wanted more than I could ever imagine even a kicked-down door
So you can hear that I'm rapping, see, I can hear "encore"
Struck by the fame bug, been fightin' the same drug
The feelin' that caned us in vain, it's tough love
Please help me, please help me
I'm on my knees, please help me, need you to tell me
Ain't nothing' bigger than you, I thought a Benz would do
But nothin' bigger than you, ain't nothin' bigger than truth
And truth be told, the totem pole
Of non-believers just made the cattle blow
But I can see ya, even when my vision's impaired
You're many moons away, but still you're right here
And you niggas is borderline bitches
That’s my opinion
And my niggas is ride or die Aftermath my religion
Talk out but I don’t listen
Act out and come up missing
That click clack pow did it
Like Colin Powell did it
And I’m so west coast, ok corral with it
My new foreign car can't pronounce that shit
You fuck around…count that shit
Broadcasting live from Compton California where foreigners never come
Mothers are worrisome and we dislike the governor
I hope these angels can cover us
If the LAPD ain’t doing it then it was a cover up
Coroners about to cover up everybody
I’m serious, every shotty is saw'd off
And every nigga is militant
And your gut like...What?
EBT Cards, no credit can't ease cards
All my life beed OG aw now my life on the billboard soon
Give me room, I react like a wildebeest and
Throw salt inside your wound your just diabetes to me
Ain't shit sweet with these hotels homie
That crip shit got my uncle’s life in jail ho
So if I put the same line, they'll never forgive me
Or worse than that the niggas right around the corner might kill me
I’m fighting back when it’s hard what
No barber my guards up, the author of fallen fathers that did it without much, this my house nigga
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking street
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking street
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
Queen Kunta, everybody wanna and get somethin'
Kunta, black man taking no losses
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
Queen Kunta, everybody wanna and get somethin'
Kunta, black woman taking no losses
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be (ohh yeah)
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you nappy-headed motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
The yam is the power that be
How Long you been Banging?
I been banging sense 85
On the real this shit ain't no gimmick
Or no game my nigga! this hit is real live
Thruthful type shit my nigga!
You know what im saying?
On the real my nigga!
And I lost a lot of real niggas to this hit
Kill kill kill, murder murder murder 8x
Killa cali you can try you can die motherfucker!
Killa cali you can try you can die motherfucker!
Compton Shit! Yeah! Dope Boy I fuck with you nigga!
Uh, fuck em all, kill 'em all off
Sent 'em off to the Holy One
Put a hole in one like miniature golf
You doubled your profit?
Well I see triple like Ricky Ross
Hand over the cloth, cloth over gun
Gun over your jaw, bullet over your tongue
Stick my dick inside hip hop and shorty sprung
Every time I get a chance to cum over I overcome
Over the snare drum
Say who fucking with you if you the God MC?
I tell em nun! Get it? I tell em Nun
Catholic nor a Christian, holding the book of sums
In back of my true religions
From the murder capitol niggas cap at your neighbors
And never tell you who did it
Aiming for your grill like a dentist working on British
Teeth if you speak get shot in the mouth bitches
Its like that sent shots at a crip or a blood or an Essay
Bet they coming right back....RIGHT?
We Get High
Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac
In his prime, thug life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscing when the LA Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickriding, I'm addicted to
Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
"Compton!", a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit, now everybody sing that shit
Ride like it's four wheel drive (Ride)
Ride till we forklift the tires (Ride)
Ride and we never get tired, ride on our enemies
Crime chemistry got me hemorrhaging blood out my memory
I'm Ted Bundy if the money exist (Ah, nah)
Al Bundy 'cause my other hand is gripping my dick, ain't nothing funny, bitch
Monopolize my prophecy, they watching me thru binoculars
Obviously, bitch, I'm Pac in these Wallabees
Wanna-be's wanna be me, take one of these then take it easy
The Lord wants you and Forbes list need me
Lord forgive me for my ways, I blame it on how I was raised
Inside of a cage, praying with slaves
Compton, California, the coroner work for seven days
Throughout the week, you might as well leap yourself to a grave
Lunges out a bottomless pit, bottles of Hennessy
Guzzle another fifth, pop a pill then pop in the clip
Pop a shot then circle the block, then you just repeat it again
Ammo, reincarnated, Rambo, now tell a friend, motherfucker
(Ayy, let me hear that ho, Jeff)
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear (Cardo got wings)
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Ayy
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Ayy
Park him on the spot, park him if he say he hot
Park him while his friends watch
I am everything you not
They say shame on me, I got the underground on lock
That's what hoes say, that's what the bros say
I tell a freak bitch, "Baby, let's roleplay"
I like the kinks bitch, fuck me 'til the OJs
I mean my chain a woo-sah, I mean my game a woo-sah
I want some head in my new car, bitch, I don't care who drive by
You know I could make you famous
You know life bring changes
Shit, I changed locations soon as that big bag came in
That's a mighty fine ass you got
Thought I forgot?
I can make the play and cash it out
Thought I forgot? Whoa
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear (Cardo got wings)
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Ayy
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Ayy
Yo like I was sayin' though, I pull up to the chick house
Nigga be like straight cartoon characters (What?)
No doubt, tasmanian devil
Aye, aye, aye man, aye
You that dude K. Dot, man? (Yo)
Yeah, yeah man, I heard you from like Compton (Yeah)
Like CPT, like deep in there, like in the streets
Hol' up, hol' up, who is y'all?
Man, I'm Johnny Goodfor, and I'm from Wisconsin
But my man here, he spit that hot fire, you need to hear this, he got that piff
Where you from?
That's that piff
I'm Deran, nigga, D3 is from the east coast, homie
What part of the east coast?
Nigga I'm from Maine

Man, imma get these cars, get these cars
Imma spit these bars, spit these bars
Wait, hol' up, is you serious?
Man, I ain't playin', this nigga's real, man
{Random Guy & Random Rapper}
(Hushed murmuring)
I'm the truth!
Tell these- tell these fools
I'm tellin' 'em
These Cali ass niggas
Cali, Bali
We go to valleys
Damn industry niggas
Oooh, nani nani
Come on… She wanna roll…
Catch me in the cut with a cup of the juice
I’m chilling, believe this, I’m Jesus to women
They all want to jump in my coupe like a pigeon
Smokey on Friday, find me on the highway
Middle finger up, not giving a fuck
Like a nun who masturbates, congratulate
See, my style is a cast of
Goldie Mack, super fly, Bumpy Johnson
Holding my Johnson when you jump on my dick
Because haters always like to jump in the mix
Say they can dress but always throwing a fit
They must know I got cream when I’m pushing the whip
That’s whip cream, use your common sense when listening
I strike gold when I roll like a pirate
Soulo won’t you call T-Mobile and play the sidekick
I’m number one…
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz…
And you ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz..
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz…
And you ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz..
No hay nadie rezando por mí
(No hay nadie rezando por mí)
(No hay nadie rezando por mí)
No hay nadie rezando por mí
(Nadie reza por mi)
No hay nadie rezando por mí
(No hay nadie rezando por mí)
(Nadie reza por mi)
Me siento como un chip en mis hombros
Me siento como que estoy perdiendo mi enfoque
Me siento como que estoy perdiendo mi paciencia
Me siento como mis pensamientos en el sótano
Me siento, siento que estás mal educado
Siento que no quiero que me molesten
Siento que tú puedes ser el problema
Siento que no es mañana, a la mierda el mundo
El mundo se está acabando, he terminado de fingir
Y vete a la mierda si te ofendes
Me siento como amigos sobrevalorados
Me siento que la familia que ha estado fingiendo
Siento que los sentimientos están cambiando
Siento que mi pensamiento de compromiso está cansado
Siento que quieres averiguar cómo lo hice
Siento que no los estoy sintiendo a todos
Tengo ganas de retirarme, sin sentimientos involucrados
Lo siento por ti, he estado en el campo por ti
Es real para ti, ¿verdad? Mierda, me siento como—
No hay nadie rezando por mí
No hay nadie rezando por mí
No hay nadie rezando por mí
No hay nadie rezando
Siento negros fuera de bolsillo
Siento negros tocando los bolsillos
Tengo ganas de debatir sobre quién es el mejor que puede detenerlo
Soy leyenda, siento que todos ustedes son campesinos
Siento que todos ustedes están desesperados
Siento que todo lo que se necesita es un segundo para sentirse igual
Mike Jordan cada vez que sostiene un micrófono real
No siento tu presencia
Siento que te estoy aprendiendo una lección
Siento solo yo y la música aunque
Siento que tu sentimiento no es mutuo
Siento como el enemigo que debes saber
Siente como el sentimiento de no esperanza
El sentimiento de mala droga
Un cuarto de onza manipulada de jabón
El sentimiento, el sentimiento de la libertad falsa
Les daré de comer el veneno que los llena en la prisión
Siento que soy solo yo
Mira, siento que no puedo respirar
Mira, siento que no puedo dormir
Mira, me siento sin corazón, a menudo fuera de esto
El sentimiento de caer, de desmoronarse con
Las horas más oscuras, lo perdí
Llenando el vacío de ser empleado con dinero
Las calles están hablando, llena los espacios en blanco con ataúdes
Llena los bancos con dólares
Llena las tumbas con padres
Llena a los bebés con mierda
Blogs de internet y púlpito, rellenalos con chismes
Siento que esto tiene que ser el sentimiento donde estaba 'Pac
El sentimiento de un apocalipsis sucediendo
Pero nada es incómodo, el sentimiento no prosperará
El sentimiento es tóxico, siento que estoy boxeando demonios
Monstruos, falsos profetas intrigantes
Patrocinadores, promesas de la industria
Negros, perras, blancos, hackers, Compton
Iglesia, religión, "negros que crean diversidad en medios" en esclavitud
Visitas judiciales, citación servida en concierto
A la mierda tus sentimientos, lo digo por impostores
Puedo sentirlo, el fénix seguro de mirarnos
Puedo sentirlo, el sueño es más que un proceso
Puedo poner un régimen que forma el Lago Ness
Puedo sentirlo, el grito que atormenta nuestra lógica
Tengo ganas de decir algo, tengo ganas de tomar algo
Tengo ganas de patinar, tengo ganas de esperarlos
Tal vez sea demasiado tarde para ellos
Siento que todo el mundo quiere que ore por ellos
¿Pero quién carajo reza por mí?
No hay nadie rezando por mí
¿Quién reza por mí?
No hay nadie rezando
This hunter is aiming straight at your head, niggas doubt me
Tell em' they better count me in, like Dracula
Packing a black mack in the back of a magnum
You rappers is gon' go
That's one hell of a punch line but let's get back to the flow
Left jab hit your nose
Right hook fracture your skull
Your body is free
Put luxury tax on your soul (OG)
That's what they yelling when I'm pulling up
Like a rough rider working out in the hood and stuff
They say I ain't in the hood enough?
Bitch I'm a transmission
The pump leak when your oil slipping
And I been in the kitchen, like a toaster
With them toasters, hang you like a Willie Lynch poster
East side vulture, preying on your dead caracas
Sorry I was starving
Straight from the Pyrex pot
I'm a crack rock wait
Grab the A1 sauce let's raise the stakes
Catastrophic K.Dot
Currently stacking currency
Bet I make profits like I'm God
Every instrumental get dealt with
Burnt and melted
Jump in the water
Jaws is ready to eat you selfish
I'm cold hearted
That's for sure
Talk shit like a nigga farted
But the smell came out the other hole
(Yuck)
Hol' up, big truck
Lurking the premises
Pull up, hoes rubbing they clitoris
What the fuck?
This is K.Dot, they pray I
Fall like a jump shot
From they favorite player
With seconds on the clock
(Yep)
Im here to souffle ya'
Turn rappers into
Anything barbecued
They're miniature party food
I get spizzy
Like I'm Hugh Hef "Come fuck with me"
One first tonight
Might change your life, right?
Yeah, I like it
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
I can hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now
I can't handle no liquor
And these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my bitches
And my bitches they can't control me
You say you know me, my wishes
But you really just know the old me
Bitch, I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
"Baby girl, he's a loner"
"Baby girl, he's a loner"
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
"When it's over it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma
I've been known to flip on niggas, spaz on bitches
One state of mind, I'm out for the riches
I've seen good crack, uncle stuck in the kitchen
Now behind prison, phone calls can't visit
Seventeen, half of my life has been explicit
Rated R content, no supervision
With you talking nonsense, I'm not trynna listen
I'm a point guard, small forward, play your position
Before you wind up in the lake with the fishes
On a blind date with a crocodile, vicious
I switch the flow so you say that I sound different
But the flow is the same reason my dick kill bitch kissing??
And that's the same reason your not in my competition
Cause I swear right now that none of yall existing
Fall off is probably what you wishing
But I can't stop, won't stop, young gunning you niggas
I've been known to have stash for the burnnin
And break a bitch down to the point that I learn them
And when I get dough, I'mma let you know, throw the cake in your face like Ike Turner
I turn a schoolgirl into a dick smuggler, sex publisher, rated X government
See me in the hooptie boy, it's not a cover up
See I'm a young black boy who don't give a fuck, what
This that gangsta shit that make you wanna grab your shit
Cock back and blast some shit
Empty, reload the clip
You won't find nothing hotter than this
Whatcha know about it
This that gangsta shit that make you wanna blaze this spliff
Get drunk, grab a fifth, open it, guzzle it quick
You won't find nothing hotter than this
Whatcha know about it
Kendrick Lamar, I'm bout to get my mop stick
Niggas bump their gums, and their bitches be bumping my shit
I fry your optics, if you watching my style, watch it
Tyrannosaurus reading thesaurus, hold rappers hostage
Catastrophic, it's 9-11 when I'm repping
Skip college to fly first class, learn a lesson
Straight brutal, roman numerals
Number one eating Ramen noodles, rhyming crucial under the sun
Kudos to the most high, which is me
I probably make 'em plan their suicide, so usually
I ain't never been with the shit starting, but y'all done started some shit
I'm 'bout to drink some ex-lax then commence
To returning the favor to all of my neighbors and comrades
Calm down, you more like Trina than Trinidad, let's box now
Throw your dukes up
Pussy probably holding Daisy Dukes and C-cups
I look inside this industry and I don't see much
I just see lunch, and your shit that's more bore like tourists
I'm laid back, my feet up, how cool is that?
The twenty-ten Kool G. Rap, whenever I rap
I got my arsenal strapped on my back, I'm ready for war
They tend to look for me when they fiend for Afeni Shakur
Conversing, not hibernating, under the planet core
At thirteen I cancelled PG-13 and went for gore
That's what I pledge
It's profound that I'm underground touching 'mainstreams' like river beds
Pamona pimpin when im sippin that hard liquor
Hit the studio with mo cuts than a cold sensor
Nigga what, im a west coast predator
Pteradactyl when i sink my teeth in the beat
Got a lock like Armostol? shakles around her feet
Glock in my right palm got my strong arm steady like kwali
Make it hard for you to get by the silencer is so serene
Sound like a california ocean breeze, no lie
Speaking of a bitch these hoes is no joke
Tell a story any chance they get
Where my money at? She talking bout she broke
Now I can dig in her left pocket
Dig in her right pocket, dig in her back pocket
Pull money out of all three and still swear up and down that she don't got it
You better hop up on the track and put that pussy to use
Now, I oughta go upside your motherfucking wig
But you lucky your little boy called the police on me the last time I hit you
In front of yo' kid
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
Kendrick, and I wear pendant on my shoulder
Soldier, like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted, got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down, knowin' damn well
We don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar
'Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin' when the L.A. Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickridin'
I'm addicted to Westsidin'
Livin' in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
Tryin', try-tryn', tryn'...
So they looking for me
They don't know
I'm waiting on them
Right here, I'ma sit by the window
See they gonna have to get me
Yeah, they gonna have to get me
Come get me
Damn shame, why do they let me get a champagne, uh
Blood stain saw all over his black ring, uh
Hm, I'm surprise
Ya'll not here yet
Plans must have change
But I'm still here
I even let the backdoor open
Come on now
So ya'll still ain't here
So I guess there's a first time for everything if ya'll don't come
But I'm still here
In fact I'm still waiting for someone else
Punch
I'm restless know
Ya'll took to long
Maybe next time
Or maybe even I come to you
Hm, but for know
Kendrick Lamar young nigga
Before I ever wear a chain I make sure you know my name
I'm the same good kid from the block where you was raised
Didn't have a pot to piss in peeing in your pj's
You see my story is a story untold by the kid from Compton making straight a's for new clothes
Surrounded by bullets from one of my relatives foes
Because he been a killer since he was 12 years old
The price of being guilty by association got me places I ain't ever been
Like in back of the swap meet niggas trynna test my chin
Squaring up like a nerd before summer school begin
Then break when bullets breaks wind
All I wanna do is rap
But it's a wrap
When you living inside of Iraq and
George Bush in the quote of sack
You get pushed and you righteous act
It's a murder charge on your back
Can I captivate this captive before you try peel my cap
Can I live
Huh
Kendrick Lamar
Little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
What'cha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
K-Dot, Kendrick Lamar, got mad heart
Come from Compton, I spit straight heart
Got my hood on for Trayvon Martin
Freedom, justice, you know we gon' be started
Get the party started every time we come through flippin'
Flamin' Hot Cheetos I'm eatin'
I'm skippin' across L.A., that's somethin' that we do
Each and every day, hangin' with my crew
Throw another word, watch how I observe the train
Matter of face, where's my girl, Sherane
And when I say "train", that don't means that I flip her
Yeah, we did toss, turn just like Flipper
My favorite cartoon, you know
Got to go with Bugs Bunny Cartoon Show
Tiny Toon Adventures, Dennis the Menace
I'm a menace, I spit, break the World of Guinness
When I'm flowin', you never know, I need another word
Give me nouns and verbs, what I spit is absurd
The Finals, the Heat, yeah, they came with the Heat
LeBron, Wade, no, they can't be defeat
I stay in the shade, I'm in the darkness, I'm hot though
Another word, homie, you give me what you got
Who kills my vibe? The haters, the groupies
The Hoovers in the streets, they try to shoot me
I move with heat, you never can stop me
I come from Compton, (?)
The best strip club, it's down Atlanta, it's down Miami
I stay with the (?), I say, "What's up, shawty?"
You got your girl, I don't like fake ass, I need a referral
I see everybody twerkin'
Even Miley Cyrus got that motherfucker workin'
You can never stop me, The Rickey Smiley Show
I'm here, I'm here, I'm lettin' people know
The better celebrity female in the game
I like Rihanna, who else could complain?
I love, I can't even say the word
But I'm cussin' and I don't need to pronounce a verb
The Black Hippy is the crew, we do what we do
We stay in the booth, we do it, we shoot
We straight for the stars, you know just who we ares
We ride in Buicks, then we pushin' the flashy cars
I'm a flow all day, this The Rickey Smiley Show
Just to let you know, we still 'bout to go
They bring me in, they show love with the crew
Rickey Smiley Show, huh, you know what it do, what's up?
...wonder if there's only a frame
It's what's inside, that heart following love in those veins
I still see Johnny...
My little brotha, we evolve, we evolve like
I've spit that wonder rhymin' shit since thirteen
Uh, motherfucker, I been rhymin' it, it's timin', kid
That's all it's 'bout in this life
If you want to jump in this game, then think twice
Curly-haired nigga, nappy-head flows
Remember eighth grade, I started gettin' all my hoes
Started rockin' all these shows, jumpin' on stages
Readin' in rap books, flipped so many pages
Flipped so many stages in my life
I must admit, I've always been the shit
With the written or the freestyle, a nigga been wild
Get free shoes for my nigga Q now
He say, 'Wait, get anythin' that's important'
Exclusive shit, not the shit Wade be rockin'
Cat with them big-ass jerseys and fake Js
Some shit in the barber shop
(Uh, nah, like, I ain't been to the barber shop, nigga
Who's takin' my shit to the barber shop?)
Nigga, I'll gets you owned now
I guess everybody know your songs now
(Now, now I can give you free shoes)
Shoes, uh-huh, uh (I can give you free shoes)
Yo, you gettin' free shoes
How many raps have I wrote?
How many words that I spoke?
How many shit I jot in jail just for others to quote?
That's what my man just brought up
I'm thinkin' 'bout this industry, I'm all caught up
I can't get out, I'm like Charlotte's Web
Lookin' at my shit, can download it on the Web
I'm so confused with these tools
Recycled other dudes
I'm talkin' the greatest, I'm talkin' about legends
I'm talkin' 'bout your rhymes, that shit is half-steppin'
That shit is mad depressin', I'm tryin' to enlighten the city
I'm tryin' to get all the hoes to get with me
Rap, is it really worth it?
Should I keep doin' it on purpose
Should I jump in the booth? I used to get nervous
But now I'm just the truth like the motherfuckin' Bible
Tabernacle, spin around twice
Shondo, you tell me that I'm nice, yeah
But I just already sat on it
(Oh, yeah, and I got that for free too
Yeah, Q, what it do?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch
These niggas teed out here, my nigga
These niggas teed out here, bitch
You niggas teed out here, bitch
You niggas teed out here, bitch
You niggas teed out here
Swisher, I give a fuck, never miss you, I'd kiss you
Never cool as the bitch, I'm the shit, give a fuck
Fucked up and I still rip it up
Yeah, niggas walkin' in with choppers and I don't know
They act like it's a camera
Shootin' everybody on the floor
See, he got the army jeans on
This nigga finna get his beam on
Tryin' to wear a beanie like me
Motherfuckin' plaid motherfuckin' shirts
Old-ass Jordans and shit
I'd put y'all up on some free motherfuckin' shoes
Big-ass bomber coat like you from New York
Go outside and smoke them cheap-ass Newports
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
It's a secret garden in my mind
Flower child
When the lights get low and you notice I am the sun
The winter time was snow but only little you know
I will still breathe, give me the keys
I'm resuscitating the game, see me in CPR
My name is a gun cocked, gun shot
Dead and I won't stop
Gun cocked, gun shot
Head in a pine box
With a dozen roses, hold this with a gift card
Gun cocked, gun shot
Flowers on your momma's yard
K. Dot, got this fiend saying, Baby
Man we got that got shit over there
Watts finest, and the Hub City's threat, lets go
If you want us come see us
Backdoor procedures
We got what you need
As our profit increases
Walking from Centennial, going home like
Straight down Central, got banged on
I ain't even have the pistol
If death was the issue
This shit, I guess it will be a sad song
So I'm thinking to myself like down
They bust a u-turn, so I know I'm goin'
I ain't no bitch or nothing
But if they just start jumping
I got no heat, so fuck it, I'ma start running
Before them shots come flying
Call my nigga Ralo like
Hold a nigga (down)
He ain't had no minutes
So a nigga just hopping fences
But if I do get popped, I hope he'll be a witness
But luckily he turned around
I got home like safe and sound
Now I'm back to the block
Stay ducking them cops
Cause you know they will lock a nigga
For them small grams, or them pounds
But they won't stop my profit
Or get in my pockets
(Even if it means a nigga gotta) sell narcotics
(We gonna hold shit)
(Open up shop across) town
Cause we gonna get this cream
No matter how hard it seems
We gonna do it together see were a team
(Rock)
If you want some you can get some
We can do it with the small or the big guns
Bout Whatever and whenever you want to do with this war shit we used to it
Lets get it on
Down central
Eyes in my rearview cause you never know who’s out to kill you
Lookout, lookout, lookout, lookout, lookout yeah
If you want some you can get some
We can do it with the small or the big guns
(yeah) Bout Whatever and whenever you want to do with this war shit we used to it
Lets get it on
If you want some you can get some
We can do it with the small or the big guns
(yeah) Bout Whatever and whenever you want to do with this war shit we used to it
Lets get it on
Down central
Eyes in my rearview cause you never know who’s out to kill you
Lookout, lookout, lookout, lookout, lookout yeah
I don't need the hype
They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times
They lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and have you laying between the sheets with the eyes leased (Isleys)
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno, re-wind me back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack, y'all don't obey
Y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, modern day Issac Hayes
Theme song to Shaft, equivalent to the theme song to your career
Study my craft, you ignorant, I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay, and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucking with the music biz
The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the bidding war popping like an auction
5 or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door
Money in front of me, couldn't open the door
I'm so far ahead of my time, I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
I'm hardly a friend with y'all, i hate rappers, where is your artist at?
If it ain't a good picture you're draw, don't bring it to the architect
Often you arguing 'bout who got next, claiming you're running the game
Niggas are barely walking yet, hopping all over beats without studying training camp
Try studying a few greats then maybe you'll be where i'm at
Your songwriting ain't great, your mixtapes mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, you're not switching the flow
Your flow in the same place, just don't rap; elaborate
Try to expand, try to be more creative perhaps
My rap friends, i ain't saying you're wack, psyche
Like an in-voice, I'm just stating the facts, right?
(?) metaphores i write, in fact, it's been a factor
You've feared your whole life, no TV show
Don't compare me with them, that's like a shark versus Nemo, a gorilla to a chimp, Jordan versus Kukoč
A Tony Montana with blow on his nose to a Nino
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out tonight
I'd like to share with you, my celebrity scenarios
I promise I won't tell baby girl
I can hold water, I promise
I got this girl named Meagan Good
Well, you could say that Meagan was bad
The way she talk dirty he done threw me the ass
Like a quarterback Mr. McNabb
She introduce me to her friend Teairra Mari
Well, see Mari put a nigga to sleep
She made her boy feel good even curled my feet
Now please don't go back to Jay-Z
It's a rap, I used to fuck with Christina a while back
Which one, Aguilera or Milian, both of em
They did this little trick with their tongue
I came faster than a NASCAR spinning backwards
Brandi like to suck it she said she needed some practice
In the back of my bucket wasn't using no mattress
Brooke Valentine like to take it from behind
Face down, ass up, shit I love it when she climb
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin'
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, I won't tell nobody else
I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know
Psych
And about Vivica
I had her way before 50 Cent start dissing her
One thing I know, shit I hope he wasn't kissing her
Man she could blow like a torch
And dick without using a fork
She introduced me to Gabrielle of course
Union, had her on my backyard porch
Legs up film rolling, action, cut
She looking at me like "what happened, get up"
Shit I felt that I lucked up
Gave her my last name, Trina moved on
She fucking with Lil Wayne now
It's OK, I ain't crying about my hand-me-downs
I'ma sit back, take it for what it's worth
But for now I'm free, "can you please lift up your skirt?"
We can do lunch, later on be dessert
I'll give you a job, since 106 didn't work
Out
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin'
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, I won't tell nobody else
I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know
Psych
Ciara gave a nigga the goodies love tonight
And Bow Wow wants to see my cars out the house
He seen the burner on the draw and walked right out
Will Smith knows exactly what I'm talkin' bout
I had the same altercations when dealing with Jada
Baby momma drama I start fucking Fantasia
Nothing serious, she thought of it as a favour
And Lindsay Lohan, made my shit stand up
Like a Voltron, I couldn't keep my pants up
The Pussycat Dolls want the fantasy of all
Like, I'ma need some help trying to fuck all of y'all
Hour later, that's when Amerie called
Saying "this just one thing"
OK ma, "you don't have to fiend for the ding-a-ling"
I'll be over there, make sure Eve over there
I wanna see y'all mingling together
Remember that time at my house
Remember that time at your house
Remember that time on the bed
Remember that time on the couch
Remember that time on the chair
Remember when Nelly was downstairs
We all had a good time
Didn't we all have fun
As celebrities can we?
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin'
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, I won't tell nobody else
I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know
Psych
I told 'em that the truth was comin' niggas
Hey Punch, cover me I'm goin' in
I used to be sceptical about this rap shit
Now I'm a professional at this rap shit
Cause one verse can make the paralysed backflip
Don't compare guys to me, if Jesus could rap
They'd compare God to me, I'm special like that
I move like a freight train over these tracks
Run through you like wet doodle, that's what I'm doin'
Shittin' on niggas, perform bowel movements
Who you, you ain't up to par keeler
Nah keeler, you're word patterings is kinda off keeler
You ain't sick enough, you just a cough keeler
I bring pneumonia to California
Say hello to Mr. West now
Who's the best on the west now?
K.Dot, Jay Rock hands down
Anybody that feel different
You die first class on a cemetery visit, keeler
Keep it runnin' Punch
I told niggas the truth is comin' man
Hey Top put a couple houses on your boy man
I got your shit right here
I'm so far ahead of my time
I'm 'bout to start my third life
Shit I feel like I've died already twice
Then reincarnated and become your unborn grandchild's favourite
I got three brains to play with
I'm so far ahead of my time
I gotta say this shit again
But this time I came back
Double time, rebirth as a twin
Feet first I'm a mother smooth
Like deja vu, times two, now
You could probably dodge a bullet
But see we put your body parts in shopping carts
Till them bums push it
You on the edge nigga don't push it
'Fore the fifth turn you head crooked
I sit your monkey ass down
And best believe, it won't be on no damn cushion
A casket full of thorn bushes
Move the shit while the fiends look
Call the cops, shush
You fight the case better off the street
Daddy glove boxin, left hook the judge
Cap the jury up
You walkin' out with a Jefferson strapped
Like, if I come back, so what
It's a fact I rap like every second I gotta throw up
Ouch, spit shit like dookie mouth
Pull out the drop, six whenever your bitch out
We put her on the ave, like cabs and bus route
We put you on the couch, ice cream with your face pout
Watchin' Oprah, wonderin' if she ever come back over
Nah homie she at the crib, makin' her feet touch her shoulders
I'm in her ribs like, hey what's up
She in my closet talkin' bout how much these cost
Don't worry 'bout it, just make sure you tell your girls about it
You know Kelly, Kim, Sherry and Shirley 'bout it
Mama, you can see you fucking with a boss
Look at my kicks, you could see how much these cost
Look at my teeth, yeah ma, gold no floss, yeah
We still doin' it baby
Top Dawg we keep doin' it baby
I'm a boss nigga
This shit is fuckin' fond of me, Punch man
I tell motherfuckers the truth is comin' man
It's so fuckin' real man
Oh man
It's like a routine
When I step on the scene
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in
To society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached, I’m on some other shit
Like fuck the government, I’m higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing but my luck is bent
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation’s insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life’s a bitch when you ain’t focused nigga
Chorus
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy
When Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible"
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Tell me you love me
Know that it's real
I can see more
See how you feel
Look at my eyes
Do you realise
What is the truth
Your surprise
I despise, whatever's right
You're the wrong
This is my life
This is of you
This is of me
This is the truth
This is of we
This is for love
This here is God
This here is yours
This here is ours
Look at my eyes
Tell me you want me

I know you love me
I know the truth
I know the real
I'm speaking in you
I'm speaking in us
I'm speaking in we
I'm speaking in God
I'm speaking in free
You know who we be
You know that it's life
I know when you're wrong
I know when you're right
Just look in my eyes
I know your surprised
You tell me the truth
I know you despise
Ho!
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me it's real
I know the truth
I know you feel
Look at my eyes
Do you despise?
What have I said?
You're surprised
My lies
We hide in lies
What is free?
What is God?
This is the truth
This is the earth
This is for you
This is for her
This is for me
This is for we
This is for us
You can see
You're surprised
I realize
What is the truth
So help me God
I know that it's real
Know you fulfill
What I do love
What I do feel
Looking at you
Looking at we
This is more
Than jewelry
This is your life
This is my life
Look at me once
Look at me twice
Say it again
Born to win
Living in God
Hoping it's the end
I....Ho! Ho! Ho!
What it do homie?, it's your young boy god given
Your unnecessary spending show how you're living
Them diamonds in your grill won't you take 'em out
'Fore I pistol whip your jaw and spank 'em out your mouth
I'll show 'em what a real hijack's about
Take everything scrape the change from under the couch
Platinum to rose gold, it's gettin' sold
Whatever's left the dentist figure it out
Put the hog to 'em or trick em out
Watch me barge through 'em like rottweilers and pitbulls
We ain't ate yet, and you lookin' fools
17 shots in the clip got the chamber full
Bang, yeah, you're looking kinda right
Now it's time to say goodnight, so glad that you came
Bang, one more just because you made my trigger finger sore
Now, give me diamond rings

No começo, eu te amei
Mas agora eu só quero foder
Tarde da noite pensando em você
Até eu perder o tesão
Socado e pisoteado, lição aprendida
Você foi minha primeira namorada
Pontes queimadas por todo lado
Destruídas, mas pra quê?
Quando eu conseguir um contrato, mano, vou agir como um idiota
Vou pras pistas de dança com luzes piscando no salão
Vou jogar a puta da sua secretária pros irmãos
Um diabo de olhos azuis com uma bunda enorme
Eu vou comprar um Caddy novinho
Porta-malas levantado, duas vezes, um carrão
Platina em tudo, platina no anel de casamento
Casei com o jogo e uma vadia má que eu escolhi
Quando eu conseguir um contrato, mano, vou comprar um cano
Direto da CIA e colocar ele na cintura
Vou levar umas M-16 pra quebrada
Distribuir elas pelo bloco -- qual é a boa?
Vou por a festa de quintal de Compton perto da Casa Branca
Republicanos fogem, enxotados
Vou chegar no salão oval com ouro cubano no pescoço
Analfabeto, mas eu tenho um milhão no bolso, simples assim
No começo, eu te amei
Mas agora eu só quero foder
Tarde da noite pensando em você
Até eu perder o tesão
Socado e pisoteado, lição aprendida
Você foi minha primeira namorada
Pontes queimadas por todo lado
Destruídas, mas pra quê?
O que você quer? Um carro, uma casa?
Quarenta acres e uma mula, um piano, uma guitarra?
Qualquer coisa, saca só, meu nome é tio Sam, sou seu parça
Filho da puta, você pode morar no shopping
Eu conheço sua gente (Por isso sou gentil)
Não tem recibos? (Ah cara, tá tranquilo)
Pague depois e vista o couro
Clichê? Então diga "Fodam-se os outros"
Eu vejo o magnata em você, eu vejo o ouro e prata em você
Mentirinhas brancas, mas não há colarinho branco em você
Mas tanto faz porque eu vou continuar te seguindo
Porque você me dá vida eterna, baby
Conte tudo certinho, baby
Depois feche o caixa e me faça feliz, baby
Seu horóscopo é Gêmeos, são dois lados
Então é melhor contar tudo duplicado
Dois carros, duas correntes, duas notas de cem
Muito não é suficiente, nós dois sabemos
É Natal, diga a eles o que está na sua cartinha
Pegue tudo, você merece, Kendrick
E quando você chegar na Casa Branca, show de bola
Mas lembre-se que você reprovou em economia na escola
E tudo que você comprar, os impostos vão negar
E eu vou te acertar em cheio antes dos vinte e cinco chegar
O cobrador de impostos está vindo
O cobrador de impostos está vindo
O cobrador de impostos está vindo
O cobrador de impostos está vindo
And bummy, let her run me cause she bout it
Monday through Sunday we don't play no games here
You know how we get down, you know all the hoes love me
Money makes the world go round
So I'ma kick in the door
With the Mac 10, or the lone 44
Screaming give me the dough back nigga
Please, don't ask no questions
This a robbery nigga
You already know
Yo pockets kinda thin, shawty wanna go out on a date
Shit I got no chips to spend, but I said it's OK
Cause momma was drivin' the Benz
Her Jimmy Choos had me convinced
I said she was pretty, she love a nigga compliments
I had the thing with me, she didn't know
By the end of the day, she be breakin' off them arguments
I said fuck the ass and titties
I want the jewels and Benjies
I swear a nigga pockets was empty, starving
I whispered to myself, a nigga bout to come up
She like "Oh I beg your pardon"
Oh nothing, I was thinking bout your valet parking
I don't wife usually, but today I'll be your man
So we went to the restaurant, I said OK
I think about the getaway shit, over lunch
Like what type of jewels I want, everything
I ain't goin' back to the block 'till her body is clean
Snatch it off her cuticles, takin' off the pinky ring
I know this shit good but it bad as it seems
So hate conversation, little does she know
That nigga like you and me was patiently waiting, give it up
I wanted heartbeat, now thanks for the business
Go home, oh yeah please call me
Oh, I'ma tell your momma on you
The way make it move like a stripper do
Oh, I'ma tell your daddy on you
How easy it is to get next to you
Meanwhile, I'ma let you get wild in here
Meanwhile, I'ma let you get it hot in here
Meanwhile, I'ma let you do your thing in here
Meanwhile, I can keep a little secret, can you?
It's K-D-izzle
T-U-nizzle
How I get down, make moves upon the ground
Stand on the block with the K not the pistol
Fuck with Jay Rock everyday it's official
Seen shorty run away, not invisible
Fuck your mental a nigga love your physical
It's that simple I'll show you what a pimp can do
Put you on corners and have niggas renting you
Like real estate, see a bitch, fuck her face
K.Dot never hate, only dig, penetrate
What you know about that thing cupping your waist
Legs in the air duct tape
Know where the pope went?
I'ma send him to that same place
If you was smart you would touch base, like home run
Then grab pipe when the plumber come
Fuck casual, looking smooth in my whitey
Back in the days, yeah them girls they like me
I rolled with Doom Dog, now they all on my cock B
All wanna watch me
All wanna jock me
Take 'em and send 'em straight to bed
When they stop me
Have 'em with sheets over their head, like a Nazi
Wax on, wax off, Mr Miyagi
Let me know momma, I show you where your thighs be
Stick in all the time just like an IV
Your so called thick shit, that don't surprise me
Fuck, watch how I kill 'em with the funky rhythm
I'll bomb if you don't feel 'em, piranhas in 'em
Feed my persona as I get deep as Nostradamus
I'm ballin', cut up your pajamas if you're sleepin' on me
No promise, no peekin', homie
You're tryin' to confiscate the flow, I know
So I switch it quicker than my bitches
If they want your attention
One thing for sure, they gon' get it
I'm cursed with the world's negatives
Probably thinkin' I'm hurt, but that's the only way I can live
War, money, cash, drugs, got me feelin' like AIDS
Walkin' inside the club
.38 snub huggin' my waist like it had arms
Then I bear it, so I guess it really does
No paperwork on this marriage
Drunk off Paul, nigga, pourin' by the Rover, bitches
Pourin' hollows over haters, we killin' insecure niggas
Feelin' like the old Jigga, old Nas, old Big, new 'Pac
Oh my God, he's alive, he dropped bombs on you intellects
Bombin' everythin' from the streets to the Internet
Hear the instrumental wet
Then I'm a bust a nut, yep, I'm a fuckin' nut
That is not an Escalade, that's a damn armored truck
Shoot who? Shot what?
You ain't popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump
Who you motherfuckers want?
Leave a motherfucker slumped from the fuckin' pump
He's a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in a trunk
Might be out in Houston, lean in my pimp cup
Ride in '84s, throwed like a shot put
Hoes on my jock like I'm from the ATL
In our new block, choppers on the rooftop
Flip a nigga like he was a NBA mascot
Strip a nigga from his Wade cap to his two socks
Got it from them Compton blocks
Raised from my grandpa's
Every day, caught a fade like we like we own the barber shop
Goons in the parkin' lot
Who are you to fool if you bark a lot with no bite like an iguana
Get killed right in front of your momma
Hold tight, coroner comin'
Summertime, perfect time for dove huntin'
And you a woman want to be at my house with her ass out
She climaxed and passed out
And promotional flyers, K-Dot be the flyest
Eat ten rappers a day, that's a hell of a diet
Straight up like a kangaroo
Pumpin' like a fist do from a pro-black
This is automatic rap, made a minute, take a second
I'm a get it maybe here for a minute when I'm finished
Let's begin it
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
How I pay-pay lawyers, and nobody can't stand me
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
I got blood on my hands and it look like candy
How I pay-pay lawyers, and nobody can't stand me
Yeah-yeah (Turn me up)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Blood on my hands and it look like candy

Yeah-yeah

Voy a morir por esta mierda
He llorado por esta mierda, podría tomar una vida por esta mierda
Ponga la Biblia abajo y haz el ojo por ojo para esta mierda
PUNTO. Mi enemigo, no atrapará ninguna vibra para esta mierda, ayy
Me pisotearon delante de mi mamá
Mi Papá comisario lo hizo a comas
Perr*, todas mis abuelas muertas
Así que no hay nadie rezando por mí, estoy en tu cabeza, ayy
30 millones más tarde, conocer a los federales mirando
Tía en mi telegrama como, "Ten cuidado"
Estaré en casa de Tam, estaré en Stockton
No lo hago por el 'Gram, lo hago por Compton
Voy a morir por esta mierda, negro
Voy a tomar tu p*ta vida por esta mierdo, negro
No nos vamos a ir a la quiebra, familia vendiendo droga
Es por eso que usted culo negro lo sepa
Si tengo que dar una bofetada a un culo negro, voy a hacer que se vea sexy
Si tengo que ir duro contra una perr*, voy a hacer que se vea sexy
Me levanto, salto hacia fuera, el aire hacia fuera, voy a hacer que se vea sexy
No me sacarán de mi elemento
Nah, sacarme de mi elemento
Soy alérgico a una perra negra, ayy
Un negro rico imaginario, ayy
Siete figuras sostienen eso delgado más que la figura de mi perra, ayy
Voy digital y físico en todos ustedes, ayy
Un montón de criminales y dinero en mis llamadas telefónicas, ayy
Estamos bien, dejamos la A1 volar
Reubicar, saltar en el mismo G5
Checando para mí pesado porque yo voy sí, me voy sí
Ellos nunca estuvieron listos sí, yo sé sí, lo sé sí
100K propagación por todo el piso, por todo el piso
Ninguno de ustedes logrando ese flujo sí, ese flujo sí
Años en la fabricación, no todos lo confunden
Los tengo por un derrumbe, estamos hablando de carreras
Usted sabe que esto nunca será una corbata, apenas mira los cordones
Sabes que las carreras despegan, solo tienes que ser paciente
Señor uno a cinco, esa es la única lógica
Falsificar mi muerte, ir a Cuba, esa es la única opción
Si tengo que dar una bofetada a un culo negro, voy a hacer que se vea sexy
Si tengo que ir duro contra una perr*, voy a hacer que se vea sexy
Me levanto, salto hacia fuera, el aire hacia fuera, voy a hacer que se vea sexy
No me sacarán de mi elemento
Nah, sacarme de mi elemento
Maldito si lo hago, si no lo hago
Maldita sean todos si no lo hacen
Maldita sea, maldita sea, es una maldita vergüenza
No estás en primera línea, sal de la maldita manera
Negro como pensabas que no iba a verme, ¿eh?
Negro como pensabas que la vida real de K-Dot era la misma vida que ven en la
Televisión, ¿eh?
Negro quiere ganar por mí y estar en Los Ángeles de forma gratuita, ¿eh?
La próxima vez que lleguen a la autopista 10, necesitamos recibo, ¿eh?
Porque la mayoría de ustedes no son reales
La mayoría de ustedes gritaron
La mayoría de ustedes sólo son envidia, los celos te matan
La mayoría de ustedes lanzan piedras y tratan de ocultar su mano
Simplemente di su nombre y te prometo que verás a Candyman
Porque todo está en tus ojos
La mayoría de ustedes dicen mentiras
La mayoría de ustedes no se desvanecen
La mayoría de ustedes han sido advertidos
En mi Último LP traté de levantar a los artistas negros
Pero es una diferencia entre los artistas negros y los artistas sin talento
Si tengo que dar una bofetada a un culo negro, voy a hacer que se vea sexy
Es el único y el mejor de todo el mundo, el Kid Capri
Si tengo que ir duro contra una perra, voy a hacer que se vea sexy
Me levanto, salto hacia fuera, el aire hacia fuera, voy a hacer que se vea sexy
No me sacarán de mi elemento
Nah, sacarme de mi elemento
Oakland and 2Pac
Thinkin' they hot cause they homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lyin' to you, they tellin' a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record twenty-four hours, these niggas better get they bars up
I bench press this rap stuff
Got it locked like handcuffs, I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my AC
My jewels is on and I wish one of y'all'd try ride me
I shoot and have you land between the sheets with the Isleys
The helicopter's comin', realize there's nothin' behind us
Behind me, Your Honor
I fuck over these beats with no condom
This ain't rap, it's really a porno, rewind it back
Y'all ain't nice, nigga, y'all just okay
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, modern-day Isaac Hayes
Study my craft, you ignorant
I do it without a pen and a pad, just inspiration
Somethin' y'all never had
If my pockets is somethin' you tryin' to grab
See, I pulled out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, old dudes, get out my way
Let the young boy come through, don't mention my age
Shit, I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowd in my space
Look, you're not in my atmosphere
You can act like you're here
But actually you ain't accurate fuckin' with this music biz
The industry like, 'Fuck it, let the music be his'
No theme park, I'm not tryin' to amuse you kids
Small shark, Jaws is here, jump in the water
Do we really fuck with President Carter?
My reply's that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the biddin' war poppin' like a auction
Five or ten labels like, 'What he hatin' for?'
Except the zeros and more
Remember havin' Aftermath sittin' on my door
Money in front of me, I couldn't open the door
I'm so far ahead of my time
I got people five years from now pressin' rewind
I'm hardly impressed with y'all
I hate rappers, where the true artists at?
If it ain't a good picture you draw, don't bring it to the architect
Often y'all arguin' about who got next
Claimin' y'all runnin' the game, niggas is barely walkin' yet
Hoppin' all over beats without going through trainin' camp
Try studyin' a few greats, then maybe you'll be where I'm at
Your songwritin' ain't great, your mixtapes' medioc'
You recycle the same quotes, you're not switchin' your flow
Your flow in the same place
Try to be more creative, perhaps
My rap friends, I ain't sayin' that you wack, psych
Like a invoice, I'm just statin' the facts, right?
You'd have to count the metaphors I write
In fact, you've been a factor you've feared your whole life
No TV show, don't compare me with them
That's like Jaws versus Nemo, a gorilla to a chimp
A Jordan versus Kukoč
A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino
I want to press my like, yeah, I wanna press my
I want a green light, I wanna be like
I wanna press my line, yeah
I wanna take that ride, yeah
I'm gonna press my line
I want a green light, I wanna be like, I wanna press my—
Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm relivin' moments, peeling more residual
(I can) buy the building, burn the building
Take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more
(I can) justify my love for you
And touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal (ayy)
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard
The diamonds yours, the coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (brr)
I don't think they heard you why don't you tell them what your name is
I said my name is Kendrick, Lamar
Nigga my name is Kendrick, Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick, Lamar
I can tell you what it is
I can tell you what it isn't
No more K. Dot
My mother had named me Kendrick
Fuck a stage name
That's the name that I was given
The only thing that I can identify with in this business
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
Weighing my options pick up a bible or strap
I never kill'd a man
Never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
Put Smokey on my back
Y'all don't want me to win
I'm tryna find some dreams y'all want me to follow trends
If I die tomorrow my city would come with me now
I swear the sky will fall
Sold them wholesale to a snitch
They caught him on camera, promised him a sweet deal if he flipped
Plus they got him with the hammers, gun powder residue
That’s what I seen out my project window
Let it run, Q
(Smart ghetto ass)
If I die tomorrow my city would come with me now
I swear the sky will fall
If I die tomorrow my city would come with me now
I swear the sky will fall
So you can tell ‘em come get me now
When are we getting old?
Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I’m a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC Oh my God you gotta see
There’s never no I's in me
Of an Odyssey, I’m a block away
Fire marshal's moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I’m so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don’t care where ya are
Just blink twice and I’m there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killas, pimps
You ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It’s gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
I’mma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
Cause I’m going out with a fist raised
And a fist full of money give it to a fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don’t wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free J’s put us in PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
God-Damn, y'all cold
Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go
Although I’m in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
Get it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I’m being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
With your BM in it and your stash box glove
And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
I’m at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your careers over, he’s slumped over
And if I'm off beat know I’m un-sober
That's a new flow
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I’m a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
I’m a factor and your facial
I will fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math
Pastor’s like Eddie long, fucking maricon
Took me mighty long to get here
Nigga, Fuck!

But that red flag, blue flag, gang bang, murder state
Elementary kids liable they catch a case
So don't be surprised if a ten year old put one in your face
Kick in your door then put it to your face
Shake you up a little bit then ask you where the safe
Streets ain't safe and so I got the toolie on me
Movin' like a Mario brother, pardon me brother
But you gon' have to come out that whip, your mama might love ya but
I'm lovin' what's on your wrist, I'm lovin' what's on your neck
I'm lovin' what's in your head rest
You might as well give it to me or or be in peace with the rest deceased
Dippin' in lanes, duckin', dodgin' police
After we get away we celebrate over chronic tree
Who did you think rollin' with me?
K-Dot, Compton, visit my streets
I know about killa California
Badmon no fear fi haunt ya
But we no care about not a thing at all
No if it kill, we buss ya boy
Bo bo buss a shot for your area

So a burner ain't nothin'
Shoot him in his back for cold frontin'
Let him hold somethin', he with the Devil down south
Tell his ass to walk it out
Burner in his mouth, blindfolded on the couch
Give me the loot, give me the loot 'fore I shoot
Rip a tooth and your tonsils too
Exit out your neck bone, man, your shit gone
Niggas always gettin' me understood
Better ask your hood, they know what's good
Warnin' shot, Q, bitch
I could stand in a pool of gasoline lightin' a blunt
And never catch on fire
How come? You silly motherfucker, I'm fire
Smack the Devil over the cheek
Gave him a third-degree burn
Iced it down the same week and told him, 'You'll be okay'
A lot of rappers are desperate to be a star by the day
They hydroplanin'
They hopin' that they catch they big break
What are you sayin'?
I feel I'm the one like a magician
With a stick inside his hand of a name of a messy cane
I gets ignorant with you
Snap your picture, bitch, I'm famous
I came in this world with nuts in my palm
And drinkin' Paul Masson
In a stolen Cavalier like I took LeBron
Locked him in a basement and amputated his shootin' arm
Now that's a stretch, Ab-Soul
Like the fifty-mile strip when I'm pimpin' these hoes
Call me Dolemite, no, I take that back
And if any of y'all want a piece of the God
On 12/25 we send grief to your squad
The only problem I got now is label offers on the table
Like a table cloth is but I'm cautious
I'm like what Jaws is to crawfish
The big shot, that's why I talk my shit
That's why they on my dick
Like them little tricks that I taught your bitch
She'd probably lick it if I unzipped these Dickies
You need to quit it, knock it off
I'm in your girl ear like a cotton swab
And anythin' I say, I'm a blame it on that alcohol
Like T-Pain on a song with Jamie Foxx
I'm here cause it's my time, you came to watch
Every day it's ceramics class, pass the pot
Pues estaba dando una vuelta el otro día
Y vi a una mujer, una mujer ciega
Paseando por la acera
Se veía un poco frustrada
Como si se le hubiese caído algo y
Lo estuviese pasando mal buscándolo
Así que después de ver su problema por un momento
Decido ir a echarle una mano, sabes
"Hola, señora, ¿le puedo ayudarla en algo?
Me pareció ver que había perdido algo
Y me gustaría ayudarle a encontrarlo."
Me contestó: "Oh, sí, has perdido algo
Has perdido... tu vida."
Hello, hit every lying clip with a Eggo
I pop more than I pop for when the cop blow
You Fruity Pebble, homosexual wearing velcro
Who gassed you up? Man, I raised the price of the petro
Killing Cali, gang bangers and GTA's
Weed and water, come and swim on a tidal wave
I'm fucked up, psychologically braindead
I once walked into a Blood group, wearing all red
Wonder why nobody's banging on me
Getting mad as fuck, then the police came
Mistaking me for a real thug, this is not a game
I'm from Compton too, shoutout to Game, give me a pair of shoes
Finna skydive off the peak of my career
Though it's not here yet, you motherfuckers still know who's best
From the murder cap, you never heard of that, okay
What about now? Clip-clip, pow, man down
It's like this and like that and like this and a
It's like that and like this and like that and a
Killer Cali niggas don't know how to act and I

Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Compton, bang, bang, Inglewood, bang, bang
Washed up, bang, bang, you know what's good, bang, bang
Who said Long Beach don't keep it hood?
Five minutes away, say you can die today if you dumbing out
Well let's just say, if you run your trout
You fucking fish get shot in the mouth
And plus your bitch get shot in the mouth
That's ejaculation, you kiss it, then you taste it
I road around with my antennas up like
Television way before the satellite
K Dot mechanisms, learn something
I could tell that you don't know nothing
By the way you carry yourself
You dumb fuck, I'm basked up and Jim Carrey myself
You better duck, bless screwed, you'll be eating through a tube
I've been fueled, that's the fucking guy
I've been fueled, that's too fucking fly
So where's my parachute, I'm 'bout to jump from the Hoover Dam
No car cue, I think I landed in the Hoover, damn
They 'bout to shoot
It's like this and like that and like this and a
It's like that and like this and like that and a
Killer Cali niggas don't know how to act and I

Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, bang

Washed up, bang, bang, you know what's good, bang, bang
Just wave ya hands like this

Nobody come after
Nobody compete, y'all weak
This is more than us, an athlete
This is rhymes on stage, this is a rage
This not a party, this is a parade
I pass it to my homeboy Chance
Give it to em with ya homeboy man
I be rappin' off the top, I know I'm a star
How I end at Bonnaroo, we ain't goin' too far
I got a Super Jam to bond with me, it feel like Chicago
This the place you wanna end up, Bonnaroo make some noise!
Hey! Hey!
(Make music, hey!)
(Save music, hey!)
'Fore I pass the rock when I rock with Surf
I'm feelin' like I could use a shirt
But if I got a couple words I could use a verb
Livin' in a big pen, it's big Chance
With my big pants, we rock Pimp A Butterfly
Feelin' like a samurai off the top of the tippy
I'm feelin' like I'm a hippy, I used to be super trippy
I be hangin' with my homie, that's how music go!
And that's the music flow
And if you with me right now, homie now ya know
I said we talkin' bout Surf, talkin' bout K Dot
Knowin' we rule the Earth, talkin' about hip-hop
Talkin' this non-stop, talkin' that real rock
Talkin' right from Chicago, L.A. the top
Make some mothafuckin' noise in this bitch
Cause you know I don't stop, this is great as it get!
(Laughs) What are you doing?
Watchin' the sun.
Yeah? Why are you watching the sun?
I’ve always wondered why people say we shouldn't stare at this powerful source of energy. Made me curious.
What if you go blind?
I've never heard of anyone goin’ blind from starin' at the Sun.
Guess you got a point there. Have you seen anything yet?
Many things.
Like what?
See for yourself. You should turn off the phone.
Welcome to the present.
Too many opinions in the glasshouse
This world full of ego, let me cash out
I wonder what he's thinking about up there. Or if he's even thinkin' at all.
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic can't stand me
Ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
I got lood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic can't stand me
Ya-yah, turn me up, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
Ya-yah, ya-yah
This what kings do, vacay lands in Egypt
This what kings do, rake down plans with speeches
This what kings do, make sure mama is right, yup
This what kings do, hit Dubai in a night
And this how kings move, yo, hoe your money and invest wise
Whether you selling buttons or select pies
A king move, keep it silent, no one else dies
We all pharaohs in Camaros flexin' S5's (Uhuh)
It's what kings do, this how a king move (What up, son?)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, ayo
Blood on my hands and it look like candy

Ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah

Uh-oh, runnin' out of breath, but I

Esse pau não é grátis!
Tu olha pra mim como se eu não fosse um recibo
Como se eu nunca tivesse dado um jeito
E comesse seus restos e carne crua
Esse pau não é grátis!
Viver em cativeiro aumentou meu salário
Me dizendo que verde é tudo que eu preciso
Sendo que tudo que eu vi foi carne de lata e sardinha
Esse pau não é grátis, tipo, amor
Você realmente achou que a gente teria um filho chamado Mercedes
Sem uma Mercedes Benz e um aro 24 polegadas
Tinta 5% e saída de ar condicionado?
Mas nem fodendo! Esse pau não é grátis!
Eu preciso de quarenta acres e uma mula
Não de quarenta gramas e um pitbull
Besteira, abatedouro, abatedouro
Alguém bateu na porta, deixe entrar, quem é?
O melhor amigo da genitália -- esse pau não é grátis
Sinta pena do tolo que fez a beleza em você prosperar
Tetas grandes e lábios de buceta me mantiveram detestável
Me mantiveram vendo pornô na pobreza; desculpas? Não
Assisto você politizar com pessoas menos sortudas, como eu
Todo cão tem seu dia, agora ficar de quatro deve ajudar
Esse pau não é grátis!
Aliás, ele precisa de interesse
Aliás, ele tem 18 centímetros
Aliás, nossa amizade é apenas negócios
Pensão e mais pensão, você está beliscando meu dinheiro
Tem sido implacável, foda-se perdão, fodam-se seus sentimentos
Fodam-se suas fontes, toda distorção, se você foder, é mais abortos
Mais tribunais de divórcio e separação
Meu cheque com menos endosso me deixou dormente
Empoeirado, condenado, enojado, forçado
Que merda ainda tá faltando?
A pressão estoura os canos de porcelana duas vezes
A escolha está devastada, decapitado está o cavaleiro
Ó América, sua puta má, eu catei algodão e te deixei rica
E agora meu pau não é grátis!
Vou fazer meu Tio Sam calar tua boca
Tu não é rei nenhum
I'm back at the bridge
You niggas is sipping on 40's, I'm topping the keg
You know how we play
Two in their ass and one in their head
And bitch I ain't stopping 'till I get this bread
I know that you heard me but do as I said
I'm back at the bridge
You niggas is sipping on 40's, I'm topping the keg
You know how we play
K.Dot get dough
K.Dot get paid
K.Dot get hoes
K.Dot is not afraid
Whenever them vultures, start flocking 'round my way
Got my back against the wall, uh, I'm ready to spray
Standing by the lightpost, breakfast
Got my hand on my hand on my right toes
Cause shit gets, hotter than Hell's Kitchen
When fingers itching, it's more scratching
The DJs practice mixing
It's not baseball, but we stay pitching
Somebody come up missing, I swear it never fail y'all
Them feds got the line tapped, so we make collect calls
Local payphone, Superman, no cape on
We love blowing up shit, my style is like napalm
What nigga?, who nigga?, begin to fuck with the kid
And we'll shoot, at you niggas, what type of shit you got in?
Yeah, it's just a simple assignment
To make to make you niggas lose conscience
He like a fireman
Refrigerator filled with no food, only a lot of gin
So much weed smoke in the place, can't breathe in oxygen
Job didn't work, back in the hood selling rocks again
It's gutta, I'll rob a nigga for birds
Leave his coupe on fire
Leave his brains on the side of the curb
In the hood, yeah I'm blowing that herb
My phones tapped, Rock making business over the chirp
Yeah the block stay hot, like a furnace
Put a shell to their back, like a hermit
This is just a warning dog
They don't want it with them boys from Watts, California
Hundred Thousand units sold independantly we call it Ghetto Gold
I'm allergic to suckas achoo like I got a cold
And I don't hang around bustas like you, you's a hoe
You's a cub, I'm lion!
Why y'all always be trynna throw rocks at a giant?
Let me rewind it and define it
Pay hommage to KRS-One, Criminal Minded
I'm almost finished with this jug
Talking loud in the hotel lobby
My brain's hella clouded, BITCH!
Uh, see it's all copasthetic
All the time they be like ''Nigga, where you headed?''
"To the bank, my nigga, I'm trynna get lettuce"
Do it quick, fast everything be energetik
Energetik, lightning speed
Couple bottles of juice is all I need
And it's all copasthetic
Do it quick fast everything be energetik
Energetik, old nigga on the paper chase
Do it my way, fuck what you niggas say
No mimic, no gimmick, causin' pandemic
Epidemic: I invented what your man winnin'
Spitting venom watch me kill him when the venom hit him
Five Block, so you know I brought the Fifties with me
Aggravated for the paper I be showing out
Uh, see it's all copasthetic
All the time they be like ''Nigga, where you headed?''
"To the bank, my nigga, I'm trynna get lettuce"
Do it quick, fast everything be energetik
Energetik, lightning speed
Couple bottles of juice is all I need
And it's all copasthetic
Do it quick fast everything be energetik
Uh, back on the block with it
Back when I had worn my cousin’s shoes with holes and socks in it
Eatin' top rhymin', walk to school with a prepaid cellular
Crackheads tried to sell me a stolen Sox fitted
I tend to look at my upbringing a lot different
From where I’m at I inform you like Armonax that I’m two levels of terrific
Ya dumb bitch
We in yo hood with the transmissons, ya dumb bitch. Yee!
See this is Compton at its best, your four-o
And I’m loco as an esé with a fo-loco
And I stay local, I’m from the soil
Come from the bottom like the earth’s oil
Meet your SIHI at the coffee table
All that tough talking just telling me you poyo
I’m a rare breed, high off life without a gram of weed
Kendrick Lamar, a block off palma leaves
Sip the same palmasa my uncle put me on
This is me!
Uh, see it's all copasthetic
All the time they be like ''Nigga, where you headed?''
"To the bank, my nigga, I'm trynna get lettuce"
Do it quick, fast everything be energetik
Energetik, lightning speed
Couple bottles of juice is all I need
And it's all copasthetic
Do it quick fast everything be energetik
Tengo, tengo, tengo, tengo—
Lealtad, tengo realeza dentro de mi ADN
Un cuarto de cocaína, tengo guerra y paz dentro de mi ADN
Tengo poder, veneno, dolor y alegría en mi ADN
Tengo empuje, ambición, flow dentro de mi ADN
Nací así, desde siempre he sido así, inmaculada concepción
Transformo así, actúo así, era el arma nueva de Yeshua
No contemplo, yo medito, luego fuera de tu jodida cabeza
Esto que puso-los-niños-en-la-cama
Esto que yo tengo, tengo, tengo, tengo—
Realismo, yo solo mato mierda porque está en mi ADN
Tengo millones, tengo riquezas creciendo en mi ADN
Me puse oscuro, obtuve el mal, que se pudre en mi ADN
Me escapé, tuve problemas del corazón dentro de mi ADN
Simplemente vuelvo a ganar, luego vuelvo a ganar como en Wimbledon, yo sirvo
Sí, ése es él otra vez, el sonido del motor es como el de un pájaro
Ves fuegos artificiales y la rueda del Corvette haciendo skrrt en el boulevard
Sé como trabajas, sé exactamente quién eres
Mira, tú eres una, tú eres una, tú eres una—
Perra, tus hormonas probablemente se intercambian en tu ADN
El problema es, toda esa mierda dentro de tu ADN
Tu papi probablemente delató, herencia dentro de tu ADN
La columna vertebral no existe, nacido fuera de una medusa, calculo
Mira, mi linaje definitivamente no tolera la falsedad
La mierda por la que he pasado probablemente te ofenda, este es el hijo mayor de Paula
Conozco asesinato, condena, celulares desechables, contrabandistas, ladrones, mafiosos, muertos, redención, estudiosos, padres muertos con hijos y yo desearía ser dado el perdón
Sí, sí, sí, sí, ADN de soldado (ADN de soldado)
Nacido dentro de la bestia, mi experiencia comprobada en el segundo grado
Cuando tenía 9, en la celda, motel, no teníamos ningún lugar donde quedarnos
A los 29, lo he hecho tan bien, pegar la rueda del carro en mi propiedad
Y voy a brillar como se supone, antisocial extrovertido
Y la excelencia significa trabajo extra
Y la distracción qué carajo oíste
Y los pesimistas nunca me han puesto nervioso
Y eso es un riff, va a alegar su caso
La razón de que mi poder está aquí en la Tierra
Saludar la verdad, cuando el profeta dice
Tengo lealtad, tengo realeza dentro de mi ADN
Es por esto que digo que el hip hop ha hecho más daño a los jóvenes afroamericanos que el racismo en los últimos años
Tengo lealtad, tengo realeza dentro de mi ADN
Vivo una mejor vida, estoy tirando varios dados, que se joda tu vida
Tengo lealtad, tengo realeza dentro de mi ADN
Vivo una me-, que se joda tu vida
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Esta es mi herencia, todo lo que estoy heredando
Dinero y poder, el hacedor de matrimonios
Díganme algo
Ustedes hijos de puta no pueden decirme nada
Prefiero morir antes que escucharlos
Mi ADN no está para ser imitado
Tu ADN es una abominación
Así es como es cuando estas en la Matrix
Esquivando balas, cosechando lo que siembras
Y apilando el metraje, viviendo sobre la marcha
Y durmiendo en una villa
Bebiendo de un Grammy y caminando en el edificio
Diamante en el techo, mármol en el piso
Playa dentro de la ventana, mirando por la ventana
Bebé en la piscina, ambiciones de padrino
Sólo el Señor sabe que he estado dándole duro
Evadiendo paparazzis, enloqueciendo a través de las cámaras
Comer en Four Daughters, Brock usa sandalias
Yoga en un lunes, estirándose a Nirvana
Viendo todas las serpientes, rechazando a todos los falsos
El teléfono nunca encendido, yo no converso
Yo no comprometo, sólo penetro
Sexo, dinero, asesinato—estos son los cortes
Estos son los tiempos, nivel número 9
Mira arriba al cielo, 10 está en camino
Sentencia en camino, matanzas en camino
Hijo de puta, tengo ganadores en camino
Tú no eres una mierda sin un arma en tu cinturón
Tú no eres una mierda sin un boleto en tu plato
Tú no eres lo suficientemente bueno para hacerlo solo
Tú no eres lo suficientemente rico como para golpear el lote y patinar
Dime cuándo la destrucción va a ser mi destino
Va a ser tu destino, va a ser nuestra fe
Paz al mundo, déjalo rotar
Sexo, dinero, asesinato—nuestro ADN
ADN, ADN
Negro real en mi ADN
No hay ninguna puta en mi ADN
Chorreando oro en mi ADN
El poder se muestra en mi ADN
ADN
Negro real en mi ADN
No hay ninguna puta en mi ADN
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix
Yeah, yeah. So, y'all all curious. That's fine. That's fine, man. I'm – look, I'm a tell ya how ya boy, Moochie, landed his ass in this goddamn slammer. It was Kendrick. Yeah, Kendrick Lamar.
Yeah, right. This motherfucker.
That's right. Shit was wild, goddamnit.
This motherfucker.
We had a ball. Ay, nigga, you ain't gotta believe me, nigga. Goddamnit.
He's just talkin' about it.
Man, you ain't been in here that long. Your perm still new. So, anyways. You know what I'm sayin'? We had some strippers. They let us do everything we wanted to do, touch anything we wanted to touch. I was puttin' my finger in places, but my nail 'bout to fall off.
Kill these motherfuckers. You hear me?
I hear you.
Get that money and come out.
Man, you should a heard what this li'l' nigga was talkin', man. Talkin' so much shit on the block. Man, I been tryin' to tell ya. He talkin' 'bout he gon' get more money than me, he gon' get more money than you. I said, "Fuck this motherfucker, man. This li'l' motherfucker 'bout to get hit right now. Fuck him. Fuck this motherfucker right now."
Man, Malcolm, shut the fuck up. We gon' go in here, get the money, get out. Simple as that.
But you ain't hear what he said.
Nigga, I'm a smoke yo' ass. Now you fi'n' a get smoked, talkin' shit. What, bitch? What? What? Let's go. Let's go. Come on. You're talkin' that shit. Where is this motherfucker? Nigga, fuck outta here.

People can get murdered. Yeah. Here we go. Yeah. Yeah. What? What? What? What? Pull him up. Uh. We 'bout to murder this shit. Murder this. Murder that. Yeah. Murder that and this. Ha, we killin' this bitch. We killin' this bitch. We killin' it. Get the fuck up. Get your standin' on, niggas. It's a stand-on, motherfucker. Y'all ain't seen no shit like this.
I got these cops runnin' up on me 'cause I hit the back of the goddamn cop car. It wasn't my fault. I'm all ready to kick it with K-Dot and them tenders, man, and these cops sweatin' me about hittin' the ass of the car, goddamnit. I told them I hit the ass. I don't give a fuck if it's a fly.
Bu parçayı yerden 30 bin feet yüksekte yazdım
Hostes sert saçım üzerinden bana iltifatta bulunuyor
Eğer onu bütün bu yolcular karşısında becerebilseydim
Beni muhtemelen bir terörist sanarlardı
Kuşkonmazımı yiyin, sonra hostese genç bir zencinin düşüncelerini soruyorum
Hızlı gelen para ve özgürlük
Bir dolar için kaza kuklalığı, biliyorum onunla tanışmak için can atıyorsun

Bu sürtüğe geri döndüm, sürtüğün arkasında, arkam duvara dayalıyken ve senin kaltağın sikimin sınırlarında, kalk üstünden
Bir sürtüğe sürtük, bir kaltağa kaltak ve bir bayana bayan derim
Asfaltın üzerindeyken yeri kırmak dışında bir şey yapmadım
Lastik izleri sana bir şimşek hızı ile satış yaptığımın kanıtlarını verir
Bir çocuk olarak iki yetişkin öldürdüm, ben çok gelişmişim
20 li yaşlarımı 2 yaşımdayken yaşadım, akıllı adam
Gerçeği söylemek gerekirse 87 yaşında gibiyim
80 din adamı kadar kötüyüm
Alev dolu bir havuzda şeytanın elini tutuyorum
Bir mesafeden bakınca hangisinin Hristiyan olduğunu ayırt edemiyorum, kahretsin
2012'de kime güvenebilirim ki?
Kimseye, kendime bile güvenemem
İkizler yardım çığlığı atıyor

Oyunu ileri sarmamı istiyorlar

Elected to execute every rapper than has excelled
If music you callin', then you ball it, pick up your cell
If a nigga said he could see me, bet he told you in Braille
Fucker, put you on front street and buy some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, you shoulda worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldn't bear my triumph
I'm a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Swing your swords like I'm sparring with a Spartan
Make they face drop when the beat drop, I drop a rare jewel like a Martin
Fool man courage, balling like PeeWee Kirkland
Call him a Kirk Franklin, stomp 'em and leave 'em hurting
No judgement for the plaintiffs, they tried to find me guilty
Of as spitting as filthy as ODB, but I've been OD
Since '03 that's march 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it like Wheat Thin musical Chuck Norris

Who the hottest out? I'm a give 'em a heat stroke
Summertime, wearin' a peacoat
I be the baddest to ever put a lyric on top of an apparatus
Now trip, that's our flip, I'm a savage
Fabulous wordplay
And you can get served every day without a in-house maid
Be very afraid, I'm nasty with it
Born out the ass of a dragon, flamin', shitted on the masses
This harassment came from Kendrick, givin' out caskets
Puttin' these rappers in it, you fit the image of a dead man
Hennessy and chronic in the same night, so what?
Eyes red like a twelve o'clock fight
Yeah we gone keep it moving man
Your man DJ Skee holdin' it down
With my man Jay Rock
Next fuckin' superstar of the West Coast
Remember where you heard it first
You can tune in to him, on my radio show
You know we always playin' his shit
Saturday nights, Channel 40
Hip-Hop nation, satellite radio, let's go
Swerving through enemy lines might bust me a cap
Then I pull the car over throw the strap in the trash
Make sure the coast's clear, no signs of the crash
Only the strong survive, when I speak it it's real
Dawg it's real on this field, get killed for the skrill
Got ice on your hand, get killed for your chill
Killer Cali you bastard, keep you a steel
Pull out the Aston Martin
If you talking too much pull out my coffin
Pull out another one for his brother
Real comfortable, even get his favourite colour
I burn rubber off the V12
I fuck international females
My last bitch bitch was speaking some German shit
Catch me vacating on the Germany trip
Eyes red, sandals on like, fuck what Cam'ron said
I'm pecking for the bread
But nothing like a pigeon
I'm something like a vulture
You wanna know how I do it mothafucka I'll coach ya
They call me Phil Jackson
I train your day like Denzel, welcome to practice
Yes I'm the baddest, if my lyrics had looks
This rhyme right here belong in the beauty pageant
J. Brown asked me do I got it, been had it
This beat is pornographic
I fuck off it
I'm jumping out, dumping, let him kill me in a stand off
At least back behind the car I fire back with the K
That's what it is, fire back where you stay
I spent my whole life trying to climb back with the yay
Man, how long you been, how long you been rappin' for?
Uh, I been doin' this professionally, uh, four or five years. Professionally, uh, recording as a career; not on the block freestylin'...
My day one motherfucking fans in this building, one time. As I look around-this the shit. I ain't been this intimate in a long time. We might be up here all motherfucking night, I got something. I ain't seen y'all in a minute, real shit. You know I mean it when I say, I been around the world and shit. A whole sea of people. But nothing like coming right here in front of this small group. The people that's been with me since day one. Kendrick Lamar EP. Kendrick Lamar OD. Section-mothefucking-.80. Real shit. This is cool right here goddamn, this is really cool right now. This about real shit, listen up. To Pimp a Butterfly. People said a lot about this album. That'd said album of the year, that' said album of this generation and all that shit. That's cool, but also real shit making this motherfucking album was therapy. Not only for you, but for me, You know what I'm saying? Because within six months of good kid, m.A.A.d city dropping, the life of what I knew, when I knew what it was, thinking I knew, that completely changed within six months. And uh, you going through the motional of the world telling you that you're great. And you trying to make yourself believe that shit, but it's hard because you're institutionalized from where you come from. Still trying to move around and stay the way I like I do. I'm a low-key nigga. And I ain't scared of the world. Me personally, I can't run around with a hundred niggas like I usually do. I don't need to, I don't want to. And that's just been me since day one. So trying to grasp the idea of them telling you who you should run with, it can't cut it. Because like I said on the Kendrick Lamar EP, "I need to be me goddamnit". I think this shit can live forever, but looking at y'all faces y'all just. I got some of the most loyal. dedicated motherfucking fans in the world (?). (?) I could talk all day (?). To Pimp a Butterfly. Y'all allowed this motherfucking album has soared all the way to the top with no motherfucking commercial success. Y'all allowed it to be top-tier without a constant radio single and shit. So that proves to you right there, music is not something you can motherfucking market all the time. This shit belong to you and you only, you know what I'm saying? Some shit that y’all can feel whether you insecure, whether you vulnerable, whether you mad, happy, angry, sad. You pop this motherfucking tape in, you pop your favorite music in, and you love and you live that shit. And you allow artists like me myself to come back to these group of people and perform the shit that I want to perform, you dig what I'm saying? This may be the first and last time I perform To Pimp a Butterfly on this run. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York be one of them cities that I come back to to do this shit. So with that being said, we gon' rock this shit until the casket drop or until, until it all falls down. Let's go
Killa
Killa
Killa, killa

Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough
Uh, now tell me who it is
K-Dot, young kid runnin' the music biz
You tell me what's worse
Me bein' the best rapper or rappers dyin' of thirst?
I'm just like a gun-clapper with these words
And you know I'm packin'
And that word is meant for Janet Jackson
I'm a black hippy, that's what I know
I wear a heart black, I love peace, that's my clothes
And so, and I don't know this name
(Steve Buscemi, he's the actor, man)
Thank you for that ad-lib, G
Next thing you know, I google him up, it might be me
I hope he's rich, I hope he's contra
Band in my pocket, no, I don't have sponsors
Don't want the police to come in this place
Because I might run and I run this race
That's in the rap game
You got some more words, I go absurd
I got nouns, I got more verbs, this is the curb
I swing, my nigs, I flip flows
I come from the West, I do it the best
I don't stress, no contest
Any rapper want to come see with Rickey Smiley?
You can't see me, we creep up back of the alley
And beat they ass and take they cash
And then we stab, off in that Jag
I'm in, uh, celebrity crushes
I give 'em, they see me, I give them blushes
I'm talkin' Halle Berry, Stacey Dash
But she vote for Mitt Romney
No, I don't want that ass
I'm talkin' Obama, I'm talkin' more drama
This another word, your momma
Nah, that's Ebony Steele, that's me, for real
She got them long hairs, but she don't wear high heels
That means she's confident, that means she's beautiful
That mean she got no dirt in the cuticles
That means she got that watch
I mean, she got the shades
Shirley Caesar, left seat, man
After forty years, they'll sweep her in through the city
That's like me, that's like Jay Z, Pac and Biggie
That like me, that's like rappers don't know where I'm from
That's Compton, everybody don't want none
I got the people in the back straight cheerin'
I got the eyes wide open just like the deers in front of the
You have yo' shit be pre-prepared or ya' know what's your process? What's your songwriting process? You here to be- do you break out a pen and pad and go at it hard or how you do it then?
I- I hear the beat first, people. I hear the beat first and then I just go wherever the beat is tellin' me... just like all of the- ya' know all the other greats say
What, no pen and no pad?
Maybe
I mean but that seems kinda'.. you know like-
Yeah no pen, no pad then. (No pen no pad.)
Aight yeah! but I mean aye I just- that's what I see. I mean but is that- does- does that- is that like the breaking point to- to really break you away from other artists that- you know that puts all the artists that don't use pen and a pads a different realm?
Naw, it just- it just a- a challenge, you know? You know Jay and Big ya' know were doin' it way back you know what I'm sayin'? It's just you know- I dunno, it's almost starting to become a cliché now, you know what I'm sayin'- I might fuckin back hop on the pen. Naw but uh (laughs) But yeah- but naw. You know. It's all- it's all- it's- it don't matter in- at the end of the day you know, whatever makes-
Oakland and 2Pac, I'm more focused
I'm nothin' like these rap gods fumblin' over a few lines
Thinkin' they're high 'cuz their homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lyin' to you
You tellin' a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hours, these niggas better get their bars up
I bench press this rap stuff
Got it locked like handcuffs, I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my AC
If you talk that better have enough balls to walk that shit
Cause we don’t give a fuck about who you running’ with
We will flame yo shit and all you gonna hear is (what happen) yeah (what happen)

Like, sike, nah I’m bluffin’ that boy was somebody else
So we hurt that boy, hurt that boy
They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
But a loud mouth get a entrée of bullets right to the head, shit
Bon appetite, I climb out my window I shoot ya block up then I’m back in the bed, sleep
Back to the business, backpack with blocks all in it
When it comes to beef I’m doing the dishes, shit
More beef then I’m stuck in the kitchen
To stop my trigger finger from itchin’ I’ll probably need a prescription
Plus, I told you niggas too many times, you're not in my division divide mathematician
Counting money like it grow on trees
Matter of fact it do, I got a lawn full of hundred dollar bills, no leaves
My bitch got a blade in her weave just incase mine break she hand one to me
Cataracts I know y’all can’t see I infact I apologize about that
If you talk that better have enough balls to walk that shit
Cause we don’t give a fuck about who you running’ with
We will flame yo shit and all you gonna hear is (what happen) yeah (what happen)

We was OG like D.O.C., remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now
Y'all know, y'all know DJ Dave. Y'all know how it go, on the interviews and shit. I-I know we wil'in', but your boy's under the weather right now. But we gon' keep pushin'. Now-now-now the "Top Dawg" in your tee, like that...

Everybody think they can rap, and everybody starting they record labels and everybody pushin' out they songs And if that's what y'all wanna do, go hard. But what separates our company from their company?
Consistency, man. You know, just, you know, perfect your craft, man. Try to block out all that other shit, man, just worry about your craft. Business, and the business will fall in place

You know I got the sure shot

Gotta be us and gotta be due
Step up, emcee
If you want time right now
Come right now
And shine! (x6)
Hold up!
I gotta leave y'all with at least a few bars
It's not about the women, the money, stars, and cars
It's not about the clothes, the hoes
Know who we are
It's all about the mentality
Love making chords
Your life makes you bruised and battered
But that don't matter
If you wanna know
Fuck all that chitter-chatter
Do your thing, let 'em sing
Let the gun-boy reign
Bite the sound, I just came and blazed
What's up!
Nalej (wypiłeś), Headshot (wypiłeś)
Siadaj (wypiłeś), wstawaj (wypiłeś)
Odjechałeś (wypiłeś), obudziłeś się (wypiłeś)
Najebany, (wypiłeś), najebany (wypiłeś)
Dorastałem
Wokół ludzi, ktorzy przeliczali życie na butelki
Dziadek miał złotą piersiówkę
Po niej pływał na plecach po Chicago
Niektórzy ludzie lubią to uczucie
Niektórzy chcą zapić smutki
Niektórzy chcą wpasować się w trendy
To był mój problem
Byłem w ciemnym pokoju
Głośna muzyka, wkrótce miałem
Złożyć przysięgę, że się napierdolę, więc napełniam szklankę
Widzę jak porusza się tłum
Wszystko zmienia się z minuty na minutę, ciągle ta sama piosenka
Jeden łyk, drugi łyk, a potem ktoś mówi:
Czarnuchu, masz zamiar przytulić tylko dwie czy trzy sety?
Pokażę ci, jak się trochę rozkręcić
Najpierw bierzesz basen pełen wódy, potem w nim nurkujesz
Basen pełen wódy, potem nurkujesz
Pomachałem kilkoma butelkami, wszyscy ustawili się w kolejce
Wszystkie dziewczyny chciały bawić sie w 'Słoneczny patrol'
Mam basen pełen wódy, a oni w nim nurkują
Basen pełen wódy, zanurkuję w nim
Nalej (wypiłeś), Headshot (wypiłeś)
Siadaj (wypiłeś), wstawaj (wypiłeś)
Odjechałeś (wypiłeś), obudziłeś się (wypiłeś)
Najebany, (wypiłeś), najebany (wypiłeś)
Ok, teraz otwórz swój umysł i posłuchaj mnie, Kendrick
Jestem twoją świadomością, jeśli mnie nie posłuchasz
Będziesz tylko wspomnieniem, Kendrick
Wiem, że ci teraz niedobrze
Ale ja mam nadzieję doprowadzić cię do zwycięstwa, Kendrick
Jeśli wypiję jeszcze jednego, to chyba zwali mnie z nóg
Czuję ten rytm
Widzę miłość w jej oczach
Rozumiem to uczucie
Wolność nadchodzi z butelką wódki
Czerpiesz z tego korzyść
To rodzicielska troska
A ja najwidoczniej jestem pod wpływem tego, co robią oni
Myślałem, że zajebiście się bawię
A wtedy ktoś mi powiedział:
Czarnuchu, masz zamiar przytulić tylko dwie czy trzy sety?
Pokażę ci, jak się trochę rozkręcić
Najpierw bierzesz basen pełen wódy, potem w nim nurkujesz
Basen pełen wódy, potem nurkujesz
Pomachałem kilkoma butelkami, wszyscy ustawili się w kolejce
Wszystkie dziewczyny chciały bawić sie w 'Słoneczny patrol'
Mam basen pełen wódy, a oni w nim nurkują
Basen pełen wódy, zanurkuję w nim
Nalej (wypiłeś), Headshot (wypiłeś)
Siadaj (wypiłeś), wstawaj (wypiłeś)
Odjechałeś (wypiłeś), obudziłeś się (wypiłeś)
Najebany, (wypiłeś), najebany (wypiłeś)
Najpierw ja, potem ty, bang!
Jedna broń, sto strzałów, bang!
Wyskakuj, bądź sobą, bang!
Jedna broń, dwieście strzałów, bang!
Czarnuchu, masz zamiar przytulić tylko dwie czy trzy sety?
Pokażę ci, jak się trochę rozkręcić
Najpierw bierzesz basen pełen wódy, potem w nim nurkujesz
Basen pełen wódy, potem nurkujesz
Pomachałem kilkoma butelkami, wszyscy ustawili się w kolejce
Wszystkie dziewczyny chciały bawić sie w 'Słoneczny patrol'
Mam basen pełen wódy, a oni w nim nurkują
Basen pełen wódy, zanurkuję w nim
Nalej (wypiłeś), Headshot (wypiłeś)
Siadaj (wypiłeś), wstawaj (wypiłeś)
Odjechałeś (wypiłeś), obudziłeś się (wypiłeś)
Na*ebany, (wypiłeś), na*ebany (wypiłeś)
I'm from the gutter, that's all that I know
Crack pot, dope spots, gun shots, I wonder, will you follow me home?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, south paws, we out here, and Pharrell here
Don't come 'round here, looking for John Doe
That's something that I know, Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm from the gutter, that's all that I know
Crack pot, dope spots, gun shots, I wonder, will you follow me home?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, when the sun falls, we out here, and Pharrell here
Don't come 'round here, looking for John Doe
That's something that I know, Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dreams of this paper, dreams of this paper
Ridin' 'round with my middle finger up in the scraper
Middle finger up to my motherfuckin' haters
I'm so serious, but I laugh at you later, aye
Your heart is cold and there’s no one to run to
I grab my gun, cause that’s how I know to protect you
Street justice, street justice, street justice, street justice
This is my life, and that’s how I’m gonna protect you
Street justice
This is dedicated, 25 summers I waited
Back when papa was sedated, uncles all incarcerated
25 cousins to play with
Also 2 grandmas I played with
One had died, one moved to Vegas
Both had died, I started raging
Back when LA get the laces
With the blue sprinkles and …
Only broke our concentration
We was broke but mama saved enough
To keep refrigeration stocked
With cut noodles and baken …
The black car was the first to watch
Black boy, first to drop
Then my homie, the first to shoot
Then his homie, the first to drop
So look homie, my best pursuit
Is music, this was finalized
When I seen the devil eyes in that Buick
I was hypnotized
War going on outside, nobody safe from
Kicking your door to ask you where you get your safe from
Kick you some more, you ask me where I get my hate from
Compton, baby, Afghanistan, this is phase one
Compton, … new talibans, central raise one
Rosecrans street tell them coppers get off me, day’s done
Got darker than Alfred mayweather
Never been so cold, 2 sweater and a long nose, they stressing
When the world is cold and there’s no one to run to
I grab my gun, cause that’s how I know to protect you
Street justice, street justice, street justice, street justice
This is my life, and that’s how I’m gonna protect you
Street justice
We all like Gingis khan, everyone think they can just become
The punishment of god, but problems never get solved
All the way from Compton’s corner out to Oakland shake it hard
I get a woody wearing hoody, before your eyes just…my marks
And bullets hiding lyrics from myself and Ken Lamar
In the middle of this war, we made it out to be star
Cop cars never came with good cops
I gotta keep it cop just for my neighborhood watch
Street justice
Your heart is cold and there’s no one to run to
I grab my gun, cause that’s how I know to protect you
Street justice, street justice, street justice, street justice
This is my life, and that’s how I’m gonna protect you
Street justice
Oh, okay, okay. I understand that. Okay, now, for uhh people who don't know, where'd you grow up at, man? Like, you know, what type of city. What area?
Uhh, Compton. Straight Compton. No sides. No - just - niggas used to roll down Rosecrans, we used to be bumpin' that - pops used to be bumpin' that NWA shit. And, uh, shit - you know, "cruise down that street in my 6-4." We wasn't in no 6-4 though. We was in the brown dukie van and shit, same color as dukie
(laughs)
Know what I'm talkin' bout? But uh, yeah, we'd bump that shit all day
Oh, okay. And what influenced you to become, you know, a rapper?
You know, the typical person would say, uh, "other rappers." I'mma be straight up honest, when I found out I was dope - Next question...
Bounce
Last night, you had the pink bike
Riding around, face bright, sunshine
I feel a bit tough, excitement
Care too much but don't feel like trying
What else should I be trying?
Should I tell her that I'm caring, rap about six flaws or maybe seven
Scary hiding from my problems
You not a problem but if you are we can solve it together
Write a few letters
Make a state together, don't change like the weather
Leave for good, or worse 'cause right now
Of course you're the store's favorite
Don't change at all just here me saying
Words that sound cheesy
Everyday at Mcy D's with a burger or cheesy fries to match
Supersize, any size, you a prize in my eyes
That's right
How about some fries and cartoons tonight?
As long as I'm with you, I'ma be alright
I ain't tryna sound horny but please just adore me
Write our own love story and tell it to my shawtie
Sounds right
I know it sounds right
Your love, my love, sky love, high love
Make a blade say high love
Let's go and touch the sky love
But I would- your boobs so tough
Trigger max, so rough
It's all good with me love
But I would
Your love, my love, sky love, high love
Make a blade say high love
Let's go and touch the sky love
But I would- your boobs so tough
Trigger max, so rough
It's all good with me love
But I would
But I would
But I would
But I would
But, but I would
How about some fries and cartoons tonight?
As long as I'm with you, I'll be alright
I ain't tryna sound corny, I'll be alright
But please just call me
How about some fries and cartoons tonight?
As long as I'm with you, I'ma be alright
I ain't tryna sound horny but please just adore me
Write our own love story and tell it to my shawtie
I would
I still remember the first time
That I ever turned my boombox on
I just lay back and unwind
Whenever I turn my boombox on
I still remember the first time
That I ever turned my boombox on
I just lay back and unwind
Whenever I turn my boombox on
Welcome to my world
Back when Martin was the shit
And rocking ...
... bottles of Saint Ides
...
K was like nah, a young buck
Tryna find his outlet, coulda been an outlaw
Lil Wayne wasn't out yet, inspried by DMX
Inspired my first rhyme, glad to find a .49
I hadn't struck a gold mine
Ya'll done fucked up
My lyrics like BUCK BUCK
Then reload, then BUCK BUCK
Until he get FUCKED UP
Porno, lights, cameras, action
I'm about to get it cracking like the ceiling in your grandma's attic
Bitch I'm at it all night long
Hong Kong ... King Kong
And that means I'm quick to stampede
On each and every song I be
Kendrick, expensive, lyrics out the ass
You smell what I'm kicking, boomboxes I get wicked
Pull up...
I still remember the first time
That I ever turned my boombox on
I just lay back and unwind
Whenever I turn my boombox on
When times is crazy
I look at the stereo and it say, "Play me!"
You see, this is my story my pain
My struggle and fight
And when I wanna get away from life
I put my boombox on
Ohh, I put my boombox on
Ohh, ohh oh
Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell 'em
They can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga fuck your feelings, this is me
Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell 'em
They can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga fuck your feelings, this is me
Recognize my life
Ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
Cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell 'em
They can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga fuck your feelings, this is me
Shout to my nigga Shellcase for doin' this beat for me too
That nigga look like a praying mantis
Drunk off a hard liquor, pourin' bottles over bitches
Pourin' halos over haters, killin' insecure niggas
Feelin' like the old Jigga, old Nas
Old BIG, new Pac, oh my God, he's alive, he raps
Bombs on your intellect
Bombin' everything from the streets to the internet
Get the instrumental wet
That is not an Escalade, that's a damn armor truck
Shoot who? Shot what?
You ain't popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump
Who you motherfuckers want?
Leave a motherfucker slump, from the fuckin' pump
He's a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in the trunk
Lean in my pimp cup
Hoes on my jock like I'm from the ATL
And I know black choppers on the rooftop
Flip a nigga like he was a NBA mascott
Got it from my grandpop, was raised on them Compton blocks
Every day caught the fade, like we on the barbershop
Goons in the parkin' lot
Ooh you's a fool if you bark a lot, with no bite
In front of your momma
Summertime, perfect for duck hunting
And your women wanna be in my house
With her ass out, she climax then pass out
Like promotional flyers, K Dot be the flyest
Eat ten rappers a day, now that's a hell of a diet
Your girlfriend she all on me
Say she wanna clean my dirty laundry
Say she wanna clean my dirty laundry
Bitch I'm K Dot and I'm keepin' it friendly
I got this, jumpin' like a kangaroo
From the pro black, this is automatic rap
Have a seat, grab a snack, we gon' be here for a second
Armageddon might be here, when I finish pray the Heaven has a home
I'm alone in my own galaxy
You'll never have a headstart with a dead battery
And they screamin' agony, when I write shit
My life is, filled with excitin'
Visions of a nigga making mills with a strikin'
Impact for ten years, I've been here before
See this is all premature
I start the war like an instigator
Chopper, they some cream gaters
On a thursday, mix the Vodka with the Sprite
Better yet, roll the dice, watch me come up
Look, yeah
Fuck the critics
They don't know I spit it for the dub on my fitted
I wear it like a pendant
Rock's city don-dada
Who hotta?
Nada
L.A. crews, Mufasa
Shoutout to old crews, represent the same casa
West coast product 2009
They still trippin' off the cest smoke
Show me a dime
Kill a pussy with my death stroke, every time
You best know, my style canal
I got the best flow
I stay with the pound, so I'm good from the ground up
Let me take ya soul, I ain't fuckin' around
Nah, blood, cuz, or whatever
That get the shut up
Like Cheeto puffs
Keep bad boy o's that we gon' puff
Jay Rock what?
Top Dawg run the game let 'em know
Back by popular demands
Give it to you fresh out the kitchen
Pots, pans, hope my parents riches
Spit it like I had denchers
Suicidal thoughts, got me feelin' like Sean Kingston
Hip-hop with precision
We talkin' global
Perform global warming, ha
All them drops, I dropped a hundred down today
Yo' mouth drop, top missin' like a dropped toupee
I'm goin' through tracks like Jerome Bett-is
So fast you get whiplash or head-ache
Bars like Alcatraz, never been felon
But I spit it well to all the men in county jails
Dwell, on the fact that yo' plummet record sales
Make you clumsy with the gat
Yo, I'm so far ahead of my time
Finna lap my damn self
I'm still in the hood, like a fan belt
The fan mail comin' in bulk, hop on a bull
Every time you wanna see it reminds me of the flow
See notes like a treble clef
Step to the best and see why these niggas fall short
Like I tripped the dwarf from torn from a different cloth
Warned by a different boss
The art soon will make y'all crumble
I'm humble, but still anybody could get it
Fuck y'all, this verse is sexually transmitted
Never timid, I'm winnin' like I got dibs on it
State of mind so large, we could all live on it
Start a new community...
I remain the winner, on my grizzy
Might even hibernate this winter
And I'm still on some boss shit
Like, I don't care how much it cost shit
Yeah, nigga, I'm a mack
So much pussy on the line, I don't know what the... snatch
Yeah, Ab-Soul light a match
Got the killa outside
Let's smoke ugh, K Dot, Compton city lyricist
Don't wack niggas, yeah I know they fearin' this
Me without a dollar is like a scholar with no smarts (whats that?)
That don't make sense don't it? (mm-mmh)
I'm in a Lamborghini with a Brazilian woman (oh yeah?)
Miss Novocaine
Suck my dick till she numb it (god damn)
You fly like a plane
But I'm more like a comet
Soaring over the atmosphere
I can hear the aliens cheer (ha)
Victory is sweet my dear (mm-hmm)
Here's the technique my dear (mm-hmm)
And maybe you can duplicate me
It's weird how y'all never can progress within the process
Of making residuals
I guess that you ain't I yet
Try to interfere with the dinero that I get
Watch y'all bear arms like women rub on my triceps duddy
Y'all is funny to me
You thought I came by myself nope
It's money with me
It's the root of all evil, but the need of all people
Yours is frail
I weigh mines on Brannon Scales
I need a get rich quick scheme
I need a get rich quick scheme
I'm trying to live the American Dream
But the odds are against me
I need a get rich quick scheme
I need a get rich quick scheme
I'm trying to live the American Dream
(Yeah I want it all)
But the odds are against me
(Trying to take over the world)
Empty envelopes deposited to the safe
Withdrawn as much as I could take
30 days late car no pass too
I'll park it somewhere else if it's what I gotta do
(And I got bills, bills, bills, bills, bills I can't afford)
1-800 numbers on my caller ID
Won't get a call 'til I hit the lottery
I'm tired of living pity broke
As I promise all the levies that was in in o (?)
I hit the bank to withdraw the tellers tell me in o'
I wanna have commas and live with common rich folk
You know the Oprahs and the Russells
With the hustle that can put me number six on the Forbes list
Rick James screaming out, "I'm rich bitch"
But for now I'm just an average Joe
Drinking Kool Aid, boiling water, noodles on the kitchen stove
Gotta use them jumper cables just so my car can't get cut off
Every morning this is boring, you was touring, I was doing
Wishing I was balling out
Zipper open showing groins
But for now I gotta rob ya
Kids is what make me feel so good
See you looking at the glory that's coming up into the future of life
See the younger youth is what's gonna make everything to keep going
After I done passed down the hill
Young and black!
Then there's a lot of funky things in this country
And there's a lot of good things too
But there's more funky than good
We've changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Dude, we got to get our minds together!
Anytime a brother was shot another brother in his own neighborhood
Then go to his funeral and turn over his own casket
They need to have the police down there
Cause see the niggas is N.A.A.C.P
Niggas ain't actin' like colored people
If I can't work and make it, I steal and take it
They come up to me with a nigga who can put air in a bottle and sell it
He can do it man
A nigga can sell anything
As I watch the sky change colors
The rain flooded the neighborhoods of the black brothers
The black mothers are stressing, the coroners have covered
Another statistic, episodes of a cold summer
The street runners got the same legs of Michael Johnson
The fast life surpassed life beyond the conscience
Profanity in the air, the children use the content
The vanity's in the air, that Louis bag: haunted
The black girl with the hair, that's kind of coarse
Her baby daddy's in court, she smoking on a Newport
Seventeen with dreams of becoming a stripper
Or becoming an AIDS victim while touching them zippers
The life that we living in, things we would do just to live again
How can an angel forever live in sin?
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
You know, anybody that uses somebody else to gain is pimpin'
Well, I tell you what soul brother, lookie here
Can't nobody pimp you but your pimp ass self
You understand?
Then there's a lot of funky things in this country
And there's a lot of good things too
But there's more funky than good
Shit ain't gettin' better
We've changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all
Yea, this shit got me feelin' kinda like Sunday evenin'
On the pulpit, me and my heathens
Me and Consequence circle your seven continents all in one weekend
Make sure your proposal is decent, get exposed to treason
The last of the dyin' Mohicans when mentionin' rappers
My niggas'll rat-tat-tat you, then kiss your mother right after
Disaster'll strike faster than a thief in the night
The thesis of a black man, policemen never could write
That's why our backs against the walls, gun raised
Takin' out everything, like bank withdrawals before the year 2K
And by the end of the day, I'll be America's most wanted
Shot and confronted while runnin' from the CIA
Livin' life as a rebel, the last Panther stuck in the ghetto
Tuckin' the metal like junkyards and rockstars
The smoke never settles, where I'm from
From a tree to the corner-stores is where we hung, uhh
...you youth listening side off, so hope
I  take chances, you throw tantrums
I  drop hits, you drop soap
And you plant it, I'm romantic
Advances,  get checked on...
This is King Kendrick Lamar
Kendrick Lamar, the best rapper
Especially if you never heard music before 2010
I be the new DMC
When I'm crying up on the beat
I'm not the king of New York
I'm lying straight through my teeth
I take a bit of the meat
And I put it between a bun
And I eat it it's really fun
I go on a burger run
I'm from Compton
But I'm supposed to say Bompton
I know someone in my hood
Like "Fxck Kendrick I'll stop em"
"Soon as I get around him"
I'm going 'round and 'round
I merry go 'til I vomit
I got ears like comic
So when I'm in a cartoon
Don't laugh like I'm retarded
I got ears like a fan
And they just wave like I farted
Try'na block out the smell
Of dead bodies and homi's
When you take your last breath
You turn your drawers to a potty
I killed Jay on a song
They acted like it didn't happen
Soon as I did "Control"
Now they wanna start rapping
All these niggas is hype
But I ain't impressing Phil Jackson
Got the Brian McKnight fade
Cause my hair started napping
Crips asked me my set
I turned around and I ran
Mama keep calling me
Cause she still need her van
I got sneakers like Vans
My Vans looking like sneakers
Broke the screen on my phone
Now I can't see when you tweet us
I'm in love with Aaliyah
So me and Drake gon' relate
When twin cousins named Fist and Hand
Go blam when they see ya'
Don't talk to my old lady
I feel like Usher and Kellz
You can have Sherane
I know that her pussy smells
Compton
Dreams
Keep dreaming
Cause I don't know
How to complete it
Sun
Keeps shining
And making a glisten
From the tears I'm crying
We have nothing to fear
But fear itself
We're not forced to love
But let's love ourself
Start here first
Then to the world
Life too short, enjoy yourself
Don't be scared to ask for help
Pave the way
To a light day
Find the right way
To your bright estate
There's so much I someday wanna do
So much I wanna try & prove
I'm honestly not one to go & brag
But there's really so much I have
To offer to ya'll
My creative ideas can fill a whole mall
But I'll make my prices cheap
But the ideas deep
Everything I make has a message
And I try not to teach ya'll a lesson
You do you
You stay true
I wish I learned that earlier
Good thing I was told by a little bird
Now I can sleep at night
And accept my non-normal life
Pave the way
To a light day
Find the right way
To your bright estate
Anxiety gets the best of me
Like North Korea could bomb us any week
And our final moments are us turning to debris
That's something I'm afraid to see
I wanna be in the generation like Kylie
And not fitting in with Abercrombie
I'm trying be free
And not drowned in a sea of people thirsty
For attention
What a weird dimension
That we all now living in
Was this the intention?
Might need an intervention
To see inside these walls
And see them having withdrawals
From one once was
Pave the way
To a light day
Find the right way
To your bright estate
I want to press my like, yeah, I wanna press my
I want a green light, I wanna be like
I wanna press my line, yeah
I wanna take that ride, yeah
I'm gonna press my line
I want a green light, I wanna be like, I wanna press my—
Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm relivin' moments, peeling more residual
(I can) buy the building, burn the building
Take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more
(I can) justify my love for you
And touch the sky for God to stop, debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal (Ayy)
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard
The diamonds yours, the coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (Brr)
With so much knock in the LBC
It was hard not to claim that DPG
Summertime popped in the L-A-C
With the music courtesy of D-A-Z
And the Soopa, Doopa, Fly for the troopers
Riders, supers, hoes, groupies
All of 'em with the short tight jeans on
"Let's Play House" all of 'em theme song
Word on the gangsta, squad up
Black, brown, throw a St. Ides up
Then the West got harder
And Soopafly hit 'em on the head on Tha Doggfather
Don't nobody party like the West though
G-Funk been the sound since Death Row
Where you think we got the kicked-in clap at?
Time to bring it back, bitch, and it's like that
I'm about that shit, hoe, gotta get this money
Long Beach, C-R-Son, all the shit is sunny
Put the monkey in it, like the shit is funny
Banana Clip Rassy 'bout to spit this dummy
But funkers told me to kick back
I like revenge, retaliation, and get back, nigga
Got more bars than Kit-Kat
Get smacked like Katt Stacks if you lip jack
A muh'fucker betta recognize
With a flick of my wrist like a Vulcan, you all die
All I do is ball high
Tryna stay above the rim like a tall guy
Dat Nigga Daz, Soopafly, alright
OG to BG, I thought I warn ya
Only in California
Moving down Rosecrans, bumping D-A-Z
Feeling like 1-9-9-3, only one to the 710
I'm in Long Beach, home of Dillinger
Dealing the gangsta shit, gangsta killa
You wankstas quit filling ya iPod up with classics
Ain't a nigga out could match them ad-libs
D-P-G-C General
Gin on my breath while Jennifer hold my genitals
Yeah it's like that cause I was taught that
Back when Dogg Food dropped in the Compton Swap Meet parking lot
Daddy V had three, sold one to my pops
We was popping out, the trunk in the Caddy was rocking out
Slap a nigga in the face with the 808s
Even made Pac salute, snares like a bear trap
They're unbearable too, bare witness
Hits like Barry Bonds, Daz the realest
Uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
Well, oh, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I see another mountain to climb
But I, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, I need another lover, be mine
'Cause I, I, I got stamina
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
Well, uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
But, oh, I got stamina
And oh yeah, running to the waves below
But I, I got stamina
And oh yeah, I'm running and I've just enough
And uh-oh, I got stamina
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up, I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive

The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
Oh oh, I got stamina

The greatest, the greatest alive (don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, no no no)
The greatest, the greatest alive (don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, no no no)
The greatest, the greatest alive (don't give up, don't give up, don't give up; I got stamina)
The greatest, the greatest alive (don't give up, don't give up, don't give up; I got stamina)
The greatest, the greatest alive (don't give up, don't give up, don't give up; I got stamina)
The greatest, the greatest alive (don't give up, don't give up, don't give up; I got stamina)
And you niggas is borderline bitches
That’s my opinion
And my niggas is ride or die Aftermath my religion
Talk out but I don’t listen
Act out and come up missing
That click clack pow did it
Like Colin Powell did it
And I’m so west coast, ok corral with it
My new foreign car can't pronounce that shit
You fuck around…count that shit
Broadcasting live from Compton California where foreigners never come Mothers are worrisome and we dislike the governor
I hope these angels can cover us
If the LAPD ain’t doing it then it was a cover up
Coroners about to cover up everybody
I’m serious, every shotty is saw'd off
And every nigga is militant
And your gut like...What?
EBT Cards, no credit can't ease cards
All my life beed OG aw now my life on the billboard soon
Give me room, I react like a wildebeest and
Throw salt inside your wound your just diabetes to me
Ain't shit sweet with these hotels homie
That crip shit got my uncle’s life in jail ho
So if I put the same line, they'll never forgive me
Or worse than that the niggas right around the corner might kill me
I’m fighting back when it’s hard what
No barber my guards up, the author of fallen fathers that did it without much, this my house nigga
O quê dinheiro tem a ver com isso
Se eu não sei a definição total de um ícone do rap?
Eu tô preso dentro do gueto e não tenho orgulho em admitir
Institucionalizado, eu continuo na correria pra fazer uma visita, pera aí
Traz de volta
Eu disse que tô preso dentro do gueto e não tenho orgulho em admitir
Institucionalizado, eu ainda posso matar um preto, e daí?
A vida pra mim, é tipo uma caixa de bombom
Quid pro quo, algo por algo, em claro e bom tom
Eita porra, esse flow é foda, mas não vacila
Roubar meu estilo vai infectar sua amígdala
Eu não sou capaz de aliviar a indústria política do rap
Ordenhando o jogo, nunca intolerante a lactose
O último lembrete de algo real, você sabe o óbvio
Eu, escolarizado? Não, as ruas foram minhas faculdades
Ser o que der pra ser, de fato, mas o problema de verdade
É que o sonho só e sonho se o trabalhor for diferente
Me faz pensar nos manos que costumavam me conhecer, mas escuta só
Vou te dizer minha hipótese, talvez eu seja leal demais
K Dizzle vai servir pra ti, meus manos pensam que eu sou um deus
Na verdade eles que são birrentos, mas você não costuma estar no mesmo saco
Mas algo em ti mudou desde que eu te levei pra porra da BET Awards
Você conta com o ovo antes da galinha
Tanto ouro ao seu redor e você quer ele todo
Alguém me disse que você tá pensando em roubar jóias
Eu devia ter escutado quando minha avó me disse
"Quê que eu vou fazer quando só o que eu vejo são esses ricaços?
Com o papo constante sobre o dinheirão, as mansões e as viagens pro estrangeiro
Os jatos particulares e passaportes, salões presidenciais
Garrafas de vidro, modelos douradas, dando o cu por
Uma marcação no Insta, chupando rolas, que porra é essa?
Se mais um merda desses der um tchauzinho
Meu mecanismo de defesa vai me fazer ir atrás dele
Com pressa porque ele tem sobrando
Estamos em recesso, então por quê diabos ele tá indo pro puteiro?
Chega de ser pobre, diz 'oi' pro meu 4mm
Quando eu ver eles, o dinheiro cai na conta
Tipo Kendrick, eu sei que eles são seus colegas de trabalho
Mas não vai demorar muito até essa cobra fumar
E eu posso ver o relógio dele pela TV e ficar de boa
Mas o meu relógio corre quando eu pouso nos States
Lembra, 'roubar dos ricos e dar aos pobres'?
Pois esse sou eu nesses eventos"
Acho que minha avó estava avisando um moleque
Quando ela disse...
I'm willing to die doing this shit
Might even take a life for this shit
By that I mean decode their lies for this shit
And watch you cry cause your shit
Freezer got gold rims
In debt, now go dim
This is what happens
When you too focused on balance
Dollars come in a bakers dozen
Like we getting bread
But I know focusing on that too much
Will get us dead
So try to understand my footprints
But at the same time, make your own blueprints
If you want it, go for it
But know it's not just money
You're worrying about how much wealth it is
So you can add to your wrist
I'm confused how mumbling can get you a car
In the future, it can only take you so far
I won't judge what you wanna do
But it's kinda talentless, it's the truth
Like Cole said, "Imma make sure the real gon' prevail."
And not the people that only worry about the sales
Those sales might not even get you a nice boat
But that cold hard cash could maybe get you a coat
You're washing yourself in this ego to cope
And you messed up like you just dropped the soap
Ever since I was born in 2003
My family trying to make ends meet
Living in brick houses like Rob Zombie
And now I still don't care about where I live this week
Dollars come in a bakers dozen
Like we getting bread
But I know focusing on that too much
Will get us dead
So try to understand my footprints
But at the same time, make your own blueprints
If you want it, go for it
But know it's not just money
...fuck up the vibe
Go through my phone, you make me lie
We only look better when we don't got to try
Girl you look better when you don't got to try
Real niggas still in style
Real women still in style
Fake hoes out of style
Каждое утро, когда я встаю, я знаю зачем мне дальше идти
Много всего старается сбить, но мне не свернуть с нужного пути
Много лживых друзей, много шлюх хотят часть меня оторвать
И каждый раз их ожидает провал
Сила ведь в правде – и это факт
И что бы ни случилось – похуй
Что бы ни случилось дальше
Что бы ни случилось, знаешь
Время идет, и мы стали старше
Москва не верит слезам, но Jack Daniels скучные будни разбавит
В конце обернешься, посмотришь на труд свой – гордость за то, что сделали сами
Большая скорость, громкая музыка – это точно про нас, да
Ногинск это точка «А» в точку «Б» - Соколиная гора, брат
Планы – вперед, к вершине мира, и бить по тормозам не резон
Большая жизнь, большие цели и первый заработанный миллион
СД
Родной город даст мне силы – себя чувствую как босс
Много километров впереди ,проедем – не вопрос
В Питере родных и близких много, как и в Новосибе
Но Москва со мной всегда. Москва – тебе спасибо
СД & Ekzzz
И что бы ни случилось – похуй
Что бы ни случилось дальше
Что бы ни случилось, знаешь
Время идет, и мы стали старше
Что бы ни случилось, пережить помогут нам всегда верные друзья и Москва
Люблю тебя, Москва
Я слишком часто ошибался в людях, потом больно из-за этого очень
И нет гарантий, что это в последний раз – подъебут еще, хочешь не хочешь
Но то, что дальше будет, точно стоит прогулки босиком по раскаленным углям
Зови меня Кларк Кент, я чуть выше этого. Быть Суперменом чертовски трудно
Я найду свою Лоис Лейн в толпе из Вавилонских блудниц
Моя жизнь – только подъем к вершине, и больше никто меня не тянет вниз
Были моменты когда уставал, опускал руки, но отдыхать больше нельзя
Сейчас я многим лучше, чем был. Осознать это мне помогли друзья
Для сотен MC, как кость в горле. На фоне меня они девочки, тупо
Я знаю, что каждый из них, даже тот, что респекты кидает, хочет, чтоб я был трупом
Но sorry, зай, до жопы дел. Пусть эти девочки плачут дальше
Москва поддержит, но если хочешь замеса со мной – оставь надежду
Уже не будет как прежде, каждый, кто будет против – будет повержен
Раньше я будто во сне жил, однажды проснулся - нашел в себе титановый стержень
Passo per Passo , verso del sogno – и только так, без вопросов
Как бы ни было сложно - nessun rimpianto, nessun rimorso

Psychotic loco mentally deranged in the brain
Y'all niggas don't know what I'm saying
My shit complex y'all shit just plain
Like a brown bag of m&ms y'all niggas is lame

Lames stay in ya lane
Cause the shit i spit is high oktane
Y'all can't obtain what i bring to the table
Nigga I'm the kane and y'all ain't able
Showkase High Oktane i got it
If money be the topic / strong arm robbery

Mhmmm...
Every line is a narcotic
Id be lying if i said i never distributed crack product
Color blind if it ain't about dough/ then i don't holla
I got cataracts if a dolla ain't where I'm at
Say hello to your honors
Prince hakeem in them latest paper denim jeans/ chains and pinky rings
Get custom made top dawg logo
Versace shades more bounce than pogo sticks
When i dip in the low low
People like he gotta be rich no

Nigga I'm the kane and y'all ain't able
Like the waters in the open sea
When tribulations come all we can say is hopefully
And yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me
But today I'm overly dedicated, I'm 'posed to be
A testimony for broken hearts in the city
You either crash landing or planning on flying with me
Misery loves standing behind its company, well
Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell
On our past encounters, reaching over the counter
Told me that it's a appealing to pop a pill, that's a downer
I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep
I heard when you see a dove, that's what you try be
Got these burdens under my wings, but I'm still free
Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray I'll look you in the eye and say
During the Revolt interview, Lamar was also talked about the important role that music plays in his life today.
It's just something I breathe now, I didn't always breathe it. I always was a fan of it, but now I really live it. That's inspiration within itself.
During the brief interview, Lamar was also asked about what his next steps are.
Really getting back in that studio, locking in. Just keep continue with music, continue challenging myself. I don't really got much goin' on outside of music. So, that's about it.

Two shot the diligence
I slide on my hater like skrrt (woah, woah, woah)
I’m killing this shit don’t get murked (woah, woah, woah)
Two shot the diligence
No more reminiscing on who shot, we finish it
Blade runner, walking on thin ice, admit it is
Hot feet running, I been nice, I’m it, legit
All of the studios
Cut off the lights
Persuasive invasion, that could cost our life
Head in the clouds but my vision alright
Looking though fog, yeah my head at the night
Audio cardio, I jog your brain
Just like I'm Kanye, they think I’m insane
Look up to God and he calling my name
How can I handle the faith and the fame
Minha vida toda eu tive que lutar, nego
Minha vida toda...
Nos tempos difíceis: "Jesus!"
Nas nóias: "Jesus!"
Nazaré, eu sou fodido
Mano, você é fodido
Mas se Deus é conosco, então a gente vai ficar bem
Pois é, e quando eu acordo
Eu reconheço que você me olha pensando em cortar despesas
Mas homicídio te olha com um olhar fixo
Que arma estoura se não for alto o bastante?
Esquematizando, e deixa eu te falar da minha vida
Entorpecentes me deixam numa nóia
Onde buceta e dinheiro são o foco
Diz pra minha mãe que eu amo ela mas é disso que eu gosto, Deus sabe
Vinte deles no meu Chevy, diz pra eles virem me pegar
Colhendo o que eu plantei pro meu carma chegar no Céu
Sem audiência preliminar no meu registro
Só pra constar, eu sou um marginal silencioso, tá
Digam ao mundo que eu sei que é tarde demais
Meninos e meninas, acho que endoidei
Me afogo nos vícios todo dia
Por favor, acreditem no que eu digo
Você não sabia?
A gente já sofreu antes
Nego, quando nosso orgulho cai
Olhando pro mundo tipo "Pra onde a gente vai?"
Nego, e a gente odeia os cana
Selado que querem matar a gente na lama
Nego, eu tô na porta do pastor
Meus joelhos enfraquecem e minha arma pode disparar
Mas a gente vai ficar bem
O que você quer? Um carro, uma casa?
Quarenta acres e uma mula, um piano, uma guitarra?
Qualquer coisa, olha, meu nome é Lúci, eu sou seu parça
Filho da puta, você pode morar no shopping
Eu posso ver o mal, eu vejo e sei que é ilegal
Eu não penso nisso, eu deposito o resto dos dígitos
Pensando no meu parça, traz o prêmio, põe no carro
Cavando no meu bolso, não há lucro grande o suficiente pra te alimentar
Todo dia minha lógica põe mais um dólar no teu bolso
Na presença do seu filho...Ah!
Eu não falo sobre isso, não discuto, todo dia eu avanço
Se eu consigo então você consegue, Paraíso, eu te alcanço
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, meu parça, é isso
Tranquilidade, e Chad, eu encho a bolsa por vocês
Eu rimo, sou negro, então fiquem tranquilos
Meus certos e errados, eu escrevo até estar quite com Deus
Você não sabia?
A gente já sofreu antes
Nego, quando nosso orgulho cai
Olhando pro mundo tipo "Pra onde a gente vai?"
Nego, e a gente odeia os cana
Selado que querem matar a gente na lama
Nego, eu tô na porta do pastor
Meus joelhos enfraquecem e minha arma pode disparar
Mas a gente vai ficar bem
Eu mantenho minha cabeça erguida
Eu me convenço e espero morrer
Me amar é complicado
Com medo de várias mudanças
Eu tô bem e você é um favorito
Noites negras nas minhas orações
Eu lembro que você estava conflituado
Usando sua influência da forma errada
Algumas vezes eu fiz o mesmo
Abusei do meu poder, cheio de rancor
Rancor que se tornou uma profunda depressão
Me encontrei gritando num quarto de hotel
Eu não quis me auto-destruir
Os males de Lúci estavam ao meu redor
Então eu corri atrás de perguntas
Te amar é complicado, te amar é complicado
Te amar é complicado, te amar é complicado
Te amar é complicado, te amar é complicado
Te amar é complicado, te amar é complicado
Te amar é complicado, te amar é complicado
Eu ainda te culpo, ainda te desonro
Acho que você é um merda, acho que você não sente
Confiança em si mesmo, chorando no chão frio
Vendo estranhos anônimos me dizendo que sou seu
Mas você não é ninguém, me convenci que sua tolerância não é especial
Pelo que posso te culpar? Mano, eu posso citar várias
Situações, vou começar com sua irmãzinha carregando
Um bebê na barriga, apenas uma adolescente, cadê sua paciência?
Onde estavam suas antenas?
Onde estava a tal influência que você dizia ter?
Você pregou em frente de cem mil mas nunca falou com ela
Vou te falar o teu erro, tu não é líder, caralho!
Eu nunca gostei de ti, pra sempre vou te desprezar, não preciso de ti!
Nem eu nem o mundo, não deixe ele te enganar
Números também mentem, foda-se teu orgulho também, ele é pela dedicação
Pensei que o dinheiro te mudaria, ele te tornou mais complacente
Eu te odeio pra caralho e espero que você aceite, eu juro que—
Te amar é complicado, te amar é complicado
Te amar é complicado, te amar é complicado
Te amar é complicado, te amar é complicado
Te amar é complicado, te amar é complicado
Te amar é complicado, te amar é complicado
Te amar, te amar, ou não te amar, 100 graus
Eu sinto sua vibe e reconheço que você sente vergonha de mim
Sim, eu te odeio também
Você é o motivo da mamãe e ele estarem partindo
Não, você não é ninguém, você diz que ama eles mas eu sei que tá mentindo
Eu sei que você é irresponsável, egoísta, vive em negação e não consegue evitar
Suas provações e tribulações são um fardo, todo mundo sabe
Todo mundo ouviu, vários tiros, ecoando pelas ruas
Você tinha desertado, onde mesmo estavam suas antenas?
Onde estava sua presença? Onde estava o apoio que você fingia?
Você não é irmão, você não é discípulo, você não é amigo
Um amigo nunca deixaria Compton por lucros, ou abandonaria seu melhor amigo e seu irmãozinho
Você prometeu cuidar dele antes dele ser atingido
Onde estavam suas antenas? Na estrada com bebida e vadias
Você fez UMA chamada de vídeo, isso é imperdoável
Você fez uma chamada de vídeo ao invés de uma visita no hospital
Talvez você tenha pensado que ele ia se recuperar
Na terceira cirurgia eles não conseguiram parar a hemorragia
E ele morreu, o próprio Deus disse "Caralho, você falhou", você nem tenta
*Chorando*
Eu conheço seus segredos, preto, mudanças de humor são constantes, preto
Eu sei que a depressão descança no seu coração por dois motivos, preto
Eu sei que você e uns caras de outros blocos não estão se falando, preto
Vocês tão tretando, eu vejo que você é o motivo, preto
E se essa garrafa falasse *gole*
Eu choro até dormir, seu merda, é tudo culpa sua
Sua culpa despedaça tudo, desmorona todo fim de semana
Porque você vazou na mesma hora que soube que confinamento era necessário
Eu sei seus segredos, não me faz contar eles pro mundo
Sobre aquelas coisas que você anda pensando e sobre aquela vez que *gole*, eu tô quase apagando
Eu sou fodido, mas não sou tão fodido quanto você
Você não consegue se ajeitar, eu acho que seu coração é à prova de balas
Eu devia ter te matado a muito tempo
Você devia ter sentido aquele tiro há muito tempo
E se esses espelhos falassem, eles diriam "Você precisa partir"
E se eu contasse seus segredos, o mundo saberia que dinheiro não consegue parar tendências suicidas
When should I start, my mind is apart
From playing videogames, , then back to the start
I am not even kidding when I say I stop washing my face
In the mornings, texting you back
It is crazy, how we get obssesed
With things that arent useful, then we feel stressed
We become a mess, we might need a distress
Signal, to tell others we need help
Help, yes we need it yet we dont accept it because we are inside this shell
Wake up, go to work, we on some kind of wicked system
Some kind of wicked list of things we do that
We dont accept its
Kind of what you see when people are on the streets
They talk to themselves
You ask to yourself, is that myself?
Talking to some higher being that relies on a shelf
I dont know. But i know that I do
I ask God every night, free me from this delights
He watches me, wanders his gaze and he looks at my face
And he says, silence
I dont listen to him, I think Im going crazy
If he doesnt talk to me, who is gonna save me
But then my conscience is chasing me
I go silently to my bed while some voice is telling me:
Why are you saying you need to free yourself
Why are you asking for help, do you not believe in yourself
You can make it through if you have enough will, man
But you have to swim out of this pool before you drown in it, man
Me despierto, siento, dolor y sufrimiento
Recuerdos de la noche, misma mañana en un desierto
La bebida, la salida, la vida, la esquina, la cima
La unica salida que veo para mi vida
Matutina es la nocturna
Y encima, cargo con pesadillas, mis noches son frivolas
Ir a "trabajar", encender la television
Dormir y pretender que mis sueños son mi familia
No tengo quien me arrope
La noche es oscura, mi mente se calla
Y el sonido de la calle, me llama
Suenan disparos, suenan las motos, gritos sollozando
Esto es mi mundo, encerrado en mi tumba
Moriré seguro, y mi voz no retumba
El silencio, la dueña de mi tortura
Lo poco que queda, para que sea la medianoche se turna
En lo poco que queda para que se vaya la luna
Odio la noche,la luna, y que la vida sea igual de inmadura
No entiendo, como mi ego me afecto en el camino que una
Vez transitaba, la vida pasada
La viste pasar no, no la dejaste pasar, verdad?
Eso me decían pero que le haría
Si igual algun día me rechazaría
Son metaforas con doble sentido que espero que algun dia no se cumplan
Pero seguro en la mente de alguno seran memorias que mas que pasadas son continuas
Esto es una piscina llena de mentiras que intentan alejarte de la verdad
Mientras mas te undes en ella, mas dificil se te hará flotar
Vou mandar uma ideia...
Não quero macacos filhos da puta que nem vocês
Sentando no meu trono de novo
"Ei ei, mano, qual a boa?"
"K-Dot voltou pra quebrada, mano!"
Tô bolado (Tá bolado!), mas tô de boa
Amigos de verdade, uma pergunta:
Carai, onde vocês tavam quando eu caminhei?
Fiz o mundo inteiro falar e agora virei rei
Rei Kunta, todo mundo quer cortar as pernas dele
Kunta, negro que não leva desaforo, pode crer
Carai, onde vocês tavam quando eu caminhei?
Fiz o mundo inteiro falar e agora virei rei
Rei Kunta, todo mundo quer cortar as pernas dele
Você tem esse cheirinho? (Que cheirinho?)
O cheirinho de liderança
Vocês conseguem sentir quando eu ando na rua
(Conseguimos sim, conseguimos sim)
Eu até curto rap, mas um rapper com escritor fantasma?
Que porra é essa? (Essa não!)
Eu jurei que não ia falar, mas maioria de vocês compartilham barras
Como se estivessem presos numa cela de prisão (Uma cela de prisão)
Tem coisa errada aí (Tem coisa errada aí)
E se eu tiver que beijar um pé por grana
Eu prefiro ser um mendigo e viver na lama (Pode crer!)
Carai, onde vocês tavam quando eu caminhei?
Fiz o mundo inteiro falar e agora virei rei
Rei Kunta, todo mundo quer cortar as pernas dele
Kunta, negro que não leva desaforo, pode crer
Carai, onde vocês tavam quando eu caminhei?
Fiz o mundo inteiro falar e agora virei rei
Rei Kunta, todo mundo quer cortar as pernas dele
Você tem esse cheirinho? (Que cheirinho?)
O cheirinho trazido pelo Richard Pryor
Manipulou Bill Clinton com desejos
Vinte quatro horas por dia, sete dias por semana vezes dois
Eu refletia quando saía do palco
"Vou voltar pra quebrada, ver os inimigos e gritar bem alto..." (Pode crer)
Carai, onde vocês tavam quando eu caminhei?
Fiz o mundo inteiro falar e agora virei rei
Rei Kunta, todo mundo quer cortar as pernas dele
Rei Kunta, negro que não leva desaforo, pode crer
Carai, onde vocês tavam quando eu caminhei?
Fiz o mundo inteiro falar e agora virei rei
Rei Kunta, todo mundo quer cortar as pernas dele
Seu cabra filho da puta...
Eu ia matar alguns rappers, mas eles fizeram isso por mim
Eles são suicidas, nem precisam pedir ajuda pra mim
Essa porra é elementar, eu provavelmente vou ser preso
Se eu matar sua identidade e sair ileso
Finquei uma bandeira na minha cidade, todo mundo gritando 'Compton!'
Pra ser sincero, eu devia me candidatar a prefeito quando isso acabar
E eu juro pela minha mãe e minha filhinha também
Vinte milhões vão sair do tribunal gritando 'amém!'
Pode pá, pau no cu do juiz
Eu passei dos vinte cinco e fiquei feliz
Um neguinho cabeçudo com o mundo detrás dele
A vida não é nada além de uma vagina gorda
Gritando, "Annie, você está bem? Annie, você está bem?"
Limusine pintada com placas de ouro
Direto do fundo, essa é a barriga da besta
De um camponês, para um príncipe, para a porra de um rei (Pode crer)
Carai, onde vocês tavam quando eu caminhei? *Tiros*
"Quando você ouvir o próximo tiro
A fumaça vai estar dentro de ti" *Tiro*
Fiz o mundo inteiro falar e agora virei rei
Rei Kunta, todo mundo quer cortar as pernas dele
Rei Kunta, negro que não leva desaforo, pode crer
Carai, onde vocês tavam quando eu caminhei?
Fiz o mundo inteiro falar e agora virei rei
Rei Kunta, todo mundo quer cortar as pernas dele
Fumaça, fumaça, fumaça
A gente quer fumaça
A gente quer fumaça
Mas se eu der a fumaça, vocês vão aguentar?
A gente quer fumaça
Mas se eu der a fumaça, vocês vão aguentar?
A gente quer fumaça
Mas se eu der a fumaça, vocês vão aguentar?
A gente quer fumaça
Vocês querem a fumaça?
A gente quer fumaça
Vocês querem a fumaça?
A gente quer fumaça
Mas se eu der a fumaça, vocês vão aguentar?
A gente quer fumaça

Queridinho, quando eu te pegar
Eu vou pisar na tábua contigo
Fumar, beber, queimar erva até que a gente apague
Porque eu (te quero)
Queridinho, quando eu dirijo, eu dirijo sujo
O registro não está funcionando
Fumar, beber, tomar a poção, você pode me ver derrapando
Porque eu (te quero)
(Eu te quero mais do que você sabe)
Eu lembro que você me levou pro shopping semana passada, baby
Você me olhou nos olhos quatro, cinco vezes
Até eu ficar hipnotizado, e depois você explicou
Que eu (te quero)
Você disse que a Sherane não é nada perto da Lúci
Eu disse "Tá maluco?"
Rosas são vermelhas, violetas são azuis
Mas a gente vai catar margaridas se eu (te quiser)
Queridinho, quando eu te pegar
Eu vou pisar na tábua contigo
Fumar, beber, queimar erva até que a gente apague
Porque eu (te quero)
Você me disse que seu nome era Lúci
Eu disse "Cadê o Ricardo?"
Você disse "Não, não é que nem na novela"
E você mandou uma rima pra mim tipo assim
Quando eu completei vinte e seis, eu fiquei tipo "Carai"
Você me disse, eu lembro o que você me disse, você disse:
"Meu nome é Lúci, Kendrick, você me apresentou, Kendrick
Eu não costumo fazer isso mas eu vejo nós dois, Kendrick
Lúci não te preocupa, Lúci tem milhões de estórias
Sobre esses rappers que eu fui atrás quando eles eram palha
Lúci vai encher seus bolsos
Lúci vai tirar sua mamãe de Compton
E por na mansão gigante que eu prometi
Lúci só quer sua confiança e lealdade. Me evitar?
Não é tão fácil, eu tô nessas reuniões constantemente
Kendrick, Lúci não perde tempo, Lúci trabalha duro
Lúci vai te chamar mesmo sabendo que você ama seu Pai
Eu sou Lúci, eu ouvi umas oraçõezinhas no primeiro albúm, sério
Lúci não liga porque no fim das contas você vai vir atrás de mim
Lúci vai atrás, Lúci não é tímido, Lúci tem peito
Lúci tem papelada em cima de papelada
Quero que você saiba que Lúci é seu parça
Eu te observei sua vida inteira
E agora você já é grandinho pra assinar esse contrato, se for possível"
Quando eu te pegar
Eu vou pisar na tábua contigo
Fumar, beber, queimar erva até que a gente apague
Porque eu (te quero)
Queridinho, quando eu dirijo, eu dirijo sujo
O registro não está funcionando
Fumar, beber, tomar a poção, você pode me ver derrapando
Porque eu (te quero)
Eu lembro que você estava conflituado
Usando sua influência da forma errada
Algumas vezes eu fiz o mesmo
Abusei do meu poder, cheio de rancor
Rancor que se tornou uma profunda depressão
Me encontrei gritando num quarto de hotel
Eu não quis me auto-destruir
Os males de Lúci estavam ao meu redor
Então eu corri atrás de perguntas
Até que cheguei em casa
Eu lembro que você estava conflituado
Usando sua influência da forma errada
Algumas vezes eu fiz o mesmo
(Mulher gemendo)
Se essas paredes falassem
Se essas paredes falassem
Se essas paredes falassem
Se essas paredes falassem
Se essas paredes falassem
Se essas paredes falassem...
Sexo
Se essas paredes falassem, elas me diriam pra nadar bem
Sem barco, eu flutuo melhor do que outrem
Sem colete salva-vidas, não sou o Deus de Nazaré
Mas seu dilúvio pode não ser entendido bem
Paredes me dizem que são cheias de dor e ressentimento
Precisam de alguém vivendo nelas pra aliviar a tensão
E eu sou só um inquilino
A senhoria disse que essas paredes vivem vazias
Essas paredes são vulneráveis, exclamação
Interior rosa, cordenado por cor
Eu interroguei cada prego e parafuso
Tipo, foi incrível até elas não conseguirem mais me aguentar
Essas paredes querem chorar
Essas paredes vão se alegrar quando eu chegar
Essas paredes não conseguem se segurar
Toda vez que eu chego, a demolição é capaz de desabar
Se essas paredes falassem, elas me diriam pra ir fundo
Gritando comigo o tempo todo, eu presumo
Que seu mecanismo de defesa é minha decisão
Derrubar essas paredes é minha religião
Paredes sentem que estão prontas para se fechar
Eu me sufoco e depois retomo o ar
Eu ressoo nessas paredes
Não sei quanto tempo posso esperar dentro dessas paredes
Estive nas ruas por tanto tempo
Te observando do exterior
Elas cantam a mesma velha música
Sobre como essas paredes são as mais limpas
Eu discordo, eu devo tê-las perdido
Não estou envolvido, prefiro ofendê-las
Eu prefiro te ligar, sua parede é melhor levantar
Porque toda vez que eu chego, a demolição é capaz de desabar
Se suas paredes falassem, elas diriam que é tarde demais
Seu destino, aceite, seu futuro
Queime os acessórios e esconda-os no pátio
Pegue a receita, a Bíblia e Deus
Paredes te dizendo que os mantimentos estão acabando
Uma guerra racial acontecendo, nada de chamar o guarda
Nada de chamar a mamãe pra te salvar
Manos te dizendo que você é irrepetível, inaceitável
Você se comporta que nem um cão louco
Um assassino que virou cagueta
As paredes me dizem que você é um Zé buceta
Você reza por apelos, esperando que o diretor aceite
Essa sentença é importante
Paredes me dizem que você ouve 'Sing About Me'
Retaliação é real, você até sonha comigo
Matou meu maninho mas Deus poupou sua vida
Criminoso escroto foi indiciado na mesma noite
Então quando ouvir essa música, lembre do primeiro verso
Sobre mim abusando do meu poder pra que você machuque
Sobre eu e ela no choveiro quando ela sente tesão
Sobre eu e ela depois de uma noite de diversão
Sobre o pai do filho dela cumprindo perpétua
E sobre como ela pensa em ti até o nosso encontro de noite
Sobre a única garota que se importou contigo quando você precisou
E sobre ela fodendo com um rapper famoso
As paredes falam...
Eu lembro que você estava conflituado
Usando sua influência da forma errada
Algumas vezes eu fiz o mesmo
Abusei do meu poder, cheio de rancor
Rancor que se tornou uma profunda depressão
Me encontrei gritando num quarto de hotel
O-orange laces, for my shoestrings
Pistol on me, dope is in her g-string
Ridin' in my mothafuckin' Coupe-Ville
Groovin' with my mothafuckin' locs still
I'm sick wit' it but it'll still take ten of y'all
To take the Emperor's temperature
Can I represent wit' ya?
Smokin' hemp wit' ya
Pass the blunt from East to West
Cube to KRS (yes)
Take it from the Don
Where I'm from the Man of Steel is made of teflon
Keep yo' vest on
Hit me with yo' best one baby
And watch me mack you
Comin' through with hard *** Shaq-Fu
Never up in Spago's when we knock hoes
Head her off with some Reeboks and cagos
Westside rollin' even if the car's stolen
Even if my eyes shut and jaw swollen
That's how it's goin' down
You always smile when I frown
Cause you want the crown
You fuckin' clown
I keep it real no more beef with Cypress Hill
Now we super friends makin' super ends
O-orange laces, for my shoestrings
Pistol on me, dope is in her g-string
Ridin' in my mothafuckin' Coupe-Ville
Groovin' with my mothafuckin' locs still
Fig side niggas keep a dope fiend
Ghetto bird here to kill our ghetto hoop dreams
Tryna strike me out before I finish school
I was just a square nigga 'til I took my 52, oh, yeah, ayy
To sweep with the feet when he hit the concrete
Chop him up, dice him up and sacrifice his meat
Drag him by his ankles to the cemetary
Shut the fuck up nigga
Cause you ain't seen shit
I'm 'bout to take this blade and staight up grip
I'm holdin' the neck of the devil and drink his blood
Allowing my soul to be polluted by his evil root
And now I'm mad insane, red as rose as I strain for my hearbeat
To thumpety-thump to pump, it might burst
False alarms, and no harm that will commit to the E
But now I'm down to an hour 23
Time is moving fast, but not that slow
I thought I had an hour, but it's seconds left the go
I ran into the office
No more time is left
I ran up to the doctor with a bomb to my (BOOM)
Pistol on me, dope is in her g-string
Ridin' in my mothafuckin' Coupe-Ville
Groovin' with my mothafuckin' locs still
Fig side niggas keep a dope fiend
Ghetto bird here to kill our ghetto hoop dreams
Tryna strike me out before I finish school
I was just a square nigga 'til I took my 52, oh, yeah, ayy
Jay Rock, K.Dot, yeah we keep the place jumping
Girls on floor straight grinding, humping
Subs in the back yeah the speakers straight bumping
Start set trippin' then my boys start dumping
Fuck casual, looking smooth in my whitey
Back in the days, yeah them girls they like me
I rolled with Doom Dog, now they all on my cock B
All wanna watch me
All wanna jock me
Take 'em and send 'em straight to bed
When they stop me
Have 'em with sheets over their head, like a Nazi
Wax on, wax off, Mr Miyagi
Let me know momma, I show you where your thighs be
Stick in all the time just like an IV
Your so called thick shit, that don't surprise me
O-orange laces, for my shoestrings
Pistol on me, dope is in her g-string
Ridin' in my mothafuckin' Coupe-Ville
Groovin' with my mothafuckin' locs still
Fig side niggas keep a dope fiend
Ghetto bird here to kill our ghetto hoop dreams
Tryna strike me out before I finish school
I was just a square nigga 'til I took my 52, oh, yeah, ayy
From my eyewitness binoculars (uh-huh)
To Argentina and Africa (uh-huh)
We mastered the (what?) pressure (yeah)
Hazardous (uh-huh), harassing us (that's right)
You laugh at us (you did)
More accurate at bagging dimes, now we bagging rhymes
Bodybags, price tags on your forehead
Nine times out of ten, young niggas are nine or ten
When the line becomes thin: be a killer or fireman
Fill up the lavish pen if I needed to right my wrongs
I can't deny sin, condolences through these palms
I remember when your cousin was coming home
My bitch, why we plotted to kill him 'cause we ain’t know him
Unfamiliar faces make niggas nervous
Convicted court cases might hit the surface
Restricted territories might come through lurkin’
We ain't want none of that urgent call
Well, I’ma act Turk and fall on my identity, percocets
For all the headaches, I'm 'bout to bring confetti
Tumble out this barrel soon as it ring, you ready?
That was the word 'for we moved on ’em
Treat him like Joe the Plumber
I wonder if someone come and can see this tool on him
Immature and retarded is what you call me
Your cousin wa'n't coming home from the pen but from the army
If I can right my wrongs and pen this verse I read
Even though a bullet hit him in the leg, still walk on by
For enomies, you feel the energy
We near infinity, we're timeless
You can't defend, you fake, you so pretend
When I'm in my zone, you know I'm going all night
Touch an NBA live wire and get burned
Going crazy, now they calling, calling
Living like this, you know we flawless
Used to ride ruggid, now I ride plush
You ride the Benz, I ride GT's and up
I'm cool like 5 ice cubes in my cup
Ballin out of control, like an offencive
Matter fact, you should follo my word
Footprints, so you know I came
Going crazy, now they calling, calling
Living like this, you know we flawless
Hard to stop, climbing like a mountain top
Swish, serving like your favorite dish
In the game, EA Sports
I'm the reason why we won
Nobody pray for me
Even a day for me
Well
I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finessin' 'em all with some counterfeits
But now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives
In fact I'm downin' this
D'usse with my boo bae
Tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good
Won't you sit it on my taste bloods
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block
Then break it down we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M. funk
Piss out your per diem, now you gotta hate 'em funk
If I quit your BM I still ride Mercedes funk
If I quit this season I still be the greatest funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put a baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
There's levels to it, you and I know, bitch, be humble
Sit Down
Be Humble
Sit Down
Be Humble
Sit Down
Be Humble
Sit Down
Be Humble
Sit Down

Who that motha' fucka' think he frontin' on man?
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the sandman
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fuckin' up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of that Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on a Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretchmarks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
This shit way too crazy
You do not amaze me
I blew cool from AC
Obama just paged me
I don't fabricate it
Most of y'all be fakin'
I stay modest 'bout it
She elaborate it
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk
Watch my soul speak
You let the meds talk
If I kill a motha' fucka' won't be alcohol
I'm the realest one after all
Bitch be humble
Sit Down
Be Humble
Sit Down
Be Humble
Sit Down

Nobody pray for me
Even a day for me

I want you
To live in my bed
Why don't you
Just live in my bed
Then I can wake up
To your face
Whenever I open up my eyes
So why don't you just live in my bed
Pack your bags
Come get away baby don't look back
I got a pillow with your name on it
Don't hesitate to put your head on it
Just stay the weekend
My bed will make you want to move in
If you wanna we can sleep in
Baby here's a proposition
Listen
I want you
To live in my bed
Why don't you
Just live in my bed
Then I can wake up
To your face
Whenever I open up my eyes
So why don't you just live in my bed
Baby come here
Hit the freeway then I switch gears
Drive pass to it, let my love pass through it
We'd be living in the mist of the wonder years
We can hear the drop of tears
Every time we drop the top
Do it anywhere, do it here, do it there
Leave the mall and do it in a parking lot
Ooo, you look so sexy
Not to many impress me
Then she reply
"My God, boy, shut the fuck up and just undress me"
Damn you're gorgeous
Runnin' circles in my head
Now baby girl, pack your bags and catch a cab
I want you
To live in my bed
Why don't you
Just live in my bed
Then I can wake up
To your face
Whenever I open up my eyes
So why don't you just live in my bed
K-Dot, atende o telefone, nego
Toda vez que eu ligo cai na caixa postal
Nego, não me diz que eles te arrastaram pra aquela parada de rap
Vai parar de usar meia e jeans apertado?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha
Me liga no celular da Shaniqua!
Eu sou N°1 desde o dia um, vocês pretos boo boo
Seu mano, o bloco de onde você vem? Boo boo
As putinhas com quem você estudou? Boo boo
Sua patroa e sua ninfeta? Boo boo
A gente tava na quebrada, 14 anos com canos
14 anos depois, dando duro que nem a gente fazia com os falecidos manos
Os falecidos manos
Tô pouco me fudendo sobre política no rap, mermão
Meu maninho Stunna Deuce nunca vai voltar, mermão
Então é melhor dar duro toda vez que por a mão na massa, mermão
Foda-se o que eles dizem, você conhece a si mesmo, mermão
Chegou no jogo, você afundou as garras nesse jogo
Você não usou corrente nesse jogo, seu bairro, seu nome nesse jogo
Agora você multiplica, hora de partir o pão e juntar a multidão
Seguir o roteiro faz as verdinhas aparecerem
Cima, baixo, esquerda, direita, correndo de meia branca
É tipo "Baseado, acende aí"
Esse é o cheiro do produto quando os químicos se misturam
Salve dos '50 Nigga', saindo do zoológico Compton, com os extras:
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, e Dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicanos, eles tão contigo
Asiáticos tão contigo, agora ninguém mexe contigo
Eu sou N°1 desde o dia um, vocês pretos boo boo
Seu mano, o bloco de onde você vem? Boo boo
As putinhas com quem você estudou? Boo boo
Sua patroa e sua ninfeta? Boo boo
A gente tava na quebrada, 14 anos com canos
14 anos depois, dando duro que nem a gente fazia com os falecidos manos
Os falecidos manos
Saí do Cadilaque, meu pau acabou de ser chupado
Os maninhos ligaram dizendo "O inimigo tá preparado"
Ah é? Os putos querem mexer com meu bairro?
Ah é? A gente faz eles correrem tipo cárdio
Ah é? É tudo preto no branco, é escandaloso
Ambulâncias em câmera lenta, os projetos são cheios de câmeras
O departamento de polícia se arrisca mas abafa, as sentenças chovem
Nomes de manos no registro, você caguetou o verão todo
As ruas não falham comigo, elas dizem que há uma nova gangue na cidade
De Compton a Congress, briga de gangues por todo lado
Nada de novo exceto uma onda de Demo-Crips e Re-Blood-icanos
Estado vermelho versus estado azul, qual você governa?
Eles nos dão armas e drogas porque somos bandidos
E prometem foder contigo
Sem camisinha, eles fodem contigo; diz aí Obama, e agora?
Diz aí Obama, e agora?
Diz aí Obama, e agora?
Diz aí Obama, e agora?
Eu sou N°1 desde o dia um, vocês pretos boo boo
Seu mano, o bloco de onde você vem? Boo boo
As putinhas com quem você estudou? Boo boo
Sua patroa e sua ninfeta? Boo boo
A gente tava na quebrada, 14 anos com canos
14 anos depois, dando duro que nem a gente fazia com os falecidos manos
Os falecidos manos
Todo mundo quer falar sobre quem isso e quem aquilo
Quem é mais presença e quem tá moscando, quem é negro e quem é branco
Críticos ficam falando que eles sentem saudades de quando hip-hop era sobre rima
Caralho, se fosse verdade, o Killer Mike tinha platina
Suas prioridades são foda, vocês põem energia na coisa errada
Hennessy e Crown Vic, minha memória sumiu desde então
Não me pergunta sobre bloquear câmeras em cerimônias
Não me pergunta sobre minha mina, não me pergunta sobre meu carro
A não ser que pergunte sobre poder, então sim, eu tenho de montão
Eu sou o único preto perto do Snoop que poder apertar o botão
Deixei a Costa apreensiva
“K. Dot, qualé? Ouvi dizer que abriram a Caixa de Pandora”
Eu encaixoto eles na mesma hora
Qualé mano, a gente é sensível demais, isso vaza nas ruas
Eu faço uma ligação e a Costa se envolove, a história se repete
Mas eu resolvi isso dentro de um salão privado, conversando com o Jay
Ele disse "Engraçado como um verso pode foder com o jogo inteiro"
Eu sou N°1 desde o dia um, vocês pretos boo boo
Eu lembro que você estava conflituado
Usando sua influência da forma errada
Algumas vezes eu fiz o mesmo
Abusei do meu poder, cheio de rancor
Rancor que se tornou uma profunda depressão
Me encontrei gritando num quarto de hotel
Eu não quis me auto-destruir
Os males de Lúci estavam ao meu redor
Então eu corri atrás de perguntas
Até que cheguei em casa
Mas isso não parou a culpa do sobrevivente
Indo pra lá e pra cá tentando me convencer dos luxos que eu ganhei
Ou talvez o quão primeira classe eu me tornei
Mas enquanto meus queridos estavam lutando a guerra contínua na cidade
Eu estava entrando em uma nova
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?
I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh
I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh
Say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Big shot (hol' up, wait)
Peanut butter insides

I want some top from like two sets of twins
Twinnie twin twins, yeah, yeah
Ayy, bitch (bitch), where your friends? Yeah, yeah

Ball 'em in, fallin' in bundles of flowers like parliament
Never know, big dawg like ours
Whethan, Louis
Whethan, Louis
Ayy, I am the truth
Ayy, I am the wisdom of the fallen; I'm the youth
Ayy, I am the greatest
Ayy, this is the proof
Ayy, I work hard, pray hard, pay dues, ayy
I transform with pressure, I'm hands-on with effort
I fell twice before, my bounce back was special
Letdowns'll get you, and the critics'll test you
But the strong'll survive, another scar may bless you, ah

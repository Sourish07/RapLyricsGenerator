I don't get excited about the fame
Bitch I'm still with the same gang, bitch I still claim the same thing
Still take a pussy nigga chain
Man I feel like I deserve this shit
I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip
She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch
These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't have me grind for this shit
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes
Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more
12 can't arrest me no more, ain't no roaches on the floor
Ain't no flowers in this clique, ain't no flowers in this shit
We done cut the snakes off, had to cut them niggas off
Niggas don't wanna see you with nothing, unless you giving these niggas something
I had to get me some money, bitch and that drum hold a hunnid
You run up, you know that I'm gunning, 2Pac nigga, thugging
A lot of niggas changed on me, I just bought some chains on me
I just bought a Range Rover, this shit ain't 'bout the fame homie
Mookie told me I deserve it, momma told me I deserve it
I know if Tayman was alive, he would tell me I deserved it
I got the sack and start splurgin', balling like I'm James Worthy
Pussy niggas ain't worth it, before I did some other murders
Man I feel like I deserve this shit
I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip
She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch
These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't have me grind for this shit
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes
Ain't no more selling no dope (no dope), 12 can't arrest me no more (no more)

Drop my nuts and let'em hang, nigga I'm gang
Two revolvers on my waist, John Wayne
Fucking this ratchet bitch I made "?"
Nigga I keep the shit, louis king nine
Yeah, pop the shit
Yeah,rich nigga convo
Nigga, talk that shit
Yah, sipping out syrup I don't need cough up shit
Yah, real shooters with me like the chalk up shit
Nigga real talk, got a real bowl and a real fork
Whip real hard, this a real sword
Bitch I'm Slaughter Gang, we hit real hard
Nigga we don't know y'all boys
Y'all ain't making no noise
Hang with real trappers, nigga we ain't doing no "?"
Got a Christian Lou' fetish, count a lotta lettuce
Bank account heavy, money long and I'm deadly
Oh my God, still hanging in the six, nigga
Oh my God, and I came from selling this, nigga
Oh my God, Savage made a couple hits, nigga
Oh my God, but I'm known for sending hits, nigga
Oh my God, I might do the "?", nigga
Oh my God, (?) on the street, nigga
Oh my God, I act a asshole, bitch boy
Got me back in Savage Mode
(2x)
Nigga we don't know y'all boys
Y'all ain't making no noise
Hang with real trappers, nigga we ain't doing no "?"
Got a Christian Lou' fetish, count a lotta lettuce
Bank account heavy, money long and I'm deadly
“They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving this crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving this crew”
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Let me tell you a truth
It is amazing what this game could do to you
Fake cold may lose your soul too
And if you a fuu, the hook can get you though
If you knew what I do
What I went through
Thank you to the crew, I salute you
And if you go, I will give you a 21 salute as if you are camo
And we are good fellas mixed with regular dudes
So who knows if it could be me or you to salute
Like they say in the marines
Everyone wants to go to heaven
But no one wants to go with sleep’s cousin
And with death, it is not the greatest loss, but the greatest loss is what dies inside while still alive
And that is far worse crime if it kills time
But I guess it is also good to go with pride
And I want to express what’s inside outside but my enemies want to see my insides outside and I got to bottle it up and make whatever outside inside
Let me tell you a truth
It is amazing what this game could do to you
Fake cold may lose your soul too
And if you a fuu, the hook can get you though
If you knew what I know
What I went through
Thank you to the crew, I salute you
And if you go, I will give you a 21 salute as if you are camo
And we are good fellas mixed with regular dudes
So who knows if it could be me or you to salute
Where is your backbone, or your code at
A paradox that that make the real die quick
It’s hard to separate friends from enemies
Always show love but in their hearts they envy me and wait for the right opportunity to backstab me
Ride for me but still sell me
I got to ask dogs cause they have better answers than those snakes in disguise
But I guess righteous choices don’t pay no more and only god knows
But I promise for my crew I will hold you down
Let me tell you a truth
It is amazing what this game could do to you
Fake cold may lose your soul too
And if you a fuu, the hook can get you though
If you knew what I know
What I went through
Thank you to the crew, I salute you
And if you go, I will give you a 21 salute as if you are camo
And we are good fellas mixed with regular dudes
So who knows if it could be me or you to salute
Headstart, ready for war, raise your sword and play with fire
War without failure with a taste of pleasure and pain
Change the system, new gen revolution
Shifting powers, new forms of throne
Fear of getting out the zone
Pressure of making the right move
Play it wrong, you may lose your soul too
I'd rather have loyalty than love
'Cause love really don't mean jack
See love is just a feeling
You can love somebody and still stab them in they back
It don't take much to love
You can love somebody just by being attached
See loyalty is a action
You can love or hate me and still have my back
And they all dirty (Ayy look inside the 'frigerator)
My 'frigerator full of sodas and they all dirty (Try to grab me a soda)

Gwiazda rozjebała Ci cipe, więc może zrób waginoplastykę z Izą Pizą
Razem z Kejti Ci pokażemy, kto tu jest gwiazdami, a kto śmieciami
Moja Epka rozjebie Ci cipe, a ja ci zaśpiewam
Ja Gwiazda spadam ci na dywan czerwony
Może Grammy, może MTV, nie wiem
Chuj mnie to interesuje, ważne, że jestem z moją psiapasi, Kejti
I razem rozjebiemy ten muzyczny świat
Piosenka roku jest moja
Cipa roku jest moja
Dupa i Cyce roku też są moje
Wszystkie Nagrody moje, więc te kurwy stoją i się patrzą
Jaka kurwa jestem zajebista, później cyk w mięso się ubieram i cie rozbieram
Ale masz wielkiego penisa
Później na after party idziemy z Kejti Ci, co umiem śpiewać, ruchać i twerkować umiemy
Więc inne suki patrzą jak nasze dupe i cipy latają
I po chwili widzę je, Kardi i s00ke, więc lecę się przywitać, ale widzę, że z mordy nie te
Więc stwierdziłam, że je pomaluję moimi kosmetykami Hause Twojastarara
Gdzie cena jest dojebana
Stupid Love od Gagi się wyjebało, bo nie umie trzymać piosenki jak ja
Stupid to ona jest jedyna, ale kurwa nie zaczynam
I dostałe zaproszenie, żeby poprowadzić PornHub Awards
I stwierdziłam, że jeszcze mnie tam nie było i poprowadzę tę gale
Pokaże wam mą cipę i sławę
Którą wywróżyła mi pewna gwiazda
Miała na imię Zenek Martyniuk, tak, tak ta gwiazda Disco Polo
I spytałam czy będę mogła znaleźć się w dokumencie TVP o nim
Ale odpowiedział nie
A teraz na carpet wchodzi Kejti i Ci pokaże, kto tu jest hot, a kto not
Idę na dywan czerwony, chociaż w tamtym mnie nie wpuścili
W tym roku w strefie VIP się znajduję
Igi w śmietniku buszuje
Lejdi Zgaga nową EPke wydaje, więc status Gwiazdy dostaje
Bo jesteśmy gwiazdami, będziemy legendami
Pokrywamy się platynami, nawet diamentami
Igi Azalija śni o tym tytule
My jesteśmy lepsze jako duet
Jak z Gwiazdami zadzieracie, to się nie pozbieracie
Lepiej ściągaj swoje gacie, nikt nas nie pobije
Będziemy lśnić na swe czasy, kto nas zhejtuje pójdzie do Syberi na wakacje
Koniec kotku, bo Gwiazd nikt nie pokona
Razem z innymi jestem nie pokonana
Moja Kochana
Ale i też trochę wyruchana, a teraz dwie gwiazdy idą chlać
Więc Kejti, Zgaga mówią wam pa

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol
Sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade, I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward, nigga, 2016
And I'm screamin' fuck a deal
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon
"Savage, I was just playin'"
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch, I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
"Come on, man, Savage, you know I always play your mixtape"
Yeah, nigga, fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon
Lil Dick, I mean Lil Hoe
Nah, Joe, for real, dissing me
I ain't dipping out, I ain't missing
I'm alive, killing the flow, waiting for you to pop some pills
Why you slipping, pussy boy
Never forgiving, whipping the beat
I got the heat, wishing you were better
Sticking, pissing Mez, woah, woah
Where the fuck is Mez, cause we winning
Here is a dead letter to your life
I know you ain't hiding, tryna enter the game
Off flow, while I grow, I'm glowing, woah, woah
Lame bitch, never could pleasure a bitch
Tryna measure, shit never work out
Is it true
Luis just support your music, cause your dad is his teacher
Why not, put a beater as a feature
You're just a dreamer of nature
I'm just the reaper in your mind, while you have a seizure
You need a breather, cause I'm the leader
You're just a believer, I still kill you while having a fever
Like I'm an Bieber fan, I'm the achiever
Fuck off, you diva
Creeper looking ass, cheap ass acting deep
Run you over with a jeep, broken legs
Asleep, bloody throat
Tryna ride a bike pegs, but you fall on your head like threads
You better hike
Lil Joe
You a hoe
Nigga you are unknown
Told me to pull so you could shoot me with your 30
Told your fat ass ex that she looks like a rollie polly
So I put a rollie on my wrist
You just got the clout from a rapper in the K
I swear to god all these niggas you claim they are lame
You called my boy out talking about how he just want the fame
But last time I checked we let it rain on your name
I wanna know who the fuck puts lil in their name
Most rappers with lil in, their name is lame
Might as well call you Stuart Little fucking dork
Crawl back in your hole, and wish it was gone
Savon hopped on the beat
Hope is on it too
It's not my fault that you wanted to lose
Put this shit on repeat cause we won
No more sneak peek
Wrapped my hands around your song
Chocked the fuck out of it
So you could use vocals harder
Lil bitch
Lil bitch
Joe is a lil bitch
10 bad bitches in a mansion
Wrist on Milly Rock them diamonds on me dancin'
When you workin' hard then your money start expandin'
I got model bitches wanna lick me like some candy
And them drugs come in handy
Last name Savage bitch, but no I'm not Randy
Hit her with no condom, had to make her eat a plan B
And I'm sippin' on that Codeine, not Brandy
I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch
I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch
Hold up, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch
Hold up, I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch
Fuck a wedding ring, I bought a necklace
Diamonds got the flu, try not to catch this
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)
I'm just flexin on my ex-bitch
I'm just stuntin on my ex bitch
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)
I left that hoe alone 'cause she was ratchet (21)

Many me presto la Draco
Que tiene en su casa
Clava en la nevera
Aunque lo tiro chipean
Y salen caliente
Tu piel te congela
Tamo todito rodeado manito
Vakea como se trotea
Tengo lo punto ubicado
La shorty no falla desde la azotea
Yo subo pa' la azotea
Le tiro a la shorty
Ella me lo menea
Bajamos pa’ la cocina
Prendemos la vaina
Y ella me culea
Tamo esperando por Kiubbah
Que viene bajando lo kilo
Y lo gramo y si todo sale bien
Y nadie se no vira lo 3 coronamos
Hey ya yo llegue con la merca
Y la AKA y la 40 guarda en el baúl
Por si me pegan un tiro en el camino
El puerco se llama Raúl hey
Pa' no dormir manejando en la noche
Tuve que beberme un Red Bull
Pasamos la trucka de estado en estado
Parece que andamos en un tour
Me dien un dos tres
Cuatro cinco seis siete
Ocho tiros
Y no me an pegao
Y no me an pegao
Y no me an pegao
Y no me an pegao
Y no me an pegao
Y andamos burlao
Un dos tres
Cuatro cinco seis siete
Ocho nueve
Millones Guardao
Millones Guardao
Millones Guardao
Millones Guardao
Millones Guardao
Y un kilo cortao
Le pase lo kilo a Many Malón
Pa que allá lo venda en su pueblito
La gente de Apollo nunca fue a la Luna
La NASA nos mintió a todito
Yo no doy gracias cuando estoy
Comiendo ni aunque mi mama cocino
Tantos niñitos que se están muriendo
Porque no lo ayuda su "Dios"?
Antes la tierra redonda
Ahora dicen dique plana
La luna era grandota
Ahora una bombilla enana
Disque pa irte pa el cielo
Debe ser testigo o ser un cristiano
De tanto que desirforman ya pronto
Dirán que Colon era Haitiano
El dolor de Venezuela
No lo transmiten ni Primer Impacto
No se si es Maduro o Estado Unidos
Pa quedarse con el mandato
Mucho violadores mucho asesinato
Algunos padres son patos
El consejero del Papa Francisco
En el vaticano tenia un desacato
Un dos tres
Cuatro cinco seis siete
Ocho tiros
Y no me an pegao
Y no me an pegao
Y no me an pegao
Y no me an pegao
Y no me an pegao
Y andamos burlao
Un dos tres
Cuatro cinco seis siete
Ocho nueve
Millones Guardao
Millones Guardao

Millones Guardao
Millones Guardao

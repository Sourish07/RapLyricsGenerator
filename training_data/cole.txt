First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it."
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (Nigga, you know how it go)

Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
Got me up all night
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night
Constant drinkin' and love songs
Down-and-out with these love songs
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song "Dreams" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—
And we are, we are, we are
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, "Give me twenty dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—
Got me up all night (All night)
She got me up all night (All night)
Back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
*Space Bar Tap*
Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time, she was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?"
Damn…
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before," knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…
You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick!"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, "I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—"
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?
This one goes out to all sides worldwide
Let that playa-ass nigga Thumpy be your guide
As we go on a ride
Where playa-hatin' killers and hood niggas thrive
And lame muh'fuckers can barely survive
You need a nigga that's gon' come over and dig you out
You need a nigga that you know is not gon' run his mouth
You need a nigga when he done probably gon' put you out
You need a nigga that's gon' put it in your mouth
Dick so big, it's like a foot is in yo mouth
And you ain't babysittin' but my kids all on your couch
And oh, you nasty, oh, oh, you nasty
Both graduated, so fuck keepin' it classy
Look, they love me in the Chi like MJ
They love me in the Chi like Oprah
No nigga could block, not even Dikembe
Compared to Cole, boy, you're softer than a sofa
And so far, my new shit's so fire, nigga, check my profile
Who you know make waves in the low tide?
Deebo'd yo bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, little brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thing in my bed
Been a long time since I had to ask for head
So goddamn, don't make me beg
But I will if I need to, 'cause for real, girl, I need you
I could put you on a flight, we could take off tonight
If you scared of heights, shit, I got a pill I could feed you
Cole!
You good, T-Minus?
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga
Huh, ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Ayy, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine
Better holla 'cause you know they bout to cut the lights on
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising
Love yours
No such thing
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing, no such thing
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
Compared to some of my niggas
Down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better
(think being broke was better)
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I ask for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours
Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga
I break it on down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down, I br-
Hollywood Cole, go
Ayy, Hollywood, ayy, Hollywood Cole, go
My nigga done went Hollywood
You wanna know just where I'm at? Well, let me tell you 'bout it
I put my city on the map, but let me tell you 'bout it
They tryna say I can't come back, ayy, let me tell you 'bout it
Man, fuck them niggas, I come back, ayy, let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it: hands up, everybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like, "Man, that's what everybody said"
Go and pop the trunk and everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga, aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter, never bitter
Niggas is fake, they anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, whoa
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake, uh
Fuck good, nigga, we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait
The best kept secret
Even Hov tried to keep it and I leaked the damn tape, uh
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe
I said, to the window, to the wall (To the wall)
My nigga ride when I call (I call)
Got bitches all in my mind (My mind)
Fuck nigga blockin' my shine (My shine)
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me
Get off my dick, whoa
(Get the fuck off my dick)
(Get the fuck off my dick, nigga)
Get off my dick, bitch, whoa
Man, fuck them niggas, I come home and I don't tell nobody
They gettin' temporary dough and I don't tell nobody
Lord, will you tell me if I changed? I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody
This is the part that the thugs skip!
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowin' bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' 'bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through, the break up
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won’t be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie, it's just 1 Thing about 'em
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more, no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(Nigga, I don't sing about this shit no more)
But every nigga in the club singin'
To the window, to the wall (To the wall)
Get off my dick
Singin' this song, yeah
Got all the bitches in the club singin'
And all they mamas let their kids sing it
Sing this song, yeah
The baby mamas and the mistresses
This song, yeah, song, yeah
Song, yeah, song-song, yeah
The make up
This shit is retarded, goddamn
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous?
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless?
Uh, that's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Aerial Heights
Here's a scenario:
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah, fuck nigga, I'm very sure, heh
Fuck the rest, I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home, I'm the best in the South
When I'm in L.A., I'm the best in the West
You contest? You can test, I'ma stretch niggas out
Ooh, I'ma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for everybody on my testicles
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho
Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy
She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
She my number one I don't need nothing on the side
I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that
Kevin's Heart
They tell me "What's done in the dark
Will find a way to shine"
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
What's done in the dark will always find a way to shine
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved
Go, go, go
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as shit
Wow, niggas been crampin' my style
Blowin' my high, they want a reply
The number one question is, "How?"
How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?
How 'bout you just get the fuck off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'll dip
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my shit
Haven't you heard? I'm as cold as the tip
Tip of the iceberg that tipped the Titanic
No tip-toein' around it, my shit is gigantic
As big as the fuckin' Atlantic, I'm lit, bitch
How I grew up, only few would've loved
'Member I got my first view of the blood
I'm hangin' out and they shoot up the club
My homie got pharmaceutical plug
I smoke the drug and it run through my vein
I think it's workin', it's numbin' the pain
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this shit daily, sipped so much Actavis
I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
Platinum wrist ridin' in back like Miss Daisy
Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lack-sical-daisy
My nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
Know a young nigga, he actin' so crazy
He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him
Bitches been askin', "What have you done lately?"
I stacked a few M's like my last name was Shady
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me
Power, greed
Money, Molly, weed
Percs, Xannys, lean, fame
And the strongest drug of them all
Love
Yeah (For your eyes)
For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know?
How could you know? How could you know?
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is nigga, run that shit!)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
I'm loving your light, vulnerable
Letting your guard down, it's honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that
Friendly to you, but there’s magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
And keep alive in the winter time, ayy, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me
I could take the weight up off your shoulderblades
And try to store the pain inside of me
Ayy, why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you God-sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneaking glances, thanking God that he drew you like that
Beautiful Black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile, I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix
Before I had you, this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beating you smart, 'cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord
Say she from the west side, mmm
And she see my best side, mmm
Mmm
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
'pologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Well, motherfucker, I am
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn
Don't follow me
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
Well motherfucker, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, woah
Woah, woah
Oh
(You good, T-Minus?)
Yeah, circumnavigate the globe as the cash grows (Grow)
Get a nigga whacked like you get the grass mowed (Mowed)
I'm talkin' slick when I'm with the Big Slime, nigga (Slime)
Could hit your bitch, you could never hit mine, nigga (Mine)
In my DM, they electric slide, nigga (Huh, slide)
No catfishin', this is not a fish fry, nigga
Never switch sides on my dog
Catch a contact, hitch a ride, go to Mars
Everybody sing
How could you come up out your face
And say I ain't the hardest nigga you done ever heard?
I left a flock of rappers dead and buried
A verse from me is like eleven birds
Just did the math, that's like two thousand dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some niggas and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
Then told the nigga that they gotta wait for it
"I know—I know you in high demand"
I'm ballin' on a pussy nigga like Juwanna Mann
I'm drownin' all inside the pussy like I never swam
Ayy, fuck your IG, I put somethin' on your sonogram
I'm the man, ayy, ayy
She knows
She knows, ayy
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly I’ve never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I’m gonna run run away (oh I), run run away, run away (oh I-I-I)
Run away and never come back (well all right)
Run run away, run run away (oh I), run away (oh I-I-I)
Show ‘em that your color is black (well all right)
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
But not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club
Getting dubs, with a bad bitch in his ear
Sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta
And she knows
And I know she knows
And deep down she knows
Well all right
Oh I
Oh I-I-I
I can't be what you want from me, well all right
I can’t be what you want from me, well all right
Damned if I do (shit)
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want?
What she—what she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high
Try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing I suppose
Niggas say turn up, hoes say turn up
Only bad thing 'bout a star is they burn up
Rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye (Left Eye)
Michael Jackson, I'll see ya
Just as soon as I die (I die)
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
'Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow
Don't shit last, don't shit last and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
Bitch, bitch
That should be my new ad lib
I got a new one. I finally got a cool ad lib
Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitch
Or you can do the low cool shit, bitch
I grew up, a fucking screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I?
Ayy, who am I? (Yeah)
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along, nothing to see
I always did shit the hard way
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn’t my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Ayy, who am I?
(Ayy, who am I?)
(Who am I?)
I never felt better
Awwwww...haha
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?
Hood niggas don't lie
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen...
I want to see you work out for me, work out for me
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right
Well then (Cole World)
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)
Well straight up, I tell ya
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ah, ayo, ah
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ah
Yeah
I hate rich niggas, god damn it
'Cause I ain't never had a lot, damn it
Who you had to kill? Who you had to rob?
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top, damn it?
Or maybe that's daddy money, escalator, no ladder money
Escalade, new Caddy money
Worst fear going broke cause I'm bad with money
Crooked smile nigga, momma never had the money, damn
I ain't tripping
Nigga Jordan; I ain't Pippen, yeah
Up the steps, I ain't slipping
Tears, blood, sweat, and I ain't cripping
Here's a song you can sing along with
When you down on some let you know you ain't alone shit
When your momma ain't at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas, you think she out here getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit 'bout your step-pops
How he was a dog, now look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga, plus dawg, I'm a grown man now
I ain't mad at that nigga
But if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
I'd be glad it's that nigga, nigga
Did Kay dirty now it's back to broke
Refund checks, used that to float
Momma gets depressed, falls in love with the next maniac
On crack, use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes, tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
Could've drowned, but I grabbed the rope
And there go you, and there go you, and there go you
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
Sing, you got what I want, I got what you need
"How much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want, I got what you need
Niggas can't front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie, don't quit now
Hear my shit and tried to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now, know you felt the shit just now
Ain't there more to you? Don't it ever get boring to you?
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power, fuck it more to you
Saw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for mo' money like Damon Wayans
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but this ain't the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watched little Jermaine do his thing before he made a name
It's like Sony signed Basquiat
He gave it all he got, and now a nigga don't paint the same, damn
I guess he can't complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Think of old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same
Yeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane
At least he ain't insane
You ain't crazy, motherfucker, you just afraid of change
That's new, maybe that's true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
When I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch don't feel the same no more
And Henny don't really kill the pain no more
Now I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I can't maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money can't save your soul
But there go you
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain
Choose wisely
Will I fall? Will I fly?
Heal my soul
Fulfill my high
Cross my heart (Count, count, count, count it)
And hope to die (Count, count, count, count it)
With my slice (Count, count, count, count it)
Of Devil's pie
Count it up, count it up, count it up, count it
I know that it's difficult
I'm stackin' this paper, it's sort of habitual
I blow the residual
And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math
Can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it
Can't take it when you die
Uno, dos, tres
Big bills, big bills
I fell in love with big wheels and quick thrills
My niggas runnin' tip drills, can't sit still
Don't give a fuck if it kills, it mix well
I'm only countin'
I'm only countin'...
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Proceed with caution
I heard if you chase it only results in
A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
It's only an organ
Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'
Now Cole, he important
My niggas beside me like Tommy and Martin
We ball on your court and
Then skate with your bitch like we Tonya Harding
She don't need her garments
She horny from all the money we countin'
Uno dos
Cross my heart
And hope to die
With my slice of Devil’s pie
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga
But the only real change come from inside
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—
Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah, look
The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade, for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window 'cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me 'cause I love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
'Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said 'son'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the god
Nah you ain't the god
Nigga, Cole the god (Cole the god, Cole the god)
January 28th
Make a million dollars off a rap tune
(*sound of baby laughing*)
I wanna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I'm gonna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Ay, oh, yeah
Cole world, ah, oh, yeah
Yeah, this is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama; we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato's
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing, man?
Oh yeah, to my college girl: Take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby, where your roommates?
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed, put her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories 'bout different dudes
Her man on campus, but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like four–five niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by three
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time my man is murdered; the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
I used to print out Nas' raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read them in awe
Then he dropped Stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'd a thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
And I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, "You the one, yo, why you make that shit?"
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made "You Owe Me"
Dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par
When I followed my heart
Granted, my heart was tainted
By my mind that kept on sayin'
"Where's the hits?" You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game
But on the way I let Nas down
I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core
Then I can open the door
Reintroduce them to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross
Dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose
I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it
How could you fail to respect it?
Letting Nas down, I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it
False prophets
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Yeah, false prophets
I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit and know I can top it
Sometimes I brag like Hov
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Sometimes I brag like Hov, now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Cole, time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Sometimes I brag like Hov, sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough, look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet, I'm real life hot, homie
Get your weight up, fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I don't mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot, okay, faggot?
Uh, don't be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass that's between you and whoever else's dick it is
Pause, maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya? Boy Meets World, I'm tryna find a new Topanga
And bang her out, no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James, wait a minute, that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne, say fuck it
If the hoes like it I love it, nigga, nigga, nigga
Used to watch Rap City, Big Tigga, Tigga
Rap nerd, even copped Rah Diggah, Diggah
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga, fuck Biggie
I was only like 11 so forgive me
A decade later I'd be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didn't want it it was fuck him again
One day, he gon' regret playing me
Little did I know in a year he'd be fucking paying me, what could you say to me? I
Beat the odds like Vegas, I used to rap about haters
Before niggas was hating me, now they hate to see
A young black man with a college degree
Fucking all these little models for free, pardon me
Got the game back, and I ain’t ever letting go
I'm the prince of the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas couldn't blow with C4 strapped to your belly
I snuck up out the parts where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi, Israeli
And so I'm wondering really what could you actually tell me
I'm tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So, back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon' tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops 'cause he's sorry
Fucked up education, would ask for reparations
But I’m probably just gon' go and buy Ferraris, vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the T.V. so the demons in 'em
I'm in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil, now I'm pleading with him
Like give me my soul
My nigga, I ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul
But the Devil don't play fair
I'm 'bout to go and join the Illuminati
Fuck everybody
These next three bars is dedicated to the retards
Keep on asking me about the Illuminati;
Is you stupid, nigga? Young black millionaire
Old white billionaires, I'm sure that they can do without me
And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more A's I would've been a summa cuma laude
Beyoncé told me that she want to cop the blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what I'm worth, I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward, awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward, awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
I'm praying I don't see 'em at the Oscars, Oscars
Hey J. Cole, this way, hey
Oh, hey, what's up? What's goin' on with you? Okay
Big smile, man, big smile, let me see that crooked smile
J. Cole, J. Cole, this way, look this way
Oh friend hug, friend hug, just keep it friendly
We friends, friends
Re-adjustin' my target audience, 'cause it's obvious
I've gone astray, losing my way like Timberlake
Produced by Timbaland on that goddamn FutureSex/LoveSounds
What's playing in my mind, just the sound of my whole career
Crash and burning, the thing that I mostly fear
Was on track for the first two years until I let the Devil steer
Now what have we here? Mask my tears, but I
Allow me to re-introduce myself, my name is Cole
My nigga
Born sinner
Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Hey
Spinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal
If I died today my nigga, was it business, was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we'd grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless, I saw but never noticed
That a college point us right to "Be all that you can be" posters, uh
Rest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if
This the realest shit I wrote, but know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it
And knew one day you'd come back and rewind it, singing
Yeah, this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it 'cause this music bizz is a cliff
I got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming: "Don't let me slip"
She see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you: "You the only reason why I don't flip
And go insane"; My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no
Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me
Woman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows 'em
Don't you ever go expose 'em
This life is harder than you'll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show, more for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself, I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test, but where's the tutor for me?
Pops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Can't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Except
This shit is a gift
Baby, you summertime fine
I let you get on top, I be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number nine, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wonderin' what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me
'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me
So I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', “Who was that?”
“Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?”
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine
And can I hit it in the mornin'?
Can I hit it in the mornin'?
The Sun risin' while you moanin'
Hey, God bless the child that can hold his own
God bless the woman that can hold Patron
God bless her homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you was clear
I'm learnin' not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?
Just say you're scared if you're scared
But if you through frontin', we can do somethin'
And you know just what I'm talkin' about
Tomorrow you'll be callin' out
'Cause tonight we gettin' right into the wee morn'
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way, you think about me all day
That's just a warnin'
The Sun risin' while you moanin', yeah
Yeah, we back
Back in Mohammed crib, nigga, top floor
The back room with just the one little small window, nigga
The light be comin' through it in the morning
Old-ass walls and shit
But it's just like I remember, just like I wanted it
Yeah, I'm workin'
Yeah, I'm workin', nigga
Look, it's the return of the Mr. Burn Suckers
Not herpes infested, just perfectly blessed with
A style that you can't F with, protection recommended
‘Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
You know, mass destruction when I mash the button
I take your favorite major rapper, left him independent
Cryin' in the corner
‘Cause I ain't into sorta kinda, dissin' niggas
I'm borderline addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost
Ain't no need for discussion
If they weren't talkin' 'bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil' whatever – just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4" rappers
The streets don't fuck with you, you Pitchfork rappers
Chosen by the white man, you hit store rappers
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back
Never knew a nigga that was better
Revenue, I'm good at gettin' cheddar
Reminisce on days I didn't eat
If it's meant to be, then it'll be
If it's not, then fuck it, I'ma try
Ain't no need to ask the Father why, no
‘Cause one day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, oh
One day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, my nigga, my nigga
Uh-uh, uh-uh
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, yeah
Uh
Baby girl, I can't imagine what it's like for you
I got you pregnant, now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin' if this is gon' make me think 'bout wifin' you
Like, if you have my first child
Would I spend my whole life with you?
Now, I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I'm tryna talk
Now, I ain't tryna spend the night with you, I'm kinda lost
See, I've been givin' it some thought lately
And frankly I feel like we ain't ready and this—
Hold up now, let me finish!
Think about it, baby, me and you, we still kids ourself
How we gonna raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself? A nigga barely over twenty
Where the hell we gon' live? Where am I gon' get that money?
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I ain't got shit to give 'em, and I'm not with them niggas
Who be knockin' girls up and skate out
So, girl, you gotta think about how the options weigh out
What's the way out?
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it
She said: "Nigga, you got some nerve
To come up to me talkin' about abortion
This my body, nigga, so don't think you finna force shit!
See, I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flippin' like reciprocals
It figures though, I should've known
That you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claimin' that they love you just to get up in them drawers
Knowin' all the right things to say
I let you hit it raw, mothafucka!
Now I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, mothafucka?
Tryna take away a life—is you God, mothafucka?!
I don't think so! This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife, this new life here, I'ma love it
I ain't budgin', I just do this by my mothafuckin' self
See, my mama raised me without no mothafuckin' help
From a man, but I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin' about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
‘Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doin' the same shit… You ain't shit, nigga!"
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it work, but you doubt it
They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons, then grow apart
She wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
She'd put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her ‘cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though
Uh-oh! She tellin' him she missed her period, like typos
He panickin', froze up like a mannequin, a life grows
Inside her, and now he askin': "Is it even mine?"
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant? Dog, could she be lyin'?
And she be cryin', ‘cause he actin' distant
Like, "Ever since I told you this, nigga, you actin' different."
And all his niggas sayin', "Man, these hoes be trappin' niggas
Playin' with niggas' emotions like they some action figures."
Swear they get pregnant for collateral, it's like extortion
Man, if that bitch really pregnant, tell her to get a abortion (Uh)
But what about your seed, nigga? (Uh-uh)
But what about your seed, nigga?
Niggas be thinkin' I'm deep, intelligent, fooled by my college degree
My IQ is average, there's a young lady out there, she way smarter than me
I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and I started to read
She mad at these crackers, she mad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me
Now I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism
So when I see something that's valid, I listen
But shit, it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em
And the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see
Just 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead, when you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveyin' you holier, come help us get up to speed
Shit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees, can't grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?
I'm on some "Fuck a retweet," most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon' reach?
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable, but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore, we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like, "Wait"
He was like, "Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real"
But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff?
Well, maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doin' enough
The sun is shinin' today
Can you walk with me?
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on, cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryin' to let the time heal my mind
I was once a child, I've gotten older
Still, I know I'm just a boy in God's eyes
Fill me up with wisdom and some courage
Plus endurance to survive, help mine thrive
Fell in love through photograph
I don't even know your name
Wonder if you'd follow back
I hope to see you one day
I won't show my niggas now
I'II keep this one for myself
Love today's gone digital
And it's messing with my health
Damn, I love your sense of humor
You don't get caught up in rumors
You don't be talking 'bout who fuckin' who
And I notice the way you maneuver
Sexy, but never show too much
Ain't heard from you in like two months
All of a sudden, you pop on my line
You could make time, stop on a dime
I think you mastered the art of sublime
Your type is harder to find
You could turn water to wine, yeah
You could turn water to wine, feel me
Niggas be talkin' so slick (ugh)
I'm not the nigga for lip (yeah)
Puttin' my heart in a click (yeah)
Can't see my heart, it don't fit (yeah)
Don't think I'm built for this shit (yeah)
Too busy thinking what if (yeah)
I shoot my shot and it brick (yeah)
Niggas be talkin' so slick (yeah)
Can't see my heart it don't fit (yeah)
I shoot my shot and it brick (mmm)
Fell in love through a photograph
Feel like I gotta say somethin'
Thought of you got my heart jumpin'
But I can't come up with nothin' (no)
But I can't come up with nothin'
I put it off for a day
I come back around your way
Searching for what I could say
That accurately could convey
The way that I feel in the word
That's different than what you done heard
So many done hit you wit game
So many been sent to the curb
And I did not come here to play
And I did not come to observe
But I did not come to observe
Feel me
Gimme my space, Lord, ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, nah mean? I got no time to wait
Love my girl, but I told her straight up, "Don't wait up"
Stumble home late, I'm drunk, we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feelin' like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wan' be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowin' when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wan' let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out, learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying, "Baby, won't you throw them bands on me?"
And I came to spend
She pop a molly, let the motherfuckin' games begin
I'm running away
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: "Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit?"
She losin' faith in him and he knows the shit, like, "What the fuck is a break?
Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got 'til it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't know if I can wait no more"
And who can blame her, you complain about
Every time you out, you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is whack, we 'bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evenin'
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you
Unbelievable, seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis, my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, "Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is"
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, 'cause you
Know your wifey loves you, thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains concealed
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?
You know
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
J.I.D, whoa shit, whoa shit, whoa shit
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
Please, please
Get off my dick, get off my dick
.40 my hip, loadin' my clip
Cannabis, cannabis, roll up my spliff
Hannibal, Hannibal, look what I did
Edible, edible, got the munchies
But I got the bungees, I'ma jump off this ship
But I bet he get whipped with the pistol grip
Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit
Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit (Whoa)
Okay, East Atlanta playboy
Don't got much to say, boy
Cradle to the grave, and it's been like that since a slave, boy
It ain't shit to pull up, pick the fucking tool up
Screaming hallelujah, pushing daisies and some tulips
(Hi guys, hi, hi, hi)
Itty bitty bitch, niggas in the city with it, pull up with a stick
Thirty with the dick
Seen you in a minute, nigga, put you in cement
Anybody get a nigga, anybody get
Shot to the top, nigga poppin' this shit
Got the drop in your crib, in the spot where you live
If you talking that shit, nigga, stop it
I'm a god, I'm a king, I'm a giant
Nigga not trying, .40 my side
Eastside guy, but I been worldwide
D.I.Y, T.I.Y, I'ma try, I'ma die for what I believe in
We like to feast and I try to eat, cannibal meat
I am not an animal, a beast
Riding with the hammer on the seat (Oh)
Shotgun, shotgun, hand on my heat
Bad man, bad man, land of my freedom
Nigga get life, let the white folks be
Online beef, not my motif
.45 me, ta-ta, go sleep
Don't mind little old me, lil' OG
J.I.D, I came in on the boat, see
May I be the cold nigga with the most heat
Niggas know bro, you don't know me
But I got the bungees, I'ma jump off this ship (Hey)
But I bet he get whipped with the pistol grip (Okay, okay)
Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit (Okay, okay, okay)
Legend out the 2-6 (Whoa)
Y'all know who the truth is (Whoa)
Crazy like a movie by that nigga Stanley Kubrick (Whoa)
Perfect time to pop up (Whoa)
Wet you like the hot tub (Whoa)
Clean up Aisle 7, damn somebody gettin' mopped up (Whoa)
Pull up on the block, eeny, meeny, miny, moe
You and every nigga that you know is getting popped
Fuckin' with a nigga, ass sitting in the box
Tryna sneak diss, then I'm pickin' up the Glock
I squeeze this, they be pickin' up the top
Styles, Sheek, Kiss, yeah, I'm pickin' all the locks
Pickin' on a nigga way bigger, then I got
Bigger than the nigga that was Kindergarten Cop
Terminator shit, I'm a robot
With the chrome .45 that most don't got
One false move, get your moto shot
Turn a nigga whip to a photo op
Click, click, click, and the flows don't stop
'Til I got more cream than Cold Stone got
Like a boatload, nigga I'ma float on top
'Til the grass don't grow and the wind don't blow
And the po-po don't kill niggas no more
I bought a thirty round extendo
If a nigga wanna duck, then I'm playing Duck Hunt
In real life, not on Nintendo
Looking out the window like Malcolm X with the rifle
Climb the steps up the Eiffel
Barely broke a bead of sweat, whoa
Many hope to be the best, oh
Cannot fuck with me just yet, though
J.I.D the closest thing to me
C'est la vie, my vocal range putting
Blood stains on Notre Dame hoodies
Hello fiends, I brought novocaine plus dopamine
You can load your veins with the product I slang
Niggas gon' honor my name, boy, I'm a god in this game
Y'all niggas homonyms, sounding the same
Not in my lane so I can't complain
Me and Ben Frank got a damn good thing goin' on
Way more than a random fling
Cole and J.I.D with a tandem, niggas can't stand 'em
Got a new anthem, look at my whip
Slit on my wrist, suicide, suicide doors on my Phantom
Get off my dick (Yeah)
Get off my dick (Whoa)
Get off my dick (Uh)
Get off my dick (Get off my)
Okay
Sucka!Something special, J.I.D, Cole, Drama
Dreamville
You can't be everything to everybody
I wanna be your lover, your best friend
Your Batman, Spider-Man
Fighter pilot shooting down your rivals and
I wanna damn near kill you to be the one that heal you up
I wanna be the one that feel you up
On nights when you need good dick to cheer you up
I wanna be the one to build you up
A wall worth five billion bucks to keep out the rah-rah
And the blah-blah-blah so nobody try to steal your thunder
Pull you under
Toss my hopes out, Royal Rumble
We done moved out to the boondocks
Built a big house, there he wonders
How somewhere along the way
He went from Huey to Eddie Wuncler
I been so disconnected, my perspective is ignorant
When you rich, niggas don't wanna correct you
Say something crazy, they won't interject
Do every drug that you want, they gon' let you
Dangerous when it's nobody to check you
I be havin' to check myself
Nigga, stop holding that money, you know you got plenty
I be havin' to spread my wealth
I used to be at the crib myself
7 years old, off of Bragg Boulevard
Where they bag up the raw
They gon' stand on the corner, one hand on they balls
And they ran when the cops come, there go the laws
Then I packed up a bag and I trapped it up north on the path of a star
And I ran into you like I met you before
Now damn, me and you goin' half on a boy, sing
Huggin' the block, huggin' the block all day
I had nowhere to go, she gave me a place to stay
She gave me her heart to hold, I still got that shit to this day
She ridin' with me on the road, she ridin' with me in the A
Huggin' the block, huggin' the block, okay
She gave me the gift of my son, and plus we got one on the way
She gave me a family to love, for that, I can never repay
I'm crying while writing these words, the tears, they feel good on my face, hey
And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah
If I don't love you how I'm supposed to
Cole World, Southside
Can’t get enough, can’t get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out
Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she’s fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
‘Cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name
‘Cause I really can’t take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit
Your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy.”
But I’m signed to the Roc
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter
Even way out in London town
Hoes holla, ’cause they love my sound
And I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that’ll cut all night
That’ll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight
On the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain’t nothin' sunny
I see ‘em hating, but it ain’t nothin' to me
I’m from the Ville, where they bang for the money
And carry fo’-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred?
Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr
That’s the hook right thurr! That's the hook right thurr!
Yeah, uh-huh
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Lord, know some hoes from the past
Like, "Damn Cole, wish I knew that you would be rich"
Well, shoulda asked
It's funny how these niggas on some real "be cool with me" shit
I bag two bitches like it's two of me, bitch
Finally got my own bedroom in this bitch
No more sleeping in my brother room
Like, "Man, I might as well be sleeping in my mother room"
'Cause how I'm supposed to sneak hoes with my bro here?
Plus she gon' find out I been rocking all his old gear
This his flow here, this is no fair, this is so pure
This is so clear, this is one breath, this is no air
Ain't no wedding but I do the most here
I'm the President, you the co-chair
You the player, yeah, I'm the coach here, nigga, I coast here
This weather got me set up on this West Coast, yeah
Avoiding the snakes, AKs, and coke, yeah
Get my dick wet but I never let it soak there
Man, I been thinkin' 'bout movin' out
What? Country boy in the city
Of New York nine years, ran that shit like Diddy
Riding through South Side Queens like Fiddy
Nothing's impossible
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight
She told me, "Watch the snakes 'cause they watching you"
I told her, "Awww baby don't start!
I ain't looking for the way to your heart!"
She said, "You 'bout to miss church" while she riding me
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop)
Hey make that ass drop (drop, drop, drop)
Now if you only had one wish is it devious?
'Cause you already know who your genie is
Ain't get a cover now your mag on my penis
Like damn, he turned out to be a genius
Damn, real shit nigga, no Pixar
You niggas soft like Meagan Good's lips are
My kicks hard, my whip hard
I came out the womb with my dick hard
Back when I was playing Stomp the Yard
It'd be a bunch of niggas up on campus talking hard
Don't get exposed to these hoes boy, knock it off
I seen your mama in the Benz when she dropped you off
Damn, now who more thorough than me?
I paint a picture of my pain for the world to see
Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see
Gotta ask myself, "What mean the world to me?"
Me, me
I told her, "Aw baby don't start!
She said, "You bout to miss church" while she riding me
Make that ass drop
Hey make that ass drop
Make, hey, make that ass drop (drop)
Hey, you seen me in this every damn day (drop)
It got the dick hard as a rock (drop)
And I can't control (Let it rock)
Hehe, control
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street wit'
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's when I ran into this chick I went to college with
Yeah, back when a nigga was on scholarship
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla, shit
That's the least I owed her 'cause see I tried to hit
On the first night, and nah, I ain't proud of it
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it
And I never called back, how thoughtfulless
Now I'm standing in the streets tryna politic with her
In her mind she calling me a misogynist, nigga
On some Bobby Brown shit, my prerogative, nigga
Is to hit and never commit
Not realizing when I hit she never forgets
So every time I ignore the telephone call
Saying I'll hit her back knowing I'm never gon' call, she was hurting
Now she's staring dead in my face, she was smirking
Like, "Yeah, I remember and nah you ain't worth shit, nigga
You ain't worth shit, nigga"
Hm, this the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
Dreamville head honcho
Bitch, we came from nothin' just like the big bang theory
The poverty stains kept the pain buried
And covered the shame with a dream
We would have fortune and fame
A mil' in the bank, chameleon paint turned cranberry
Now little Jermaine got the same story
As that boy out of St. Vincent-St. Mary, G.O.A.T.
All hail King Cole, first of his name, long may he reign
The boy got the throne, but you know it ain't a game
Ville nigga, I was born in the same
Pressure cooker that's been known to bust a lump of coal and make a diamond
Two six, we enrolled in Reaganomics
Crew sick, we the Golden State of rhyming, on God
Baby you deserve the whole enchilada
Gucci and Prada
Toast to the days when I didn't have a dollar
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me
Kicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me
Down for me, my homie
You better believe, I know your home girl said you should leave a note
Know you was tired like the Michelin man
What if Gina would have listened to Pam?
Now they hate to see us last this long
When they get my album, probably pass this song
Thought they knew me well
Money can't buy you happiness that's true as hell
But happiness can't buy yo' ass this new SL
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit
I love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit
Ride or die chick, fighting insecurities
Want a ring and my last name for securities
I know my style ain't perfect
I know my smile ain't perfect
Nigga ain't perfect, it's true
Funny though I am perfect for you
All the drama seem worth it for you
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true
Now what you crying for?
She says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?
She want that old thing back
Things ain't the same, think we both seen that
Love is war, end up on the floor
But baby you only lose when you don't swing back
I say those words hoping that
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you
Like I fight temptations every night for you
And know I slip, only girl in my life is you
Cop another bag and smoke today
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long
I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate
Cop another bag of smoke today
Ten toes to the ground
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening
No Promethazine I’m a king, no leaning
I got a better way to fight these demons
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain? blaow
I got a better way to fight them demons
Fuck do you know ‘bout my pain?
If I quote it nigga, I wrote it nigga
Six head shots, I’ll erode a nigga
Pop another clip and I'm reloaded nigga
Ain’t no way around it, I’m the coldest nigga
Do a nigga dirty life's a coal, my nigga
Get you cleaned up then I fold you nigga
Shout out to the haters who promote a nigga
Flow hot, whip cold, I’m bipolar nigga
But I don’t like to talk about a Rover nigga
Keep this shit a hundred, I just sold it nigga
Tired of police looking at me like I stole it nigga
Probably just gonna cop a lil Corolla nigga
Don’t need a rollie on to know I’m getting older nigga
Dreamville going way up like a floater nigga
Couple hands out like I owe them niggas
Where was you when the Civic was getting towed my nigga?
No snakes in the grass cause I mowed it nigga
(Right there let me get that there
Talk about it)
Fuck do you know ‘bout my dreams?
(Talk about it)
Nada
(If you really believe it, gotta talk about it
You heard about what happens when you talk about it
Niggas lookin’ at you funny when they start to doubt it
Fucking up your energy when you start to doubt it too)
Rollercoaster ride
(Start to doubt it too)
How much do it cost?
(Start to doubt it)
If I take a ride, fuck around get lost
(Shoutout my nigga Ib)
Rollercoaster ride, how much do it cost?
(El Presidente and shit)
(He want me to talk my shit for y'all)
Cole world you should stay off this dick
I sold out the Garden, I should play for the Knicks
Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
A nigga getting cream like an old ass Laker
But I ain’t coming to talk about all that paper
That’s what they talk about when they ain’t got shit to say
Can’t understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know the saying, same shit nigga, different day
I never felt that, no way
Cause on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish and chips
Why I do a lot of shows? I’m the shit, that’s it
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
Never stingy with the hoes word to Cliff and Chris
So if I fuck six bitches I got six assists nigga
The flow sick as shit, catch ebola if you bit this shit
I never take, I invent the shit then flip the shit
Then lick the shit, and bit the shit back twice, I’m that nice, woo
What’s the plan?
Cole keeps snapping like a Mustard jam
Got a middle finger for Uncle Sam
I done paid so much taxes I can fund Japan
But instead they make a young nigga fund the man
Same man that keep a young nigga under, damn
I just cocked back nigga and my gun don’t jam
On a scale from one to ten I’m a hundred grand
It's Cole fuckin’ world nigga
Dreamville in this motherfucker, Top Dawg in this motherfucker
"When you and K. Dot shit drop?"
Bitch never, they can’t handle two Black niggas this clever
But this February, bet shit get scary when I fuck around and drop...
(Censor Tone)
Yeah, I don't wanna put no pressure on ya
I just wanna put a blessing on ya
Since our last undressin' session
I'm not really sure if you've been checkin'
I'm progressin', I just heard my songs is poppin' out in Macedonia
And even Serbia, I don't mean to burden ya
If you got a man since then, I understand
Last thing I wanna do is get you jammed
'Specially if he's a fan, he'll prolly never wanna hear my shit again
And, I need every single SoundScan
But if you single and you down, then
I'm in your town fiendin' for another round
I was countin' down the days
Been more patient than a Browns fan
Where that chip at?
Prolly on your shoulder 'cause I forgot to hit back
Left you on read, apologies are said
But often never meant, well fuck that, I repent
For message never sent, now...
In case my lack of reply had you catchin' them feelings
Know you've been on my mind like Kaepernick kneelin'
Or police killings, or Trump sayin' slick shit
Manipulatin' poor white folks because they ignant
Blind to the struggles of the ones that got the pigment
Lately I've been stressin' 'cause it seems so malignant
I need to feel your essence in my presence if you're with it
I guarantee you won't regret you did it if you come through
(Ahh) Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone, show me it was real
Pick up the phone, yeah
(Mmm, say it, ahh)
Yeah, I got some niggas that still owe me an apology
I'ma be the bigger man just like I always be
Eventually but right now that's hard for me
I'm dreaming violent, I can't tolerate disloyalty
So I'ma see you when I see you, know that day comin'
I pray that on that day you slip and say something
I never fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm still sane
But I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me
I know the punishment for you is that you not with me
You place your value on the bitches that you got with me
And now the bitches ask you daily "Why you not with me?"
I had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me
My heart is big, I want to give too much and usually
I send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now
You hit my phone, you need a loan, oh I'm a crutch now
I had to learn, I never had shit
You never would split, you was hood rich
I couldn't get a dollar from you I remember that
It was blurry for a while but now it's coming back (coming back)
(I said) Set it off on my left, set it off on my right
(I said) Liquor all on my breath, bitches all in my sight
(I said) Real niggas tryna fuck, fuck niggas wanna fight
(I said) Gun shots into the air, but I ain't scared for my life
(I said)
Troubles of this, troubles of this world
Yeah, god flow
Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
Niggas say "Live fast, die young," so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it
Ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first is sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard "Can't Get Enough"
Now she fuck a nigga thinking that she may have hit the lotto
No way, Jose
Could write a book called, "The Things Hoes Say"
Show a lot of love to my sisters though
But these bitches so predictable
Getting to the promised land
You don't want problems, I promise, man
I take it to the promised land
Set it off on my left, set it off on my right
And I'm going back to school
Only for the hoes and a class or two
Young bad bitch made the pastor drool
Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like "Don't you know this shit already?"
"Nigga, ain't you rich already?"
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers 'cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jump shot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type
No saving hoes
I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And they mans don't know, they mans don't know, fo' sho
Had a nigga baby, little mans don’t know
Mama, was a freak, got it in on the low
12 years later when my song come on, he ask
"Mama, did you fuck J. Cole?"
Whoa
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time
For you I drop the tough guy shit, on this bus I sit
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Damn it feel good to have you
Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special
To somebody in a world where they not lovin' me
Handcuffs keep huggin' the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin' because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin' on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell? Where's your diaper shit here?
Lay on your back, don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking...
Am I worthy of this gift?
Am I strong enough to lift? (Am I strong enough to lift?)
Into a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me? (Someone more important than me?)
Am I worthy of this gift? (Am I worthy of this gift?)
Am I strong enough to lift (Am I strong enough to lift)
Ib gon' ask me how I did this shit
I'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
Thats the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit, hey mama look what God made
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me
I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die, 'cause now you're here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin', baby
I dry your eyes, I dry your eyes
There is a God, it is a God
Yeah, it is a God
(I never felt so alive)
You really wanna know who Superman is?
Watch this, pow!
I like him
I think he's pretty cool
He's my idol
I can't have no sympathy for fuck niggas
All this shit I've seen done made my blood thicker
Spill promethazine inside a double cup
Double up my cream, now that's a Double Stuff, yeah
Please don't hit my phone if it ain't 'bout no commas
Keep the peace like Dalai Lama, big body Hummers
Backin' out the parkin' spot and though the law be on him
He exempt, Shawn Kemp, he keep that .40 on him
Go!
Motivate (motivate), motivate (motivate)
Motivate (motivate), motivate (mo-)
Motivate (motivate), moti-get money
Too many times I swallowed my pride
(Get money)
I'm crackin' a smile, I'm dyin' inside
My demons are close, I'm tryin' to hide
I'm poppin' a pill, I'm feelin' alive
I'm feelin' alive, I'm feelin' alive
I'm
Woah, suddenly, I feel like takin' a PJ
Fly to D.R. on a weekday, eatin' ceviche
With like half of a mili' inside of my briefcase
A couple of freaks play
And they don't speak inglés
But the money is somethin' that they could comprende
And I got bread like I'm Green Day
I come around and their heads turn
Used to like bitches with hair permed
Now I like it "natural, actual, factual"
Naps and shit, bougie, still do ratchet shit
Not afraid to pass the clip
Before I make the ratchet spit, blaow!
Get money
I see the, I see the—
I see the rain
Pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain
Pouring down, uh
I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, huh
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord
The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Bells gettin' louder, louder
Hello, hello, hello
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes two now
Oh what do I do now?
Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing cause I
I ain't even got my own
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever
Hello, hello?
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Everything's so sad when you look back
On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick, don't it
Reflection bring regrets don't it
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good
One night
When me and my mom was about to go to bed
All the doors was locked
Then when I had fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, his name was Rod
The one that came to pick me up
He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach
I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell
All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame?
My occupation's on my brain
Thought that I could change it all if I had change
But the niggas that I came up with way back is still the same
I be tryna give 'em game like Santa did when Christmas came
They be listenin' but it's clear to me they did not hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin' point-blank range
Niggas bang in the Ville, I always thought that shit was strange
How you claim blood or cuz when that was just a LA thing?
I don't mean no disrespect towards your set, no, I'm just sayin'
That it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
Niggas will rep any gang, niggas will bust any head
Niggas will risk everything, point him out and then he dead
Shootin' up where his granny live, "blaow, blaow!", his granny duck
He don't give a fuck, he's on Henny and Xanny'd up
Blowin' Tammy up, bitch, when you gon' give them panties up?
He gon' plant a seed, but best believe he ain't man enough
Just because yo' dick can spray semen, it don't mean that you ready to let go of yo' childish ways
The results are deadly
Because that child will suffer and that's what can most affect me
The little girl I met this past summer said, "Don't forget me"
I won't forget you, how could I with all you went through?
A bullet hit yo' cousin in Temple while he was with you
And while you was talkin', I was tearin' up, where's the tissue?
If you was my sister then I would kiss you and tell you that I'm sorry for the pain you had to live through
I know I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than anything I done been through
It's not that big
Well at least, um
God had saved him 'cause he still alive
So why do y'all think that bad stuff happen?
Like why can't the world just be all nice things?
Because God is tryna, um
Warn-warn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
Or He's tryna warn us of He's comin' back to, um, see us and take us home and redo the world
He's comin' back to, um, have us be His children and for us to see Him for the first time so we can rejoice with Him and have our time
And after we do that, He's gonna restart the world
K.O.D
Choose wisely!
Are you doin' this work to facilitate growth or to become famous?
Which is more important?
Getting or letting go?
You can do anything, anything you can do (You can do anything)
You can do anything, anything you can do (You can do anything)
Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful?
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon (Bitch, I'm back out...)
To the left of that decimal, I need seven figures to play the joint
Turn up your decibels, peep how I decimate a joint
Check out my projects like them workers that Section 8 appoints
And you'll see how I flipped like exclamation points
My niggas shoot first as if they never played the point, more two guards
Enough straps to fill four U-Hauls
More death than World War II caused
Around these parts we pour the brown just to drown these thoughts
Of black corpses in county morgues, Lord, those images hauntin'
I ain't been asleep yet, it's ten in the mornin'
I'm sendin' a warnin', a problem with me is like the BET Hip-Hop Awards
I'm startin' to see you niggas don't want it
I'm sick of this flauntin', from niggas I know for sure ain't got mo' dough than Cole
Trash rappers, ass backwards, tryna go toe-to-toe
We laugh at ya, staff strapped up on top the totem pole to blast at ya
Bassmasters, look how they tote a pole
Gotta know the ropes and the protocol
Or they gon' for sure blow your clothes half off like a promo code
Made a lil' tune called "Foldin Clothes," and a nigga still ain't known to fold under pressure
Well, you know what Cole do
Make a diamond, they just rhymin', me, I'm quotin' gold
One phone call get you canceled like a homophobe in this PC culture
Address me as the G.O.A.T. like they call Chief Keef Sosa
In my sectional like a fuckin' three-piece sofa
I'm known as the chosen one
Another dead body lay frozen, that's how it go sometimes
When niggas weighin' coke and not the pros and cons
Well, I ain't with that sleepin' underground like a gopher, so I go for mines
Everything come back around full circle (Nigga, gotta go for mines)
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful? (Yeah)
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Now I know why they call it blue moon (Yeah)
Survival at all costs, every day, niggas get logged off
Bodies get hauled off
Passin' a funeral procession while holdin' my breath in the car, I thought
At times, it be feelin' the devil be winnin' but do that mean God lost?
Just got off the phone with my nigga, he back in the kennel, my dog lost
I brought him 'round close to me before but he
Became addicted to clout and all the hoes we'd meet
I slowly peeped jealousy on his breath whenever he spoke to me
Like on the low, he feelin' that in my shoes is where he supposed to be
I tried to ignore the signs, but they're in the back of my mind
It felt like lettin' a nigga come sleep on your couch and he eatin' up all yo' groceries
My nigga repeated this quote to me, I felt its potency
Said, "Most of these niggas gon' hang themselves, just give 'em the rope and see"
Shit, I heeded that, and what got showed to me
Was screamin' that, some niggas, you gotta leave 'em back
Unfortunately we seen the trap
Niggas be on that demon clock resultantly
They fiend to clap as often as the Genius app misquotin' me, uh
Meanwhile, I see that yo' diamonds is glistenin'
I'm glad that you shinin', but need I remind you my niggas is dimin' and nickelin'?
Scrapin' up whatever coin they can find, the pettiest crime, they committin' it
Just to get by for a limited time, the steepest of mountains, they tryin' to climb
I'm here tryna find the derivative, you niggas don't feel me
You see the clout, you don't see the real me
If I was sick, you niggas wouldn't heal me
Therefore I'm healin' myself, gettin' in tune with my God
Slowly revealin' myself, buildin' my wealth
A nigga touch mine, I'ma kill 'em myself, trust me
Everything come back around full circle
Bitch, I'm back outside, nigga
I'm back outside
Bitch, I'm back outside
Everybody mentions suicide prevention
Man, they even made a hotline
To call up when there's tension, but I got a question
What about a fuckin' homicide?
Need a number for my niggas to call
Whenever there's a urge to get triggers involved
Niggas hating on me, I ain't used to that
Know a couple people wanna shoot for that
I say "No, no, no, chill, it ain't no need for that"
Them niggas tryna blow and ain't need me for that
And if it work for them, well shit, I'm cool with that
'Cause how they feel, I ain't got shit to do with that
I just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
And trip off how much bread them crackers take from that
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's been a long time since I have felt this way
About something but now, but now
I'm controlling my mind, the days are warm
The nights are cold, the lost is found, I'm found
Lord knows I need something to fill this void
Hell yeah boy, I'm a goddamn millionaire now
Hell yeah, nigga, they can't tell me shit now, bro, hell no, fuck that
Bitch, got my first motherfuckin' million dollar check nigga
I'm goddamn lit boy, you crazy as hell
Hold up, it's my phone real quick, it's my Unc'
Uncle Sam and shit
"What's up Unc'? Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!
Yeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense
Where do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced
I guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
But my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools
Maybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send
Get spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them
And the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend
Got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
One thing about the men that's controlling the pen
That write history, they always seem to white-out they sins
Maybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again
I'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim
Damn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?
Some older nigga told me to start votin'
I said "Democracy is too fuckin' slow"
If I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know
Better yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018
Let me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen
Better that than letting wack congressman I've never seen
Dictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes
Stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
From the concrete, he was prolly rose
Now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
He did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
Who was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers
So right now, he got two on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
She can't take this shit no more, she want him out
On the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out
Wiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses
She remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn
Yeah, I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights, please
Lights please, lights please, turn off the lights
For now, everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
I'm feeling like things gon' be alright
So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryna put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like, "Baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen"
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow
The more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules, but yet y'all tryna play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make?
Coward nigga, you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family?
Dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recordin' tracks
Said "I know you wanna change the world
But for the night, please
Just reach over and hit the lights please"
Lights please, ah-ah-ah
Lights please, turn off the lights
Lights, please
Alright, if y'all niggas heard the first one, The Come Up and shit, then you would have heard part 1 of this joint right here. It's "Dead Presidents", you know classic nigga, that's classic Jay shit. So I did it, threw it on the first mixtape, this is about a year ago. We let niggas hear like you know the mixtape whatever, and there was always this one nigga that stuck out to me like a year ago. This nigga's like "yo". like I thought I did my thing on this shit, that was like two of my favorite verses that I did, but he was just like "Yo", like, "Yo you didn't come right man. If you gon' come on Dead Presidents son, you gotta come, hard son, you gotta come harder than that son, you gotta come harder than that." I was like, man what you mean I came hard? But, that shit always stuck in my mind, so doing this next, you know, doing this The Warm Up I was like, damn, I gotta get on it again, I gotta do it again. Just almost like, just to prove to that nigga and kinda prove to myself that you I can, I can maybe get a little...
Jodeci's back
You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga
(Fuck you mean you ain’t got no condoms)
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back (Cole)
Roof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be?
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Felt naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you ****** ** ******** ********
Hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for 12 hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?
'Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less than me
You legends know that we rap
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I put my heart and soul in this game, I'm feelin' drained
Unappreciated, unalleviated
Tired of comin' up short—fuck abbreviated
Want my whole name spelled out, my own pain spilled out
No pain, no gain, I blow brains—Cobain
Throw flames, Liu Kang, the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots
I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same
But homie if you change, may you change for the better
Back when Martin King had a thing for Coretta
Wonder if she seen all the dreams he was dreamin'
Did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin'
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin'
Months go by and only see him for a weekend
I say a prayer—hope my girl ain't leavin'
We all got angels, we all got demons
As you fall through the club
Bad bitches down to do all the above
Money comes fast so bein' hungry don't last
Till you look in the mirror and you saw who you was
Cole World—it couldn't be more clearer
The time is now—couldn't be more here-er
My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'ma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines
Up in 1st class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past 'im
Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'
Know what he askin', "how did he manage?"
"With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!"
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama
Laughin' at the grammar cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up in here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like "what the fuck you got a deal for?!"
When I was assed out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door
I made it to the rock, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don’t understand is this is all plan
It’s a bigger picture and you can’t photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I’m supposed to give a fuck
Don’t you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
And my lines is designed from the heart
Young Simba been a lion from the start
Dumb nigga’s, y’all been lyin from the start
My life’s like a movie, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you’ll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gone say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who’s to say that who’s greater, all we know, they ain’t the same
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now
Trials and tribulations I'm facing
In this age of information, I hate this shit
Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that he faces
My dad, he died—he got shot 'cause his friend set him up. And I didn't go to his funeral—and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me. And she—
And she say, "clean up"—I say—
Nigga play me, never, give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never, show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never
I get mad and I slam my door and go in my room—
And then, I get mad and I say, "I wish my dad was here"
Art of seduction, hoes jump like Vince Carter
Backstage like they a part of production
We talked about her dreams, you gotta start off with something
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustling
Found it funny 'cause now they daughter is stuck in
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went
She said "Your guess is good as mine
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time
Left me alone with this baby I don't hear from the nigga
And to keep hundred with you I don't care for the nigga
Well, movin' on
Funny 'cause I only know a couple of your songs but I love when they come on"
Word?
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you 'cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind, embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it, do not waste it
Take a shot, you not wasted
I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick, girl how could you not taste it?
That's a little ego—
Tistic, my amigos be hocking in Toledo
Niggas winning off me, it's all G 'cause he know
Bitches can't get the Michael so they settling for Tito
We know, yeah nigga we know
Hot bitch fell in my lap like cappuccino
Niggas so thirsty it irks me
You keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though
Nah nigga, the game is to get
A bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit
I swear if niggas put half of what they put in chasing ass
Into a craft, by now you'd be famous and rich, huh
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch
While you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick, huh
She thinking she got a first round pick, huh
She thinking 'bout all the things she can get, huh
She thinking you got a Range for a whip
And a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple 'cause
All you got is a phone full of bitches
And they just like her
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word
Wanna ride my nouns, let her suck my verbs
Aye
Hey, hey
I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you
Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you
Folding clothes
Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk
("You soft!")
If I can make life easier
The way you do mine
Save you some time
Alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax
Let you recline babe
Then I should do it
'Cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see
It's the simple things
That say "I love you"
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
"Damn, what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
It's only what you got in the form of the highest power you seek
Now this right here's not a preview
I need to let it go
Now this right here is not a preview
Of what the album goin' to bring you, or nuttin' like that
Sharing things I think quietly, with those that admire me
Remember MTV Diaries? This something like that
I wear my heart up on my sleeve, and I bleed for you
Cookin' beats hoping' to reach like each one you
When I release, trust if you feel like my shit is weak
When you see me on the street, then speak, I refund you
This sample was yellin' "loop me!"
Ms. Hill, please don't sue me
Cause I ain't one of these rappers out here frontin' like he got it, nigga
I ain't fuckin' got it, nigga...
Throwing thousands in the strip club with Drizzy
Difference is I'm throwing four, he's throwing 50, Lord, forgive me
Bitches saying: "You a rapper nigga, ain't you s'posed to tip more?"
I don't see no pussy, baby, ain't you s'posed to strip more?
Confessions of a cheap-ass nigga
But I finally put my Momma in that E class, nigga
And I told her quit her job, but hold your horses
If my next album flops it's back to the post office, both of us, shit
They're saying that's a real possibility
The thought alone is killing me
I think I need to let it go
I need to let it go, uh
Let it go, let it go
'Cause nothing even matters...
Anticipating rain, I can't make the same mistakes again
Them '90s niggas raped the game
And left us with a battered and bruised bitch, with a few kids
The pussy loose, but the truth is I love her, though
She ain't perfect, but who is?
Hoes saying "Cole, you is" don't be silly, ma, 'cause really I
Just a born sinner the opposite of a winner
Cole summer, I predict another winter
'Cause I'm fin' ta drop knowledge like a five percenter
Fuck the Bilderberg, nigga show 'em God sent ya
Rhyme with the skill, as if Nas went to
College on scholarship met Pac and said "I'm down witcha"
And when they wasn't writin' rhymes they fuckin' line sisters
Puffin' on swishers, what's up Milan?
Every time I drop I get the net poppin' like Lebron swishes
Kay told me kill ya, and I gotta respect my Mom's wishes
When I let go this how my mind switches
No looking back, don't even want to see my prom pictures
Pardon the rhyme scheme, I guess I'm long winded
Let me switch it now, back to Hell's kitchen now
Up in Hova office like he the fucking principal
Put me in with Stargate, that shit was like detention now
Just tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now
Drop a couple hits and all the dummies pay attention now
A shame when you learn the ins and outs of the game
And reminisce on little Jermaine in the south
Rappin' out loud, with all the niggas that's cool to you
Just to realize that all them niggas was foolin' you
And they ain't who they said they were
Talk about the streets, but nigga that ain't really where they were, actin' just like there they were
But who am I to judge? That's neither here or there
Just know I know, my nigga, I just like being aware
If I had one wish, I would fuck Tia and Tamera
At the same time and put name tags on they titties
So I don’t get they names wrong, screamin' "Game on"
Like Wayne's World, that just came on
I'm rambling now, five days to finish the album, I'm scramblin' now
Took a break from samplin' now
Just to say a few words to this bitch named Summer
June will make four years since I gave you my number
The Warm Up dropped, I got hot, you called it a classic
And Jay dropped "Autotune", you wanted him back, shit
Play my position, the whole while still wishin'
A year later Drake put his key in your ignition
And I told my fellas I dropped Friday Night Lights
In the winter just to make her jealous
Wanted to drop the album in the summer, but the label didn't think that they could sell it
Recoup the first week, I think it ain't shit they can tell us
Do you agree?
Been a long time coming this thing between you and me
I can't let it go
I can't let it go, nah
I think I need to let it go, let it go
Let it go
They say I need to let it go
'Cause nothing even matters, ayy
June 25th
Born Sinner, bitch
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter, it don't matter
I don't mind cause you don't matter
I don't mind cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter)
You'll see in the end
I've got a feeling that there's somethin' more
Something that holds us together
The strangest feeling but I can't be sure
Something that's old as forever
Yeah nigga, Forest Hills Drive. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. We made it, baby! As we speak the last sample just cleared. Thank you to whoever in Japan, just cleared that shit.

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man, we’ve been walking forever
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap
When it all just goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, acceptance
This is called being high as shit, for hours
That's the name of this song, nigga
"High as Shit for Hours"
Here we go, yeah
American hypocrisy, oh, let me count the ways
They came here seekin' freedom
Then they end up ownin' slaves
Justified it usin' Christianity which saves
Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way
That's why ISIS is a crisis
But in reality, this country do the same shit
Take a life and call it righteous
Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly?
In a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin'
These white ladies watchin' CNN, coverin' the action
They read the headline and then they all started clappin'
As if LeBron had just scored a basket at the buzzer
I stood there for a second
Watched them high-five each other
For real? I thought this was "Thou shalt not kill"
But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville
Claimin' that he reached for a gun
They really think we dumb and got a death wish
Now somebody's son is layin' breathless
When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas
Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus
Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas
Out there for the summer, feelin' just like I was Alice
Lost in the Wonderland where niggas still sufferin'
Just like they was back home, and that's wrong
So now it's "Fuck the government!"
They see my niggas strugglin'
And they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
I had a convo with the President, I paid to go and see him
Thinkin' about the things I said I'd say when I would see him
Feelin' nervous, sittin' in a room full of white folks
Thinkin' about the black man plight, think I might choke
Nope, raised my hand and asked a man a question
Does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression?
And if so, if you got all the power in the clout
As the President, what's keepin' you from helpin' niggas out?
Well, I didn't say "nigga," but you catch my drift
He looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift
He broke the issues down
And showed me he was well-aware
I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared
But dawg, you in the chair, what's the hold-up?
He said, "There's things that I wanna fix
But you know this shit, nigga: politics."
Don't stop fightin' and don't stop believin'
You can make the world better
For your kids, before you leave it
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back 'til they kill me
But fuck that, I'ma bust back until they kill me—feel me?
The type of shit that make you wanna (Aight, third verse)
Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart
Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart
See, the people at the top
They get to do just what they want
'Til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart
Then they start to holla "Revolution!"
Tired of livin' here, destitution
Fuck that lootin'! Can you tell me what's the best solution?
I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see
If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed
But see, it's not that simple
I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature
While this instrumental played
Then I realized somethin' that made
Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way
The children in abusive households grow up
Knockin' girlfriends out cold—that's called a cycle
Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go
So understand
You get the power, but you know what power does to man?
Corruption always leads us to the same shit again
So when you talk 'bout revolution
Dawg, I hear just what you sayin'
What good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you
I said, what good is takin' over
The only real revolution happens right inside of you, nigga
(High for hours, nigga)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go (Volume one)
Yeah, uh, yo
You gotta li—, you gotta follow me
With what I'm doin' right here, mane
Like, when I say this shit is crazy
I don't mean it's crazy like crazy
I just mean crazy like it's fuckin'—
Like it's actually crazy
Know what I mean? Yeah
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fuckin' with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated
With the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait and
Is fate procrastinatin'?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's…
This is the girl of my dreams
Yeah, and is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
Is she as good as what she seems?
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Aye, tell me, is it stalkin' if I follow her
Like, all the way home without her knowin'?
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides, when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she'll wave at me
Imagine what she'll say to me
This ain't no time to be afraid no more, it's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy
Aye, and is she good as what she seems?
Look, I spot her walkin' in the mall
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my God, I'm walkin' towards her
My mind's screamin' stop
But my legs keep walkin' forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you comin' for her!
My heartbeat racin', and my hands keep shakin'
Say somethin', you shy motherfucker, she's waitin'!
"What's up, girl? Don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women, but
You from my dreams
And will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch
Some R&B and rap, and you should come through."
She said, "Uh, I'd love too
Except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that." (Damn, Damn)
Okay, you say you got a man
I mean, I definitely understand
I'm happy for you, really am
I couldn't have been the only fan
In the world of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie
Well, I'm sure that I'm gon' see you 'round the city
Only thing I ask, if shit don't work out for y'all
Then don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene
I came up with a world-class scheme, to get…
The girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or should I try and get some help?
So I find out the nigga name
Know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work
"Hold up, nigga, is you sane?"
I'ma follow in my car; I'ma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall
Maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time
Then console her while she cryin'
She gon' take that as a sign
Finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen
When I hit her with the ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?
Think I should try and get some help
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Well, okay
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)
Everything is strange (Strange,) that's just a game (Game)
Everybody trippin' (Woo,) throwin’ it away (Yeah)
We was gettin' lifted, now we gettin' paid
Shame on you (Yeah)
A—a'ight, a'ight
I paid the cost to see apostrophes
That means it's mine (Yeah,) keep to myself, takin' my time (Uh-huh)
Always into some bullshit, and outta line
Drivin' with my eyes closed, missin' all the signs
Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sittin' pretty (Pretty)
Listenin' to Whitney and whippin' it through the city, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Man on a mission, figure it out
Puttin' way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down (Down, down)
I keep my head above the water (Water)
My eyes gettin' bigger, so the world is gettin' smaller (Smaller)
I be gettin' richer but that only made me crazy
Mama told me I was different even when I was a baby
That Mercedes through the P.A. when I pull up (Pull up), soundin' like a concert
Or a (or a) monster truck, I'm trippin' but I'm fallin' up
Always said I want it all, but it's not enough
Well, o-kay (Yeah)
And everything is strange (Strange,) that's just a game (Game)
We only just begun
No, we don't wanna hurt your feelings
'Cause it’s only just begun
No, we don't wanna
Hurt (Hurt) feelings (Feelings)
Down go the system, long live the king (King)
Turn the power off and get your water from the spring (Spring)
I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy (Yeah)
I give a hundred and fifty percent
This is the shit that I'm dealing with, but I wish I'd forget
Used to be feelin' depressed, now that I'm livin' I'm a little obsessed, yes
High in Jacuzzis, I be hittin' the jets
I'm showing her some love she been givin' me sex (Bless, bless)
Respect to Adonai
Don't fuck around and be a victim of your pride, why you lyin'?
(Why you lyin'?) Tell the truth, just step aside
I don't got the time to let it slide (Yep)
I'm too grounded, push whips that move mountains
New cribs, blue fountains, these are my surroundings
I've been going through it, you just go around it
But it's really not that different when you think about it
Hurt
Feelings
Praise to the almighty, HiiiPower
Me and my niggas (Live forever)
3 eyes to my alumni
Feel this
I wanna hear it, turn me up (My niggas on point, game tight)
Turn me up a little bit more nigga (My niggas on point, game tight)
My nigga Cole in this motherfucker. Wassup nigga?
(My niggas on point, game tight)
There we go yeah, turn me up
Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy
Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go
Block is hot, the streets is cold
Free to love, to each his own
Free from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time
To look behind and say, "Look where I came
Look how far I done came"
They say that dreams come true
And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing
Now do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be
This one's for you
I think I made it
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (This one's for you)
La, la, la, la, la (I'm hella faded)
La, la, la, la, la (Yeah)
I'm hella faded, yeah
I'm hella faded, I'm hella faded
These niggas been hating, I don't know the reason now
Sometimes I feel jaded
They don't see the real me
They only know Cole, they only know Co-ole
I had to get back, I had to resort to turning my back
I'm doing just that, true that
I thought he was through with me, but that wasn't true
The proof? You in the coupe with me
God shuffled the cards, dealt me a hand with impossible odds
Put an obstacle course up
Look, and I conquered them all (Conquered them all)
With minimal effort I'm fresher than sock in your drawer (Fuck)
They spinning my records so heavy, I'm topping the Forbes
Stuck in a rock and a hard place though
Is it true what they say? The higher you go, the longer the fall?
Well, I dropped to the floor, the knock at the door was on cue
Uh, I thought that I saw it all 'til I saw you
Now I call you when the sun shines and the rain dries up
I'm a pit bull, but for you I be on chain tied up (One more time)
In the backyard with a muzzle on tail wagging like Oregon Trail
Waiting on you to come through just like you do, well
I think I made it, I think I made it
'Cause I'm always smiling and you are the reason now
Blood thicker than water, right
Fuck bitches, they all alike
Stand up nigga, not the fallin' type
Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue, never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
'til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone, next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called "Control" was on
The room got nearer, the tune got clearer
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl, what is that, a ringtone?
Shit, not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what I'mma do
Decisions, decisions
In case this is war, then I load up on all ammunition
If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto
I'll make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me?
I don't need you, I got me, bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC, bitch
Got a record deal and a college degree, bitch
Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks
And I never ever ever lean on Jay-Z, bitch
And after all that achievement
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed
Now you try to play me, bitch?
You try to fuckin' play me? I ought to knock your ass out
Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go, maybe I'll stay (Maybe I'll stay)
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth, I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's 'bout to get paid
Ay from the door I showed you my scars
And I told you girl, "I won't lie"
If we at war, then this is a war that I can't afford, no I, I, I
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I–I cry (No I, I, I)
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
If you won't take me in your home
Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, "Mama, go to sleep"
She tell me "Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed"
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, "Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'
Out of fear I won't be free
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Right
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)
And I'm in denial
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile
I know, I be on the go
And there ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
Oh no
All we wanna do is take the chains off
All we wanna do is break the chains off
All we wanna do is be free
Can you tell me why
Every time I step outside I see my niggas die
I'm lettin' you know
That there ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
Are we all alone, fighting on our own
Please give me a chance, I don't wanna dance
Somethings got me down, I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around, don't just stand around
This is a public service announcement
Brought to you by the good people over at Dreamville Records
"And so my fellow Americans
Ask not what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country!"
Excuse me
Load the clip in the chopper, flip the script and get Oscars
All my niggas is mobsters, all my bitches is doctors
Cole World, this just the tip of the iceberg
So talk shit and taste the tip of the Mossberg
Don't trip nigga, they just words
Though my words tend to sound like Proverbs
Niggas don't see the preachers 'til we dead in the hearse
Granny broke cause she always givin' bread to the Church
Now pastor Mason Betha in a Lambo
And little niggas holdin' desert eagles like they Rambo
Bumpin' my shit, always wondered why they fuck with my shit
I hope it's 'bout the knowledge, not about who's suckin' my dick
But oh well, I'm gon' sell like I had no bail
For my chain and my piece I should've won Nobel
Ill, boy you cold nigga, yeah I know nigga
Only young nigga do it better than the old niggas

Took chances, slow dance with the devil bitch
Overcomin' the circumstances, we hella rich
Since you all in my business, this what I tell a bitch
If you ain't fuckin' me, don't fuck with me, this life on the edge
Green dollars splurged all on embellishments
My fellowship paid, don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the party, some Cinderella shit
Smash for the hell of it, livin' life on the edge
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' thousands out
Am I about dollars or about change?
Am I about knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain
Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense
That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'
Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets
Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit
Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit
I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit
In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit
Who the fuck was I?
Just a young little nigga tryin' to see the other side
Of the railroad tracks, where them scarecrows at
No brains on a nigga but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam I won't sell your crack
I won't fight your wars, I won't wear your hat
I'ma pass your classes, I'ma learn your craft
I'ma fuck your daughters, I'ma burn your flag
They don't feel my pain
They'll never feel my pain
And they'll never play this shit on the radio
Like we always do at this time, Cole blowin' your mind
Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was designed
T—t—t—took my time, c—c—crept from behind
And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine, Cole World
Same nigga used to drive around with yo girl
In my mama's Civic, now I'm out here tryna get it
I ain't like you lame ass niggas, boy I spit it how I live it
So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't gotta mimic
'Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit
I ain't got a gimmick, I just flow, the niggas went nuts for
The boy that set fire to the booth
In a game full of liars, it turns out that I'm the truth
Some say that rap's alive, it turns out that I'm the proof
'Cause the ones y'all thought would save the day can't even tie my boots
The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose
Let these words be my bullets, nigga, I don't rhyme, I shoot, bang!
Before I wake, uh
I pray to the Lord, uh, my soul to take, uh
My soul to take, uh, my soul take, uh
My soul to take
Lord I been dreamin' bout the paper, get rich 'fore I see my life taper
Hope my mama get to see Jamaica before she meet her maker
I hoop was never good enough to ever be a Laker
But these words I record got me ballin', Jordan
More than a rapper, this a natural disaster
Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina, "Shut up, Cole!"
This is for my niggas back home, homes, what up, bo?
This is for the bitches that played me, what up, ho?
Nah, I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad
Two kids that don't even know their real dad
Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic
Is Cole still at it? Y'all be talkin' about the same shit
That's how I feel about it, mama was a real addict
That's why I don't respect that lyin' ass white shit you talkin'
Cole's planning funerals, you might fit the coffin
My soul to take, hey
Get on your job lil mane, this ain't Saturday
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate
We in two different games, you playin' patty cake
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier
You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it
She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it
But it's just a nigga God invented
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it
But if this shit ain't fire nigga, why you noddin' with it?
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it
Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me
Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga
Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga
I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga
You saved so many hoes, you a hero, nigga!
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac
When he slept with Madonna, hey, this is death before dishonor
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama
She got enough to stress about, my niggas gonna get me out
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set
It goes tick-tock, game on lock
Son gon' shine but the reign won't stop, oh no
If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
My soul to take, my soul to take
Take it all the way from the beginning
Yea, yea, yea
Now comes the question of which intro do you use?
Do you use this intro or the other intro I was talkin' on?
But, then that lets people know I had more than one take
So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through
Yea, let's do that...
You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz, well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough
Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough
Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole, um world don't you forget that
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
But no sit-ups for me, long as my dick still get up for me
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Woah, that's TMI, lil' something like TMZ
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
Cause my girl do not play, coach DNP
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out
Ced on the beat let me vibe out
We was 15 with a ASR up in my house
Writin' rhymes out, momma made it happen
Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin'
He made it rappin', now at the shows he the main attraction
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?
(It's lit, feel the buzz?)
That's deep
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now I'm shining in the broad day light, go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the Ville
Got a deal, a real lifesaver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like Jada
I chill now, cop a little ice later
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him! Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
Flow so sick, thought he wrote the rap for him—no, sir!
The flow cold as the shoulders
Of gold-digging hoes when a broke nigga 'proaches
Told you I’m focused, man
I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in, and clap for 'em!
Ahem
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff, like Mrs. Huxtable
These boys got them hoslters and clips they pack like Lunchables
Like white boys in grade school, while we ate school-made food
Just eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store, she wasn’t buying that shit
No, I ain't crying a bit man, that's just life, that's how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt, even if it's with Cupid
He beat you and you went back, you's officially stupid
Oh yeah, I understand, that's your man, you had a plan
You been together for some years, you sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears, but we both know that's a bad look
'Cause 20 years from now, your daughter probably get her ass whooped
Look, if this too deep for the intro, I’ll find another use
But just in case it's, perfect let me introduce... Cole
Man, is this too deep for the intro? If so, I’ll find another use
But just in case it's perfect, let me introduce...
It’s Cole, I had a dream, and so I made a move
A ill-ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and mothertfuckers that hated school
Said, "That's for busters," then heard my shit, and I made it cool
It's safe to say that I’m gifted as if I’m Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
Ayy, possibly 'cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate
So you know a nigga late to my first class
I’d much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash?
Wasn't experienced, so nah, I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed 'bout
I used that ass for practice, so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes, I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy staring out my blinds
'Til I got free from my mama leash
Running loose through the streets, like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks, can you play, pardon me
What's your name? Don’t mistake me for no lame, no, not me
She knew I was on the team 'cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin’ niggas, even-tu-ally R-I-P
Damn, you win some, you lose some, that's just how it happens
And if a nigga step up to you, then you gotta scrap 'em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
Its funny, I barely told nobody I started rapping
'Cause see, some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At fourteen, I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don’t know your dreams, then they can't shoot 'em down
Ha
Yeah nigga
Hell yeah
I felt that one in my fuckin' soul, nigga
Haha
Now do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired?
Do I roll up, get higher?
Or po' up, get tired? Yeah
Okay, I'm back on a mission to pay my tuition
Got loans out the ass, what you know 'bout my past?
I was so late for class, hit the probate, get trashed
Fell asleep off the Henny, back in '08, I crashed
With my foot on the gas, thank the Lord I'm still here
No insurance, so now I'm racin' home on first gear
On that morn' I shed tears, asking what I'm doing here
I should be rich, I'm sick, it's like I got the fuckin' flu in here
But yet I'm just chillin' like I'm back on the yard
My niggas say I'm the truth and when I rap they applaud
That what was my Unsigned Hype like in the back of The Source
It's like I'm tryna get the head, but she just jackin' me off
I needed more
Had to earn stripes, no Adidas store
Put my feet on floor, borrow money from mi amor
Just to cop a microphone, the same one that put me on tour
She held you down, now you out here fuckin' 'round
Now this is for my broke niggas, rich niggas, what?
Gold diggers, Crys sippers, what?
Cold nigga, flow sicker, what?
Muh'fucker, I'm a fuckin' head bussa, go
Coming down on the strip, liqour in the whip
Parking lot pimp, enough game to be sold
Learn from me, fuck bitches, burn money
Someone told me boy you got your whole life to get old
But everything that glitter ain't gold
The grass ain't greener, I've been told
She told me, "Boy you want your cake and eat it too?"
I said "It's cake, that's what you're supposed to do?"
Ok my granny just died, but I'm too broke to go
And she asking my fears but she too close to know
Got trust issues I'm trying, where it come from? Don't know
I just block out the pain, blow the fuck up, get dough
See, I thought that would help me, it turns out it's worse now
My girl want her first child, my label won't work out
My mama don't see me unless I'm on TV, I pray she (dont break down)
She strong, but she need me
They killed Saddam, now I wonder who's sane
How you balance being Batman, Bruce Wayne?
Old chick callin', but I'm onto new things
She still a dime, but I always lose change
Young Simba, went from bottom of the food chain to a few chains in a new Range
She tellin' me "So much has happened, would've thought you changed!"
We ain't fuck in nine months its safe to say I'm due man
Someone told me "Boy, you got your whole life to get old."
Your every kiss, your every touch
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, uh
Sip from the bottle for shit that we bottlin' in
Goin' live, but we not on the 'Gram
This the land of supply and demand
Where my young niggas choppin' up grams
And them choppers won't pry from they hands
Packin' lead like they got a exam
If it's beef, my niggas look just like homewreckers
They got they eye on your mans
I pray to God that it jam
Too many done died in these parts
So we gotta be smart if we tryna see August
Some niggas won't make it past summer regardless
I'm tryin' my hardest to stack my deposits
These niggas be lookin' at me like I got it
Deep down inside, though, I still feel as broke
As that nigga who just graduated from college
Scrapin' up change that got left in my pockets
I'm tryna make nickels turn into a dollar
Ridin' the train, way too shy to go holler
Just watched her get off at her stop, I'm a coward
Fuck it, though, you got a way bigger target
I'ma do it so big, they won't know what to call it
Sound like a whole Lambo' truck in my stomach
Bitch, I ain't hungry, this feeling is starving
Gotta move mama from out them apartments
Gotta put 'Ville on the map, we forgotten
Gotta hit hoes you hang up in your locker
Gotta get rich, 'cause my granny picked cotton
Gotta make hits, 'cause if not, then I'm floppin'
Gotta stay me in the process
Niggas dissed me, it was nonsense
I sat 'em down like his father
My nigga asked, "Why you bother?
We should've caught him and mobbed him"
I said, "We gotta move smarter"
Don't wan' be the reason for one more sad song
I tried to warn niggas they wouldn't last long
I hope that you see how they came and they went
They shots never hit, but they made they attempts
May have a good year like that name on the blimp
But you know what it takes to be poppin' this long?
Dedication on another level niggas never seen in they life
Celebratin' all your first downs like they touchdowns bring a price
Young Simba had the bustdown, yeah, the Lion King on ice
Niggas wanted me to look the part, had to stop takin' advice
Put the jewelry to the side, had to find me, had to find God
Half the time, we be pacifyin', what they expect from us?
But that's treacherous, that shows less of us
I need y'all to see every part of me
Every scar and every artery
Every story that I can recall, then I can fall
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie (Uh)
Lately, I reflect on the times a nigga was low
I got it up off the floor, I'm stronger than ever before
I'm stronger than ever before just like I planned to be
They wanna see me fold, it ain't no thang to me
Thoughts when I was broke, if only I could be
Pockets holdin' hope, it ain't no thang to me
At night, I hit my knees, I prayed for better days
Then found a better me, I got my head on straight
Up, up, and away, just ridin' my wave, I ain't never gon' say nothin'
Nigga throw a shot my way, I just jot down names, ain't never gon' say nothin'
Know you be stressin', hate only block your blessin', I'm never gon' say nothin'
Quit all that flexin', niggas live check to check, I'm never gon' say nothin'
Know that it's destined
These niggas know
Huh
Armed and dangerous, call the law
Stick to the script, no audible
Country ass nigga with an Audemars
Can't spell the shit but I order more
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle
Get good head on the Autobahn
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God
Five steps like Dru Hill
Came home from the first tour, with
Bad credit and a school bill
Middle finger to the bursar
Finally famous but
Ain't too much really change with us
Straight up weed; no angel dust
Label us notorious, that was 9-7
Saw my old teacher and she asked how I'm livin'
You ain't know my shit drop bitch? 9-11
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game would do to you
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Better me than you
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggas know
These niggas know, boo-ya nigga?
Came through the door like who y'all niggas?
Stole a nigga flow, I could sue y'all niggas
Better yet put a hot one through y'all niggas
Nah, let me stop frontin' for y'all niggas but
Don't let the college shit fool y'all niggas
Ain't the hardest nigga in the land
But a grown ass man, and I will step to y'all niggas
Like what's the problem?
Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan
My shit long, need a hair salon
Get it cut, shut the fuck up
And wipe your face with my money 'til your tears is gone
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)
What the fuck was I s'posed do?
Deny that, rather try that, but I never fly that
Keep hoes bi-coastal
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free
Dick the only thing that they get from me
Sit VIP, get a sip for free
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally
Picture me at the tip-top
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch
Hate to brag but backpacker that's hip hop
Write my life and make sure that the script hot
And pray the kids watch, if not
If not, these niggas know
I must confess, I cut the chains
Ayy
Cole World
Forreal
Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just paintin' my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say: "I see you"
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch your chain, I bet it still won't free you
'Cause I be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
Swear I heard my jeweler say, "Here go your chain my nigga"
This is chaining day

Upgrade Before You Sell
I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Ohh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (My chaining day), love me
My last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (Love me, love me, hey hey)
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear (Love me, love me)
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Roley
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
Same shit a rich white motherfucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home a nigga sick today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', "Fake it 'til you make it"
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And acted like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated 'til hundred racks, I gave it up
For what
I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Ohh, my chaining day)
Lord, this is the last time (hehe)
Told my accountant, "It's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said that shit last time
But this the last time"
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
This the last time
'Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
'Cause I love this slavery
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I said this is my last time
Good girl at heart - I remember you well, I remember you well
Got a husband and kid, but I flirt, hope you do a little dirt
Cause I'm diggin' you still, that's real
But na you don't text back and deep down I respect that
Cause even though a nigga wanna tap that shit
I don't wanna be the one to wreck that shit
So, so I fall back, year go by I got more plaques
Just to get a call from you tellin' me you miss me
And you wanna see me next time the tour's back, damn
Well what changed then? She tellin' me a nigga had her caged in
Every time she think about me on the road
She be cryin' realizin' all the places that she ain't been
Well it's cool, I'll pick you up, hold you down, lift you up
These other niggas try and fuck
I'm the only one who cut and still came back to stitch you up
So we fuck, say what? You ain't been home lately
You ain't heard that nigga? Her man left cause she cheated on his ass
Found her pills in a bag, yo she burned that nigga
(She burned that nigga)
Say what? She burned that nigga (she burned that nigga)
Say what? She burned that nigga
Dawg, she burned that nigga
He beat her ass in the crib then he went and did a bid
All cause a bitch burned that nigga
Now dog, that's real ass shit
That's word around the ville ass shit
Did you strap up? Did you the strap up?
Please tell me that you strapped up nigga
We could kill that bitch if you want to
I'm cool, I strapped up, played by the rules, damn
While I'm sittin' here blessed, she at the crib all alone and she stressed
So nigga I
Yeah, hey, Cole world
Hey, I gotta dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So if it's 'bout that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream, just a dollar and a dream
Cole, walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind, I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
'Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowin' it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em'
They say he wouldn't leave me, yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress of this mess you in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin', now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king
Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy, just got a mean flow
Never seen rich but he's seen poor
Mr. Dollar and a Dream in case she know
That's all a nigga got
Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti
Ya paper, confetti, small time, ya'll on one, I'm on mine
You logged off 'cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares when niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies, who infiltrated my team
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
Ya never have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If ya don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, Mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
'Cause this life gets hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? my fans, and my mans
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' "Goddamn, what's her name?"
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like, "Bitch, don't be so fuckin' lame"
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those prayin' for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will
Mr. Dollar and a dream in case she ain't know
Hey, 'cause nigga that's life, and trust me I'm livin'
Look what a nigga made out the shit that I was given
Look what a nigga made out
Got a dollar and a dream
Three
Mo Money, yeah
Mo Money, Blow Money, Show Money
Party Money, Side Ho Money, Dope Money
New Clothes money from shit that I wrote money
So much money I don't know who stole from me
Hard to keep track I'm used to having no money
Still broke compared to niggas with old money
I mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money
Billionaires with petroleum and coal money
Probably kill they selves if they had Cole money
Talk shit and I'mma see you like you owe money
I'm wrapping up the album, fourth quarter I'm so money
I'm overseas looking for trees to grow money
Peter Pop off, robbing people for hope money
Prostitutes collecting that "let me stroke" money
Put up a couple dollars for the liquor store money
Used to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money
Now the strippers give a nigga the throat for no money
How mama gonna teach you how to save your money
When she barely on the boat, got stay afloat money
Blacks always broke cause we don't know money
Spend it 'fore we get it and could never hold money
No wallets, nah, nigga we'd rather fold money
Money control niggas, white man control money
Laughing like "yeah yeah my nigga get your money"
I'm on my night job, y'all niggas jivin', I'm back up in position
Earnhardt, I'ma catch some nigga slippin'
Burn hard on a track and get to whippin'
I'm on my night job, why is it always blacks that get detention?
For my nigga with the pass to get the flip in
Boy, that trap is a accurate description
I'm on my night job, finally got Bassy off the corner
'010 niggas thought he was a goner
He ducked shots, now it's "Bas we got a phoner"
I'm on my night job, flew the posse out to Rome and
Won't tell you 'bout no Basquiat, don't want 'em
Nigga, word to Selassie I, I'm zonin'
I'm on my night job
Too high to riot, that's my best excuse for being lazy
Being an artist, that's the best excuse for being crazy
I've been so infatuated, went to Clark and graduated
Now she on my face time and, my nigga, she just masturbated
Fuck a album release party, I'm out in the streets, shawty
How many rappers I killed—counted at least forty
Nah, I ain't God, but shawty down on her knees for me
I'm horny like that Coltrane album
A Love Supreme, that's Cole fave album
Lately, I've been dancing like a Soul Train album lately
Silly making songs talkin' 'bout how they hate me
They've been loving me this whole time
My only adversary was my own mind
Killed my ego now I'm snappin' like it's '09
With a gold mine of inspiration for y'all
Fuck your co-sign, that nigga can't fuck with Cole neither
Don't ask for a feature, we bring a whole liter of ether
To eat ya, we got heat for niggas, keep reachin'
If these bullets was heat-seeking
They wouldn't even reach you niggas
I'm on my...
Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's bein' born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end, as far as rap goes
It's only natural, I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin
You crossed my mind a thousand times
The cost was fine, I draw the line
I'm back, relapse, I'm fiending
Yes, what's that? In fact, I'm dreaming
Coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets
I got a shot at you, you wouldn't reach
Cop that, cock back, trigger release
Pop that top, take a sip of your holiest water
I know I'm a part of your flow now
Tell me you cut her
Don't matter you love her or not, you got part of her soul now
I ain't know then, but I know now
Apologies due, to one of the few
The ones I ran through, but never loved you
I pray you found peace and you whole now
I'm doin' better, I got me a chocolate bar
Climbin' on top of the bar
Think of the shape, and I lick in the places you only gon' lick when you rock with her forever
Hey... huh, Cole World
Yeah, everybody got a bad side, drop, let me see that shit
What you say? "Cole ain't hot," what?
Where you read that shit? You believe that shit?
All cause some lame nigga tweet that shit?
Have you seen my shows? Have you seen my hoes?
If I wasn't hot, would they be so thick?
Guess not, got the game in a headlock
I'm blasting that, I'm laughing at you old niggas, Redd Foxx
Don't mind me, boy, I'm red hot, aw, nigga, they not
I'm over here, I'm over there, I'm everywhere, they not (I said)
You'll never play me, nice try, balling in a nice spot
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch
You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot
So, you can look, but don't touch
I stay on my toes like the White Sox, cause
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it, I'll make that back, go
Ugh, nice watch (turn up)
Ugh, nice watch (I know)
Ugh, nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Hello, Mr. Nice Watch
Stack on black, I ain't never been a high-roller
Now it's racks on racks, never thought that I would ride Rover
But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober
Cole World but I'm hot as shit, do that mean that I'm bipolar?
Young, black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas Eve
Coach wouldn't let a nigga off the bench
Now wonder why I didn't quit the team, but
I'm cut from a different sleeve
Cole World 'til the wrist'll freeze
Hurry up with your pictures please, I gotta make history
They say time is money, but really it's not
And you can't make that back, no, you can't make that back
(Ugh, nice watch)
Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin’ fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don’t notice him
Your shoes too big to fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses, scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I’m better than Hov, but I’m the closest one
Heard you lookin’ for trouble, what, I’m 'sposed to run?
Yo bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I 'sposed to come?
Got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven’s gate, frontin’ like you know someone
Talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
Hmm, fuck it, e’rybody can get it
When you’re this hot, e'rybody’s a critic
But when you’re this high, e'rybody’s a midget
All this mean mugging from niggas that mean nothin'
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from, quarter to broke to half past rich
With my badass bitch, and you don’t want no problems
On some math class shit so check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiendin' ’bout
What you been praying fo'? What you been screamin' ’bout?
Ironic you been sleepin' on the one that you been dreamin' 'bout
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)
Tables do turn and labels do burn
The second they ask you to sell your soul
Don't you do it, don't you fold, say "Fuck that shit" and be bold
Cause all them stories you told on records worth more than gold
And if you never go gold again, at least you would know
The end of your road was chose, by you and not companies
Who control our remote control, and hide the truth on my no
But don't mind me, I'm just high again
Smokin' weed to get by again
No, actually I'm lyin' 'cause smokin' ain't got me smilin'
And rhyming like I rhyme way back when I would play the violin
Thought that shit wasn't cool
Momma sorry, I just stopped tryin' it
Paid for your house in hopes, there'd be no more reason for cryin'
That shows you how stupid I am 'cause niggas is out here dying
From police that flash the siren and pull up and just start firin'
Niggas murkin' each other in murky water, I try and swim
How the fuck do I look when I brag to you 'bout some diamond?
Said all that I could say, now I play with thoughts of retirement
My mind state feel like the crime in the summertime
Higher than average
Lot of cabbage
Thank God I never abide by the established
Guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
Commissioned by the state, I skate by the masters
Like "Yoo-hoo" with a new-new ridin' passenger
Shout out Oak Cliff, I'm 'bout to fly to Dallas
Decade from now I might just buy the Mavericks
What up, Mark Cuban?
I am only part human, half-man, half-amazing
Plus, I'm good at math like I'm Asian
Hate to use stereotypes—but that's light compared to what a nigga get from Caucasians
No race-baitin'—treat the beat like Playstation
Reporting to you live from the International Space Station
I probably vacation on Mars
The flow is out of this world and so is the bars
Blow the facade right off of your squad
Lil' rappers, I love you, but you ain't shit 'til you got offers in Prague
Look that shit up
A book, nigga, pick that shit up
Expand your vocab
I'm giving out toe tags for no cash
All summer long plus three seasons after
Please CC a rapper, tell him meet me
It's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
The problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
I'm the answer on the low, I'm a cheat sheet for rappers
I came up 'round AC to DC adapters
Plug talk, what I'm really sayin' is a shame but my niggas move 'caine like HBCU Kappas
Whole town full of CC Sabathia's
You think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack?
Not really
This is not the eighties, don't be silly
Now we push pills and sell heroin to Billy
Now Billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
How many black addicts that got caught up in the system
With no sob stories on your prime time television, I can smell a blatant contradiction
Man, listen
Don't want to fuck up my vibe
Let's end it on a positive note, come see me live
KOD—album of the year, undebatably
My cadence be the greatest we've seen since the late MC whose name was The Notorious—
Dreamville stacked like the Warriors
Winning back to back
Next up to bat is my nigga, Bas
After that, Jiddy-J.I.D
That's that New York City kid plus ATL
Me, I'm from the 'Ville, but I know them towns well
Before I had a deal I was givin' niggas hell
Now I'm givin' niggas deals and they givin' niggas hell
Nigga I grew up fast, then blew up fast
Money fallin out my pockets I got too much cash
Can't fit nothin in her pockets she got too much ass like goddamn
Well if you must ask
We from the school of hard knocks but your crew cut class
Half white but don't think I got a Klu Klux pass
When I'm up in the V, police be fuckin with me
No sir no license all I got here is this fuckin degree
Move along cocksucker ain't nothin to see
Unless you talkin blockbusters, you niggas is not Russell
You more Diggy - me I'm more Biggie
No diss to the young boy im just rappin get bored quickly
Just to make up for that line invite him on tour with me
Show him the game let him finagle these whores with me
Run through they doors with me, hit the Ritz-Carlton for the night
Leave him there with two dykes probably change a nigga life right
What up Vanessa, I loved you that one semester
Thanks to my profession I balled like Uncle Fester
Thinkin about the board I use to have above the dresser
Half the shit I wrote down I did it, its old now got
New goals, plus my money on Manute Bol
Funny how my old highs is suddenly my new lows
Tired of every chick sayin she models before she swallow
So I only fuck with hat tricks, bitches with a few goals
Niggas keep askin me how I feel how ya feel
It's Coleee
Not even slightly interested in what ya opinion is
I gotta greater purpose then a hater purpose
I'mma stack paper, hustle just to relax later
Serve niggas and bring change that's a waiter's purpose
Look how I made em nervous, niggas is shakin, I know they fakin'
Okay you a killer right, and Miss Cleo is Jamaican
And Bob Marley is Haitian and me and Beyonce datin'
And Jesus Christ be hatin, got mad love from Satan
For fuckin Sanaa Lathan while Meagan Good is waitin'
I'm the deadbeat father of your little brother
In other words goddamnit I'm a bad motherfucker
It's Cole, it's only right I brought back the soul
Y'all got way too electro, damn near techno
Halfway homo, way too metro
Hennesy XO, Cole flow special
Style like Tribe Called Quest meets Death Row
Learn somethin boy, grow yo ass up
Cheap nigga if you was liquor I'd probably throw yo ass up
Matter a fact if you was grass I'd probably mow yo ass up
Last call for you old niggas go and pour yo last cup
Yea, yea, yea yea, Cole World
This nigga Ib...he's a bitch
He told me to talk shit to you niggas, so I'mma talk my shit
Dreamville in the building
I know what y'all want me to talk about, what y'all want to me to discuss
But we'll get to that later; them bitch ass niggas...
My nigga Big Sean in the building
My nigga Canei on the beat
Death to the imposters, label me the king
My dreams could win Oscars, my niggas turned mobsters
My white friends doctors, fatherless child
Listen how I got this knowledge is wild
Streets taught me, speak softly nigga watch from the crowd
Cause any nigga that's loud, just want attention and eventually blaow
No fake niggas allowed in my circle dawg
You been through half the shit I been through it'll hurt ya dawg
Tread softly, my nigga moving state-to-state, running late, watch 'em
Tryna avoid state troopers, that's the weight watchers
Run this dope set, this cake, till they say, "Gotcha"
Or till the fat lady sings, and niggas hate operas
And Oprah hate niggas
Make no mistake that we know the stake still, we hope to make over eight figures
Slim chances, but niggas bet against the odds and who am I to criticise how you play your cards dawg
Cause I done beat the odds going way too hard
I been getting slept on for way too long
I been patiently waiting for way too long
I been quiet dawg for way too long
You can't knock the hustle dawg it's way too strong
It's way too strong
I said you can't knock my hustle dawg it's way too strong
Look, I never admit it, tryna get my brother acquitted
Yo' tell the judge I be happy to pay him off if he's with it
My flesh and blood, hauled off to the cell
I search for heaven as I see him getting lost in this hell
Headed for coffin or jail, to never try is the ultimate fail
But love is wanting more for someone than they want for themselves
Deep, I guess I love a lot
Because the more I do my thang the more I feel the guilt and shame that my brother's not
Reminisce as we was kids screaming "Fuck a cop"
Guess he took it serious, for me that shit was just for props
Arms too skinny to hug the block
I found comfort in my dreams of things seen on the screen of fortune and fame
Decisions, decisions, the Porsche or the Range
I take a trip back to the 'Ville only corpses remain
Some of them niggas still breathing but they dead inside
Victims of a genocide
Tears fill my eyes dawg
Cause I've been out of touch man for way too long
I've been out in Hollywood for way too long
I've been, getting this paper for way too long
I ain't called my pops back in way too long
I done make my girl wait for way too long
I wonder if I changed, am I way too on?
Can't knock my hustle, but it's way too strong
Cozz & Effect
Let me hear that back
If I smoke a blunt right now
I'ma be on 285 with my pants pulled down around my ankles
Still no stranger to the blunt smoke, gun smoke
You niggas don't want smoke
No guts like that Swisher we just smoked
We cutthroat, niggas ain't...
This for all my niggas in the city
But this shit really for Queens though
Really for Queens though, ya know?
Big city of dreams, motivated by schemes
Getting money regiment with my get money regime
Nah mean? yeah
New York times, come listen to these New York rhymes
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings
Getting to the money, it seems, by any means
As I, watch it all pan out, try not to stand out
Fish out of water, yet an official reporter
Up here, life is a bitch, I blow a kiss at her daughter
In the city where niggas will leave you shit outta order
So yeah, you heard the news, disturbing news
Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once
My nigga visibly stressin', a mess, he smoking his blunt
What could I say, I can't relate to that, all I do is pray for that
This the city of God told me "Go and make it" at
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that
Grab a paper, hey kid, you gotta pay for that
The New York Times, yeah
The New York Times
Extra, extra, read all about it
They say you can win anywhere if you can win here
And you ain't been no where if you ain't been here
Hustle hard, yeah it really ain't a game mane
Same places, different faces, on the train mane
New York, New York
Hop on the F train, took the express train
Skip that local shit, my vocals sick, that's how success came
Once kings now we pawns in this chess game
Wall street got black slave blood stains
Which means, we built this city
And never got scraps while the devil got fat
In fact, reparations for niggas in desperation
Fuck money, get my kid a real education
Blood money spills, had a real revelation
Southside make you realize there's still segregation
Don't wanna preach I'm just thinking out loud
Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how
My motive, to lead my niggas to paradise
Imagine the world, free from pain
And we no longer scared at night
Far from the crime, the blind leading the blind
We dont make it primetime till we dyin'
You like the flower that I won’t let die
Right before your petals start to wilt
I choose to give you one last try
Fill your vase up with water, refusin’ to neglect you
Like your father, so I promise that it won’t run dry
Good intentions 'cause I wanna see us both fly
But I often put me first and I been wonderin’ why
I know you probably think you’re blessed
To have a wonderful guy
And that’s the truth but at the same time a wonderful lie
Cause to me you’re a dime and I’m still a nickel
And you know niggas say that every coin got two sides
Well if you knew both minds not sure you’d like what you find
I made mistakes, I want to tell you but can’t make up my mind
As I’m writing this I see a red balloon in the sky
And to me that’s a sign tellin’ me that these lines
Were meant to be written, repentin’ in the form of a rhyme
I know the Lord’s a forgiver, hope he’ll forgive me in time
In my freshest J's, I ain’t slept in days
Girl, you gonna make me late undressing me
Know you ain’t seen me since yesterday
But, see, I got a date with destiny
Cause this the summer that our life change
Hov asked me, “Is you ready for it?”
I looked around at all his nice things
Told him, “Nigga, you already know it”
Bitch, I’m the man of the year
Straight through this bitch
What you ‘sposed to do when the OG niggas don’t get it?
Lost what was once theirs but they won’t quit it
Homie, it’s a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers
Lemme show you how to move in a room
Full of dudes that don’t got a fuckin’ clue how to do this
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik
My President is black, but my jeweler’s still Jewish
So you know it cost, he makin’ a killing off me
Red diamonds he designing got me shining
Spotlight cover my body, my chain blinding
A cop light runner, they wanna but can’t find him
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica
Seen how he was living, said “I gotta get my weight up”
Formulated my plan, motivated by dreams
Parlayed with my mans, motivated my team
Ced said, “Look, my niggas, we got a foot in”
Being good is good, that’ll get you Drew Gooden
But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footin’
Can’t guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden
Garbage? Hardly, you niggas silly like Chris Farley
So like him, you’ll be gone too early
Mama hands together like 6:30
And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley
All my ’90s niggas is gon’ get it
18 and under, that’s prolly gonna take a minute
I’mma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
At the time of this rhyme, 5 years ’til I know 30
Cole World in the summer brings snow flurries
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, ’cause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doin’ jumpin’ jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin’ laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin’ strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Live by the trigger, ’cause no father figure
Means you don’t got a nigga comin’ ’round to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringin’ home these rotten niggas
Blowin’ reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak fo’
To give the young niggas somethin’ they could reach fo’
You better dream, boy
Yeah, I stunt, but I’m a li’l more realer
When it come from the heart, don’t it feel mo’ iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, I’m a li’l gorilla
So pardon me, man, y’all gon’ have to pardon me
They say I rep that ‘Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me
It’s flowin’ out through my arteries, who hard as me? You JV, I’m varsity
No field trip, ain’t hard to see, this real shit, you R&B
Seen a movie wit’ yo’ bitch in it, and listen it, was starin’ me
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter than Ike Turner temper, you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I’d fail
It’s Judgment Day, I’m here to give you pussy niggas hell
And some food for thought, I can serve a plate
With dessert to take, with dessert to take
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin’ over
It’s like I’m fuckin’ Oprah, well worth the wait
Maybe over your head, I’m ahead of my time
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadin’ my prime
Cause I only made classics, now what that take? Timing
Cole under pressure, what that make? Diamonds
Cole World, the new Nat King
If I ain't the illest nigga, I'm his new vaccine
Really more like poison when his New Jack Swing
And my bed is like a deck of cards - two black queens
A nigga don't like me, he just a fucking hater
What you made last week, I just tipped the fucking waiter
What that feel like? Tell me what that feel like?
Nigga fuck your Twitter, bitches follow me in real life
Welcome back, ladies and gentleman, to a brand new season. Dreamville, Cole World. So much has happened in our time apart
I can’t wait to share it with you all in due time. Did you miss me?
I know I missed you. Can’t believe these niggas ain’t rap on this shit man...
Heard niggas got beef
Then they see me on the street, and don't speak
Heard niggas dropping songs every week, but they weak
Yeah, I heard about your deal, hope they keep the receipt
Heard niggas out there saying I would be Memphis Bleek
Well, how you feel when that nigga got mills?
And you sitting, commenting, discussing on how you feel
Bout another nigga shit, or another nigga chips
Meanwhile I’m on the strip, putt puttin’ wit ya bitch
Cut something in the 6 then dip to 160
Bitch don’t fuck with me, trust nigga I’m sick
Can’t tag me, fuck nigga I’m it—watch this
With my heart on my sleeve I bleed pardon my greed
I plead insanity, with a side of vanity
How can it be I blew up singlehandedly
Nobody handed me shit
Granted though, I planned to be rich
Understandably, funny how I talk so candidly
On cameras but won’t holla at family only randomly
After a few drinks come our realest convos
My handle on my thoughts used to be as ill as Rondo’s
Screaming fuck whitey, forgetting I’m still mulatto
Ay reverend, will I get to heaven, he said “hell if I know,” shit
Stay scheming, day dreaming, chain gleaming
Name should be Abe Lincoln ‘cause I cannot tell a lie though
All facts in fact, been all that
Before Kenan and Kel swallow the key to my cell
Which means, I got an impossible lock to pick
And if you want my spot, you gotta go through lots of shit
Nigga, Cole the truth, you the opposite
I be tryna figure out why I cannot commit
With who I’ve known for years, is it hoes or fear
Meanwhile she wonder if the one she chose is pure
No cure for the cold, rather Cole the cure
Them last lines was more honest than your whole career
Nigga, you a phony, only got few homies
I prefer lonely, you rap niggas don’t know me
Staying to myself, not concerned ‘bout my health
I’m a mothafucka and yo baby mother is a milf
Couple years ago they had a nigga sitting on the shelf
Now they tell me “man you like the realest shit I ever smelt”
They say, “Boy you got the belt"
"Plus you better than so-and-so!”
I keep it modest but inside I already know it though
Yea thanks my nigga, yea thanks my nigga
I deserve but nah this ain’t Tank my nigga
Leave the party like I just robbed a bank my nigga
Bag full of money, fuck yo debate my nigga
‘Cause two years ago and I ain’t make it, I was pissed
But you care a little less about a list when you rich, nigga
When you rich nigga...
But that’s not what we came here for. We didn’t come here to brag; we didn’t come here to boast, to stunt. We just came here to flex. Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate your patience. I assure you, it’ll be well worth the wait. In the meantime, if I can get right back into it though. Check it...
How many Kanye beats do a nigga gotta murder
To prove my mind’s further, hater nigga converter
Took kids to Carowinds which I’m sure you never heard of
‘Cause I didn’t tell the news or the Fayetteville Observer
I don’t do it for the press, I’m blessed, I made it out
Sitting on this plane, my biggest thing to complain about
Somewhere between yesterday and now
I done lost my jewelry, Rollies, chains, almost lost my cool
But see, I just left kids who ain’t got a fucking thing
‘Cept a lot of fucking problems and a lot of fucking pain
And here I go bitching ‘cause my Jesus piece missing
Got a feeling housekeeping finally caught a nigga slipping
Eyes wide open, they just found a pot of gold
Now lil’ Julio is somewhere shining on you hoes
But that’s how it goes, fuck it I’m still breathing
Like my lil’ nigga Jaheim, we here for a reason
That’s my lil’ man Jaheim. He said, “Cole, can you shout me out on a song?” I was like, “I don’t know man,” but in my mind I knew I would shout him out though, you know—Fayettenam, 2-6. Dreamville. We from a different world. Cole World...
Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you
Special, never forget the day I met you
We was destined for each other like a, son to his mother, or a
Sister and brother, man this bond is deep
We go a couple years and don't even speak
But know it's love though
Could never let 'em dirty your name
I got the utmost respect for you
Came back home and had to check for you
Word round town is you locked down
Some older nigga snatched you up gave you a rock now
Damn, hey could it be—
She like, "If you was me you wouldn't wait for me
Living fast and wouldn't mash the brakes for me"
Big city slicker nigga on a higher track
Bigger now but when she send a letter always write her back and
Time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon
While she see me go for mines and she admire that
We speak about time as if we could just buy it back
If only it was that simple, damn I miss you
Ay let me holla at you!
Yeah I know it's been a while but ain't no better time than now
Yeah I know it's been a while, but—
You betrayed me
The day you played my momma you played me
Can't believe I let you in my heart nigga
I shoulda, followed my instincts, a stranger in my house
Only five years old but sensed danger in my house
I was too young to scrap you, but damn if I ain't want to
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you, uh
Thirteen years, knew you more than my real pops
Put me on to 'Pac and all the rappers that killed cops
Who woulda thought that you'd leave my momma high and dry
Last words to a bitch nigga "why you lie?"
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled
When you left I watched that lady crumble
I know by now you probably a old man
But I still I feel I won't be satisfied until we throw hands
For all the ass whoppings
Heard you tryna talk, tell that punk don't call me
You ain't shit, and I'm scared it rubbed off on me
I holla at you
I heard you on that shit, I hope it ain't true
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ain't you
'Cause you ain't lookin' like that nigga that I once knew
And plus you act like you don't know me
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name
See me do my thing so you expected me to act strange
Ain't holla but you on my mind nigga
I don't forget the good times nigga
White tees in the club, jeans baggy as fuck
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff
We had potential to be monumental, 'ville mentality
You know that old kill-or-be-killed mentality
I look at where you at now it's a, real fatality
'Cause where you s'posed to be is on top, close to me
Chasin' hoes like the old days, but now we overseas
Dawg, congratulations on your seed
Yo my nigga
When this shit dropped I was like 16
Tryna get some head from a mixed thing, big dreams
Say goodbye to ripped jeans, nigga got a job
Had my little wad, worst fear was getting robbed
For my last 50 dollars that I had left over
Five dollars and they pop a nigga in his left shoulder
Minimum wage, $5.15
13′s on the whip, kept my shit clean, uh
Actually that was my mama shit
But I’m drivin' 'round town on my Obama shit
Middle-class my ass, just to get a tank of gas
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But yeah, I’m headed for a scholarship
Little scrap game, but I got a lot of lip
That's why them niggas don’t like me and always wanna fight me
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth, most likely, uh
I know the game, I’m an expert
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?
Nigga I’m gone, showed up at the crib tryna bone
And I ain't fuck yet 'cause her mama always home
God damn, Lord have mercy
Please God, don’t let this little broad have herpes
My nigga say she fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Gold medals if we gave hoes medals
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos
Spiderman sheets, got her singing falsetto
Tall white tee’s, can’t believe we used to wear those
White folks looking at us like we’re weirdos
But we was only kiddos
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of skittle
Tryna get the kitty was like tryna solve a riddle
Tryna get to Diddy, 'cause I murder instrumentals
This that good old fashioned Mark Jackson
Fucked then I’ll pass, y’all Utah Jazz-in'
Ya borin’, I don’t play nigga, I’m Mark Madsen
That's why my knots thick like a fucking Kardashian
I’m not askin', my nigga I don’t need favors
I’m in the streets with the fiends, I done seen danger
My team major, we party like teenagers
I’m in the green Range, nigga I’m the Green Ranger
I fucking ran outta breath, heh
Team major, we party like teenagers
Cole
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like (Like, like, like...)
Hey, hey!
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, there ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle
Dog my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds go to gamble
Ha, bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealin' with some real-life shit
She be askin' "When?", Bitch! When I feel like it
Cole World (World), Cole Life (Life), Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy! Ha, ha, ha!
I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here, hey!
Uh, turn up the 808's for me (Woohoo!)
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me (Woohoo!)
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story (Woohoo!)
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me
They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew
See, when you're spittin' so real
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
Got em' feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be
I think they scared of me, and they should be
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
Hm, Ok, we're outta here (O-o-o-key-key-key)
I think it's safe to say we outta here
(We outta here, we outta here, we-we-we)
We outta here
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night (Night, night, night)
A hell of a night (Night, night, night)
So we could do whatever you like (Like, like, like)
Hey (Hey, hey, hey...)
Na, na, na, na, my nose runnin'
Got my shades over this
The whole skyline of the city's right in front of my face, yeah
I'm in the zone this year, it's all fire nigga check my attire
Your worst fear is confirmed, your reign at the top expires this year
No application, I'm hired this year
This a dedication to that bitch who slashed my nigga tires, oh yeah
I knew about you, bitch I knew about you
Came up on a good nigga, he ain't have a clue about you
Tried to tell that nigga, don't trust that bitch as far as you can smell her, nigga
But you live and you learn
On these road to riches niggas bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you cross turn into bridges you burn
You're bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you.. fuck it you don't hear me
Look, ayo, I walk along this long harbor of life and sit on the piers
Reflect on my pain and shit on my fears
Should I feel an ounce of guilt that I outdid all my peers?
Or write my name in the sky and show them niggas I'm here?
This one is for the history books, picture me shook or failin'
This is revenge of the dreamer
Misery took a million of my niggas' hopes from 'em, don't even know some 'em
No more, the coke numbed 'em, no suicide notes from 'em
They killin' theyselves, slowly killin' they cells
Five iPhones dropped, my nigga still in the cell
He said he found God, shit, I doubt it, to each his own
Whatever keeps you strong to get up out it, we need you home
Cause see a war's goin' on outside, I 'bout cried
When that boy that the cops shot died, my mouth wide open from shock
Sick and tired of hopin' it'll stop
This pen the only hope that I got, I open up shop, and break out
Got what you want, I got what you need
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink
Nigga my shit won't sink, cause it can't, I break out!
I gotta break the fuck up outta here
War stories, got tour stories
Pop-four-whores-on-the-top-floor stories
Niggas know, every verse is worth a brick of blow
Just a seven figure nigga got the game in figure four
I know at times I'm hypocritical, you niggas dig it though
I fuck until my dick be sore, leave bitches walkin' pigeon toe and break out!
On to the next bitch, homie
Your new chick—that's my ex-bitch, homie—in fact, I'm still logged in her Netflix, homie
Just make sure she cook you breakfast, homie
Her bacon slammin' but her eggs get runny—funny
So many bombs, you'd think Flex get money from me
Cole world but my neck get sunny
Now I don't fuck around with hoes from reality shows
Or blow-up dolls, 'cause I don't like havin' sex with dummies, love me
No disrespect meant, honey, this just a compilation of my observations
While trapped in this God-forsaken nation
Shit, but since we makin' conversation
I've been thinkin' me and you would make a bangin' combination
I know that you mad, I know what I said
But my dick be arguin' with my head, are you with the bed?
Well if so let's break out!
Got money to make, blow out the candles then cut up the cake
Then I put it on plate, I'm running the game, you running in place
Still a youngin' at heart, but mentally, bitch I'm a hunnid'-and-eight
Like Pun in the late 90s, my niggas is juggling weight
Running from state to state, gun in the waist for safety
I'm on a paper chase, whatever it takes to make me
A millionaire, silly 'cause how many really get there?
I mean, how many niggas is Jeezy?
Y'all make this shit sound so easy
Breezy, turn on the TV, see these niggas that trap on the CD
Meanwhile, back home, my niggas sell crack at the BP
Hoping one day they can be thee
Niggas is there on the screen
'Cause that's the American Dream
Now here go the thing, listen
Hysterical screams, coming from mothers that buried their kings
Or the unbearable pain of watching 'em walk out with the sheriff in chains
Becoming a number, they no longer care about the name
White folks been getting rich off of cocaine
Through some underhanded methods, I don't got time to explain
Out of fear that I won't reach 'em and since preaching ain't my thing
I just drop a gem or two within a few verses I sing
For all my real niggas trapped inside the game
You know that already
Promethazine in a baby bottle
Meditatin' on daily dollars
Lately problems stem from my bitch
'Cause she know I still fuck with my baby mama
So there be drama in the house, I gotta find a outlet
Waitin' on a plug just like a fuckin' outlet
Fuck it, I'm turnin' my phone off
Fantasies of grabbin' the heat and burnin' my nose off
Blaow! Niggas might not know but I'm slightly throwed off
And I might need Zoloft, but for now, these Xannies'll do
Hear the sound, a manic depressive
That ain't been prescripted, what can he do?
Anywho, boy, when you got it, you keep a close watch
On the ones that's befriendin' you (Friendin' you)
Them'll be the ones that's envy you (Envy you)
Vividly dreamin' 'bout endin' you (Endin' you)
But when you low, they don't tend to you (Tend to you)
Actin' new when they run into you (Into you)
Fuckin' your bitch tryna feel like you (Feel like you)
This the message I send to you
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (Look both ways)
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (Hmm-mm)
Look both ways 'cause if you cross me, I kill ya
Am I changing right before your eyes?
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the flies
I'm touching skies, no puffing lye
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Goin' finally give a nigga leg room in the whip
From a Civic to a seven must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11, please go find a reverend
You see I promised that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga, Othello
I'm balling with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmelo
Now the crib got much rooms, Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit your ass down like you was playing a cello
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win
No sweat like a headband in
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No it can't get no better for me
I'ma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I paid dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned it so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke, you would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings cause now all the chicks feeling him
You gotta adapt though I'm never going back
I can't keep running away
I swear I'm coming back one day
What if I'm wrong
And I ain't got what it takes
Then all them people that was counting on me
Boy won't you climb down the mountain for me
Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you
Sponsored by The Primary Market
And everything'll follow, got to
Free your mind and everything'll follow, gotta
Free your mind and everything'll ... Cole
My nigga just made bail
Tell the good Lord, we gon raise hell
We gon pop off, like a fake nail
Take the top off and get ill get ill get
Tell the fuckin mayor he got hate mail
Less shakedowns and more Shakespeare
Please, all these niggas don't care
Prepare for the new shit, that Cole is the truth shit
Nigga this is Lute shit, nigga this is Bas shit
Meaning this some true shit, telling you shit
Bout the crew, how we do shit, who sick?
And, tell my niggas in the two-six in the coupe
I'mma kick back smoke a pool stick
This for my new chick tryin get fit say she too thick
Ain't no such thing as too thick, what you wanna be a toothpick?
What you wanna get your cooch licked?
Well I'm tryna get my flute played
If we the new slaves
I am Frederick Douglass of rhetoric ahead the the others
You motherfuckas better get free
This for that insecure girl, your name I won't mention
On Instagram straight flickin'
Bitch you a nipple slip away from strippin'
Might as well, get your clientele up, you a pioneer
Them girls fuck for free, I'm never buying there
Save that shit for the D.R
I rock crowns and these niggas rock tiaras or tiaras
'Cause I'm Pete Carroll, left college and I fucked the pros up
Guess it ain't luck when the luck just shows up
Like every verse on the spot, shit is never rehearsed
You heard it first, Bas
Free your mind and everything'll follow, won't you, won't you
Hurt, to think that you lied to me
Hurt, way down deep inside of me
And it breaks my heart...
Get paid a pretty Penny for my thoughts
I'm Hardaway with grammar, I'm hot
They only care 'bout a nigga when he handle the rock
Or when he dishing the pill, or when he grippin' the steel
Bailing out my brother, tell the lawyer "get the appeal"
With the flick of the pen, write the check and he out
Two years later he be at my shows checking me out
Know he proud of lil bro and how my records be out
Flashbacks to childhood when he was deckin' me out
Now it's clear lil Maine is the best mc out
Hands down, flow water, can't drown
My flow father, go harder, Cole smarter
Shout out to fiends in Queens, I'm team no daughters
I seen it all at this young age
The only thing left to do is die and hit front page
Should I knock on wood and pray like God forbid?
These hoes be poppin' pills, these niggas be poppin' shit, bitch
Pac on the mic in his prime
They only care 'bout a nigga when he writing a rhyme, boy
Kenny Lofton, you feelin' my pace?
They only care 'bout a nigga when he stealin' the base
It's like I'm Wilt the Stilt, I'm fucking them all
They only care 'bout a nigga when he dunkin' the ball, mane
And it breaks my heart
The world’s a stage, I'll just play my part
Just caught fire like a young Richard Pryor with unforgettable quotes
They only care 'bout a nigga when tellin' a joke, or when he's sellin' his dope
They tell the reverend "Man, I rather get to heaven with coke
Then live in hell and be broke"
Shout out to black man who beat the odds by yellin' for hope
Today he asked if I could Twitter y'all and tell you to vote
My nigga, how could I, knowing what I know
It's a game of charades, masquerade for the dough
Read the teleprompter these niggas is actors on the low
Yeah I voted for the nigga 'cause he got the best show
Like I got the best flow
On your mark, set, go
Mama got us out the hood but we still ghetto
Look, I just shed tears homie and no I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
When I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left em' I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, ‘cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame ‘cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowing through our veins is the same
My mama left you and it may be that anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be telling you “fuck you” ‘cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help but...
Break down
I break down
Can't help but break down
Yeah, I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit, man
It's fucking with her body, now she sick, damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
You made a milli off of serving hard white? Yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shooting niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bulletproof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruiting niggas
We trying to stand tall when it get too crucial niggas
Break down, we break down
We break down, we break down
Break the break down
Yeah, He's serving time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know
His daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt she love him, yeah that's for sure
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know? Never know
And so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freaking, but them niggas holla, but she never speakin'
But tonight I see the devil creeping
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She doin the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please
Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Please
Don't break down
Yeah, don't break down
Uh, break the break down...
Break, break down
Steady break me down
Steady break me down...
"Yeah, nigga
I'ma go ahead and murder this shit
Voice gone and shit, I think it's gon' make it sound a lil'–a lil' ill...
A lil' iller
Yeah, fayettenam... nigga."
Yeah, Carolina blue kicks, pedal to the metal
Feeling like a puppet and the Devil is Geppetto
Letter to the ghetto, hold your head high
You can pick apart my raps, I ain’t told ya na’ lie
My world a little darker, like a fuckin' tan line
Go on, look for a better nigga: girl you can’t find
Fine young man with an old man mind
No time for the chick who fucked the whole mankind
Aw, no ma’am, I’m an old land mine
I been waiting to blow up for a long damn time
Now I’m armed and I’m Fayetnam’s finest
Carolina’s savior, marijuana blazer
Only on occasion 'cause my mind be racin'
Lost in my thoughts so my eyes be Asian
Thinking how these rap niggas gotta be fakin'
Whole style obviously copied, pasted
Plagiarized swag, may arrive last
But when it’s all said and done I’mma be ahead of them
Way that I describe it, prescribe a nigga medicine
What that I be fly I be higher than the Jet-a-sons
Moving on up, nigga higher than the Jeffersons
All about the Benjamins. Bad chicks? Send em in
Basic hoes? Toss em out, can’t even get Waffle House
Hatin’ niggas? Chalk em out. Go on, get the coffin out
What you talking about? Lil man
My shit here burning, you not even lil’ tan
I’m ill enough to kill cancer: baby, I’m chemo
Down in Miami and I'm throwed like Marino
Get a whole lot of you-know and she bald like an Eagle
No, not on top but down there
She say she want to hop on top, "girl, I don’t care"
You better get yours fore I reach mine
Cause then I’m throwing peace signs
If you a freak, I can take you to your peak
Girl, I do it to the maximum: Nissan
And I hope you a believer
I’m quarterbacking, trying to get you open like receivers
Far from an overnight achiever, Cole is like the leader
Of the new niggas, to tell the truth I’m only fucking with a few niggas
If that, the rest of you niggas get lapped, I sit back
And reflect on the rap game
I came from out of nowhere
Nigga, I swear them lames ain’t know how to prepare
Got niggas shouting out “The ‘Ville, I gotta go there”
Boy don’t you know you get shot over there?
I say my prayers cause this life ain’t fair
A bunch of backstabbing niggas, hope the knife ain’t there
A bunch of temptation facing when your wife ain’t there
Yeah late at night, when I got the phone call and made a right
But my crib was straight ahead, shorty gave me head
Hit it then I quit it ‘fore she even made the bed
Damn I’m no good, but damn it’s so good
I’m picturing that body like a camera phone would
Something like Rihanna while I’m up in that vagina
Type of chick that only dress in something that’s designer
I could give a fuck as long as there’s something that’s behind of her
Got the type of bump that make a dog wanna hump
Back to the topic, actually forgot it
Hoes, money, I’m the shit...oh yeah, I’m reminded
The way I put the words together, cleverly align em
These other rap niggas should never be a problem
And I’m ghost
I phone home to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil nigga from the Ville could get a deal?
Ay, tell them niggas at the top we want yo spot we are for real
And yeah, we heard you got it locked but like them socks, we on your heels
So you best be on your toes nigga, especially on your flows nigga
Cause man they keep on checking for me, especially all your hoes nigga
Catch me on your doorstep, you see me, let me in
All I wanna do is eat, I'm like a freaky lesbian
Now all I wanna do is ball on TV, need ESPN
They heard I'm 'bout to blow so all my enemies say let's be friends
And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then
Where all the girls we knew that screamed fuck you going let me then
I'm definitely in a class of my own, at dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton, he just passed the Patron
Ain't nothing given dawg, it's earned if you just living, dog, you learn
I let you niggas see the light, I'm like the prison yard, I yearn
For that living large, but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your sunrise, kick back and know your son set
Forever I ain't run yet, and I never will, Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said fuck the world and I ain't come yet, you up yet
My punchlines like gut checks I'm raw-dog, I'm rough sex
I'm on deck, I'm up next, I'm God blessed, I'm success
So fuck stress, you can get the fuck from 'round me
And if you listening, know you wondering where the fuck they found me
I'm from the Ville, boy, ay Wale, good looking
Yeah, often I'm caught up in confusion, in need of dissolution
They tell me the solution to see through this illusion I'm living
A few friends killed, a few sent to prison
Our mamas tried to warn us, but few tend to listen
See, we running the streets, in search of some trouble, at least
A couple of freaks to sneak home with
Now she ride a nigga dick, just like she owned it
So every time I wanna hit, I bet you she on deck
She got the bad lips, bad hips, damn shawty
Slim waist, Gina face, Pam body
Met her in the club, little liquor led to love
That's the reason why my niggas can't find me, good golly
Look, shawty, ain't no need for games
I know a nigga still young, but I don' seen some things
If it's cool to talk, let me ease your pain
This is food for thought, let me feed your brain
Your ex-man did you dirty, did he leave a stain?
When them losers talk, tell 'em "please refrain."
I refuse to stop, don't freeze the frame
Cause tonight, I got you calling out Jesus name, hey
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk, we must crawl
But we run when temptation calls
Before we walk we must crawl
I'm losing temptation
Smoke in my nappy dreads, how you scared to die, nigga?
Don't believe that lie, I think that everybody happy dead
Hell is a fabricated figment of imagination
I done seen worse for real right there off Yadkin behind gas station
Cambridge Homes, 'partments where the girls get damaged young
From overexposure to the vultures
That prey on them like pastors is supposed to
If they wasn't so concerned about the tags that's on they clothes, but
Guess that's how it goes, fuck it, what do I know?
Ain't been in service since Jim Jones had somethin' with Hov
I document my life with rap beefs, love songs, favorite albums
In years that my niggas got blood on they sneakers from bodies they might’ve caught
I don’t judge no one, I'm just knowin’
At night, when it get quiet, that shit could fuck with 'em
And if it don't right now, it's gon’ catch up to 'em
Guilt heavy as a cloud in a thunderstorm, huh
My niggas blowing loud like an elephant
It's helpin' 'em to cope, I don't do nothin' if it don't
Make somethin', make a dollar
Make me wonder, make me prouder
Make me karma, make me better
I ain't no killer, don't make me have to, nigga
You want my spot, well maybe after, nigga
So active on the radio, I'm radioactive, nigga
That's a bar, I had to give it to 'em
Never slouching, not even on couches in the living room
And I feel like the world is ending soon
Is the ending good or bad? Well that's depending on you
And if you wake up in time
I know it's better to be sleep, that's why we hate the alarm
I feel you
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all
I hit the weed, I told myself the last time would be my last
I don’t trust my own niggas, now my mind racing fast
Got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash
If the police run up on me I ain't stopping for their ass
Boy, you know my L’s dirty, if they stop me I’m goin' to jail surely
I’ll be next to my brother in the cell, no bail for me
"Man, let me out, send me back to bitches that smell purdy"
And all I gotta do is call once and she 'dere all ready
Yeah, buddy, can't you tell I'm goin; through hell
I don’t even open my mail
I’m in the shower with soap and the towel, I need cleansing
Bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes
Pussy niggas running they mouth and we ain't flinching
They names ain't even mentioned
I got dreams bigger than your whole team
You niggas so broke yet somehow you so green
I guess it's envy, started with a penny now i’m getting plenty money
And one time for the city, yeah
And two times for you, hey
And one time for the city, hey
And two times for you, uhh
Look kid, its raining outside boy
Fuck an umbrella, niggas banging outside boy
They guns'll dumbbell a nigga
Tired of telling niggas that's deceased, rest in peace
We tired of only having just a piece
And fuck policing, they killing niggas what's the reason
His daughter starving and she fucking freezing
So no wonder why he fucking squeezing
They out here bussin’ leavin’ niggas stuck and bleedin’ on the flo’
Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho
Breathing slow man, I'm in hell
One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail
Lord knows he meant well
So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal
Some shit that’s darker than the tints up on the windshield
Welcome to Sinville where niggas on base
Shit is looking like an infield
High as a Sprint bill
What you think, that's the reason why this ink in my pen kills
Phoney niggas until they are extinct, bitch I’ve been real
Them old niggas sayin’
Cole the wrong one bringin’ the city shine
All he ever doin’ is paintin’ pictures of crime
Tellin’ stories of pain, paintin’ pictures of dope
Bitch if you listenin' I’m paintin’ pictures of hope
That boy in class embarrassed because he broke
Hopin’ today he won’t be the butt of somebody’s joke
See me I lived it all from dirt-poor in a trailer
Worried about my mother and never trustin’ my neighbors
To middle-class with a backyard and my own room
To bein’ the only black kid in my homeroom
Academically gifted and followed my own rules
Was runnin’ the streets hey ma I’ll be home soon
Was out chasin’ hoes, was out hoopin’
Them niggas wasn’t ballin’ but yet they was foul shootin’
So meet the newest role model who don’t know how to fake this shit
Never sold a rock and look I made it bitch
Girl it’s been so long, I’ve been gone from you
But you ain’t gotta worry ’bout the thangs I do
It’s hard but the thought of you would ease my pain
Girl I promise they gon’ know our name
Ain’t seen you smile in awhile
But I been dreamin’ ’bout you
Damn
Heheheh
Ugh
Damn, Cole World
I never thought I see that day that you my old girl
Now I’m stuck here hollerin' at ol' girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut-one, hut-two, told them hoes take a hike
Then it’s on to the next—on—on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one
I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Tryna celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl, who I’m kidding? Still sick, real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be, you everything that these plain bitches couldn’t be?
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn’t be?
Lost in the player way, sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you got a hold on me
I say, "I’m wrong", you say, "Come again?"
Damn, said I was wrong, look don’t rub it in
I got a lot on my mind, got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes, how they coming in
Just sayin', don’t wanna have me then somebody will
I’m playin', weight on my chest like I body build
I’m prayin', you ain’t content with tryna do your thang
And come back baby, boomerang, 'rang, huh
I tried, you tried, we tried
All of the times that we had together
We should've known nothing last forever
(Can't say we didn't try though, can't say we didn't try, hey)
(Can't say we didn't try tho, can't say we didn't try, hey)
When this shit end, man it's gon get ugly
Real real ugly, your grandmama love me
And your mama love me, little sister hugs me
Even got a few homegirls that wanna fuck me
Soon as this shit end, forget about it
You been stayin' in my crib, you gotta get up out it
Cause if you layin' in my bed, let's admit about it
One time fuckin' and we no longer upset about it
Cause when this shit ends it's either all or nothin'
I thought you loved me, how the hell you gon call ya cousin?
You know the diesel ass, half slow, evil ass
Nigga in that Honda showin' up with that drama
On my mama, we been through it all
From the goods to the bads, rise to the fall
You done seen me at my best, seen me at my worst
So when this shit ends, know it's gon hurt
They say we won't last
I know you suspicious, but you don't ask
And I don't tell, that's where we both fell
A good nigga gone bad
Good chick, alone, mad as fuck, she done had enough
I be, out here tryna raise my status up
But success bring bitches, and they bad as fuck
Ass fat as fuck, with a little ol' waist
I ain't want the whole meal, just a little ol' taste
Should have looked both ways fore I crossed you
I guess I never thought I could have ever have lost you
Now I'm out stuntin' with this bitch, who ain't about nothin'
While some nigga learnin' all the shit I taught you
Damn, guess you deserve that, a new start
But deep down you know we grew apart, long before I broke your heart
If I lost your respect, I'm just hopin' you don't look at me as you somethin' you regret
I got your message I been meanin' to respond, know it's been a while
Apologies, I ain't been around
I wanna kick it, but I know that shit is different now
And times have changed
Let me know if I'm out of bounds, are the lines the same ?
I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it
Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel about it
Now we can say that all good things come to an end
But we know each other way too well to pretend
We went from friends to somethin' much more
To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more
Second chances, we gave enough
'Til finally we gave it up, but some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more
But what for? Maybe it's just the weather
We break each others heart's, so maybe it's for the better
Holler whenever, cause you always got a friend in me
And nothin' lasts forever, least we got these memories
Uh, I got a laundry list of the sh** you done did for me
God, pulled out a rib for me
She pushed out a kid for me
When I'm gone, you hold down the crib for me
You know you wouldn't last in no prison
You told me straight up you ain't doin' no bid for me, uh
The Lord, He blessed you with common sense
Too many good b****** behind the fence
For lyin' to feds for n***** that climb in bed with thotties
If I ever catch me a body, I'll make you a promise, you won't know about it
I can't get you caught up in messes I made
Love you forever
When we turn like 50, I'm still gonna have all of your messages saved
Purple emojis with horns on it
Like the devil, but ain't nothin' devilish, babe
In fact, it's a Heaven-sent thing
Black angel with the regular name
F*** strangers, I could never contain my passion for you
I'm grabbin' on you in public, I know that you love it
I'm tryna put one more lil' boy in your stomach
No frontin', I keep it one hunnit
If you was to leave me, I know I'm gon' plummet
I know I'm gon' plummet
Look, ready for whatever comes
I hope for the best, I taste the peace and pray it never leave my tongue
But yet, before long, the feelings done
Perhaps I was foolish, just like the boy that prays to only see the sun
Maybe, life happens like tides
One minute you're low and feelin' shallow, then all of a sudden you rise
Just, ride the wave, I say to myself
Find a way, the weight of my wealth
It's honestly a lot to bear
I play the game of stackin' knowin' that I ought to share
How much does a man need? How much can he hoard before his greed?
How can a rich father teach humbleness to his seed?
Just questions, the stubborn all get taught tough lessons
I look at all I got like, "What's missin'?"
God is my only guess, 'cause yes, faith relieve the stress
I find peace again when I find Him and see I'm blessed
Real blessed, life has always got me wonderin'
(Wondering, wondering) Am I doin' it right?
Am I hurtin' myself?
Am I wrongin' the ones that love me the most?
What a burden to have
That ain't no way to live
Or maybe it is
Well, maybe it is
Who dat, who dat?
Hey, who dat, who dat? That nigga you been waiting for
I mean the shit was all bad just a week ago
Rappers was bullshitting, fuck it I ain't hating though
Because now a nigga hot enough to fuck with one of Satan' hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through hell conditions
Wishing for air conditioning, feeling God was never listening
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy you failed the mission
Speaking of positions just witness how I elevate it
Real niggas celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated, but had to wait my turn
Then I redecorated, that mean my tables turned
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Is try and fail, clientele the only way to earn
So if you're selling crack, or if you're selling rap
Make sure it's mean so them fiends keep on coming back
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfucking name
I got them saying who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat? I got them saying
Who dat, who dat? Cole World
Hey, the mind state of a winner
When you thinking about summertime I'm thinking about the winter
When you thinking about breakfast I'm heating up my dinner
I was plotting this moment back when y'all was riding spinners
Yeah I'm a menace, God as my witness, with this pen I'm insane, yup
Hungry like the nigga who ain't got the taste of fame yet
Clown told me, “Ain't you Roc? But where the fuck your chain at?”
Guess it's something like your girl, nigga it ain't came yet
The man make the chain, chain don't make the man
How many niggas do we know with hella ice but yet they lame?
The cloth from which we came me and them is not the same
It's like we all headed to Spain they took the boat I took the plane, damn
That boy's sick now hoes on his joystick
Heating up like May weather, dog I'm on that Floyd shit
Boy stick to your day job, said you was hot? Well, they lied
Is that your girl? Well, I just G'd her, no A-Rod
The little engine that could, this little nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick, I heal niggas for good
A couple of y'all ain't took a field trip to the hood
And me? I'm fresh prince, I'm Will Smith to the hood
Baby, ain't saying names but we not the same
All the money and the fame don't change the fact that you lame
Might want to grab you a chain, want to tip up your hat
Might want to purchase some game, homey your shit is so wack
I got my finger on the trigger, tell that nigga, “hold that”
Want picture perfect baby you can check the Kodak
Hey, so anything you can do I can do better
And any chick you can screw I can get wetter
I'm young, black, gifted, live my life on the run
Bet your bottom dollar before I'm done
They say that I'm the one, ya nigga I'm the one
I got them saying
Hey I got a dolla and a dream
It's all a nigga got so its about that green
And I'm all up in that spot
Yeah the mental state of a young black genius conflicted
The fast life I done seen on the screen is addictive
Money and clothes I done dreamed about
And all the hoes that I fiend about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material shit I never had?
Waving gats instead of flags, the American Dream
Why do we cling to the villains?
Knowing they kill 'em
My niggas high enough to swing from the ceiling
Ink from the pen spilling on my notebook
Filled with dreams, this is my hope book
Still the screams from little girls shot and killed fill my head on the daily
At times I question God can you blame me? They can’t tame me!
My voice screech through the street..I'm a beast on em!
Oh no he will not fold, you will not see a crease on him!
He will not slip or lose his grip, they got them cleats on him!
But never will he run unless you call police on him
One time, two times, three times
Sometimes I scrap sometimes Im throwin up the peace sign
Its two sides to a nigga though
I said Its two sides to a nigga yo
Ay look sometimes I'm feeling high
Then I'm feeling low
Lord will I die will I survive let a nigga know
You say you know me but what side did you get to know?
Its two sides to a nigga yo yo yo
Yeah some pussy niggas pulled out on me and my mans
Wasn’t for the pistol we drop em right where he stands
But still we never ran, foolish pride made us stand right there
Not understanding we could lose our life there
And then it hit us, thinking bout the close calls from long distance
Ugh as lil niggas in the Ville we was trippin
Type of nosy ass niggas to watching the fight until its over
They ran when the gats came out, I moved closer
Foolish what was I thinking? wasn’t trying to be cool, its
Just the thrill of the danger get so filled up with anger
When a stranger get to violating
He sleeping on me wide awake, bitch I'll annihilate him
I'm tired of waiting on my ticket out this mothafucka
Hope they don’t kill me before I get up out this mothafucka
I gotta go
Now can I be that nigga I thought I was? I gotta know
Will I make it like I thought I would? I gotta blow
Yeah I seen heaven, seen hell
The two faces of the Ville
One side dreams, the other sides real
One side schemes, the other side deals
What the pain brings another mother cry still
Why the fuck am I here God?
That nigga died why the fuck am I still alive?
I feel ashamed cause the good Lord done brought all this success to me
And all I seem to focus on is all this stress on me
Bless homie we breathin
Cold world got me sneezing
Wrote this when I was broke so hey I guess we even
Throwin' blows fighting demons trying to stop from bustin semen
In an unfamiliar bitch I know my niggas feel this shit
How could I fuck her raw? And I just met the ho
My dick took over it ain't never felt this wet before
Im stressing in my mind but its way to late to stop it
Make this shit so bad, I had a condom in my pocket
Lets change the topic
Before I go berserk
I’m so alert, riding down 95
Naw I ain't finna to go to work
I’m headed back home ain't staying that long
I’m chasing dreams shawty im paying back loans
I’m paying dues that a nigga paying tax on
Im tryna blow like a nigga playing saxophone
I'm playing daddy to another niggas daughter
Don’t worry even Jesus never saw his real father
It don’t bother me at all though
Yeah say it don’t bother me at all
They got me thinking bout my mom though
Man I can't wait to sing this song I be like, I be like
Hey don’t cry hey ohh no
We ain't gotta worry bout the money no more
We ain't gotta worry bout how them bill get paid
We ain't gotta worry how the meals get fed
Hey Hey Hey
Hey, her mind is on a different level
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel
Hit the club, watch out boy, you dancin' with the devil
She fuck, she suck, she swallow, man, it's like a triple double
Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble
Just because they fuck ya girl don't mean them niggas love ya
She said, "Don't preach to me nigga, hold up
Is that a bottle on your table, well if so then pour it up"
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said, "Daddy, what you think?", "Little girl, you're growin' up
Growin up"
Hey, take a couple of shots and it's on
She said "Daddy what you think?" "little girl, you're growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song
Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
Can I get a witness, this is Sade mixed with Shawty Lo
Ey, Jezebel, why you be up in every party for?
You lost to lookin' for a savior, I ain't Mario
I got no cape, but I can't wait to give you cardio
Work you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter though
Make me wonder where your father go?
She said, "Don't analyze me, nigga, hold up
Is that green on your table? Well if so, then roll it up
I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy, what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, and blow a couple sacks and she gone
Said, "I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said, "Daddy what you think?" "Little girl you growin' up"
Hey, listen, baby girl, they playin' your song
Tick
This is for my niggas in the fourth quarter
Just watching that clock tick. Yeah
You said, "at what point do you start seeing bread?
Been out hustling for years, shoe box right under my bed
I move the work out my momma’s house, got me a little old crib
I always fantasize if I had went to college instead
Would I be happily married instead of broke and unwed?
My nigga made a major move I said I hope for the best
I told my sister as I kissed her cheek I’m better off dead
Fucking with this white, it’s all been downhill like a sled
Now listen, I understand they say you make your own bed
But tell me who supplied these sheets with this cheap ass thread
In denial about the feds, he can’t see past bread
Now do exactly what the man in the ski mask says, okay?
These are the times, survival my only crime
I gotta be on my grind, a lot of my homies gone
Inside of me Lord I know, it’s a lie that we gon' be fine
But momma I’m tired of crying, just lie to me one more time"
Cause it’s crunch time
Shit real man
A nigga got bills man it’s crunch time
Shit real man a nigga got bills
Looking for strength in the crunch time
This shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg
It’s crunch time, yeah nigga it’s crunch time
I feel your pain nigga trust me
For all my nigga’s out there still trying to get it
Few nigga’s I know, few nigga’s I don’t know
Shout out to my nigga FilthE
Nervous Reck
Shout out to Marcus
My nigga I forgive you for all that shit you said
I understand my nigga
Still love. Yeah
Poverty's paradise
If you want it, you'd better think twice
Hey, no love, no love
How you gon' survive now? No love, no love
Yo Gotti, lemme paint a picture for these niggas, hey, huh
Here’s a, voice for the voiceless
My words like, multiple choice to the choiceless
Emerge like, a searchlight in the darkness for this young black carcass
My niggas either join the Armed Forces or they corpses now
In God we trust, but it’s bucks that we worship now
Boy, that root of evil gon’ forever rule the people
See I seen just what that fast money gon’ come and do to people
Hit a lick, it was a hit, he said, “Let's go and do the sequel”
But his, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it now
Feeling guilty, what would momma think about me?
Told 'em, "Think about it, nigga, won't you think about it now?"
But he was money hungry, plus he trigger happy
So they hopped up in the Caddy, burners packed just like a stadium
Thirty minutes later, blood is leaking at the ATM
Momma in denial like her baby boy on trial
For a murder that he ain’t commit, tears soak the handkerchief
They say the good die young, that’s the truth
My nigga floating up in Heaven now and that’s the proof
I ain’t make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace
If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me
Nigga, maybe we can fly someday
Oh, we can fly someday
Yeah, up in the sky someday, mm
Do real niggas get to Heaven? That’s that shit I ask the reverend
Nigga, maybe we can fly someday (fly)
Oh, we can fly someday (fly)
Yeah, up in the sky someday (sky)
And it don't take no X-Ray to see right through my smile
Every time I step outside I see my people die
Forget this chain, cause this ain't me
Though I'm eternally grateful to Jay Z
We so elated, we celebrated like Obama waited until his last day in office to tell the nation, brothers is getting their reparations, hey
A man can dream, can't he?
No disrespect, in terms of change I haven't seen any
Maybe he had good intentions but was stifled by the system
And was sad to learn that he actually couldn't bring any
That's what I get for thinking, this world is fair
They let a brother steer the ship
And never told him that the ship was sinkin'
But I got other shit to think about, like my bank account
Forget that watch, you paid too much for it
You 'ought to be ashamed
When brothers back home be dreading when the seasons change
Cause they ain't got no heat and they ain't got no AC
WalMart distribution fired my homie, he just had a baby
You wonder why it's been so many B and E's lately
While brothers from the hood shooting like this is TNT lately
And since all the ballers leaving college early
I turn on the TV and don't see no brothers with degrees lately
All we wanna do is take the chains off...
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, uh
Now I was dreaming 'bout a deal at the age of thirteen
I was fiending for the mills, I ain't talking Burger King
Some of my niggas in the Ville, all they did was serve fiends
Fuck scales, I had skills, all day rehearsing
Them pretty boys had them gals, spent they time flirting
All they wanted was some waves like they fucking surfing
Hold up now, don’t get it twisted, I ain't hating, do your thing
I was like a young Simba; couldn’t wait to be the king
Now a nigga is the prince
Hopped over the fence where the grass way greener
Look at shorty ass, way meaner
Something like Serena mixed with Trina, have you seen her?
She fine enough to be Ms. Howard, word to Adina
My money like a senior, watch it graduate
Now it's time to eat, I’m letting all my niggas grab a plate
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies
These niggas heard about me, now they acting like they know me
Keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” (Shit)
It ain't no telling (Huh, yeah)
“Ay, where you going, nigga?” (Hey)
It ain't no telling (Yeah)
They keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” (Going, nigga, ay)
Can’t tell you where I’m going, just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the top, uh
Pardon the interruption, a proper introduction is necessary
When your shit is legendary, man
Greedy niggas wouldn’t let me in the cafeteria'n
'Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian
The hoes is librarians; they looking me up
She got to Jones like Marion, she licking me up
Then we cut, look how she say my name
I got her moaning "J. Cole", they used to say Jermaine
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin; six feet, shit's deep
I was low, just a dollar and some hope fixed me
'Cause I was broke, plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser
Lord, please let my problems disappear like Ron Mercer
I’m a star; Converses
Conversin' with them girls with them curves like cursive
They open like curtains
'Cause my shit is unheard of like curses on the radio
Same bitches used to play me though, now they yelling—
“Where you going, nigga?” (Shit)
“Ay, where you going, nigga?” (Shit)
They keep on saying “Where you going, nigga?” (Going, nigga)
I can’t tell you where I’m going, just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the top, yeah
Yeah, I left the city for a minute, but it's still on my back
Told my niggas "Ay, I'm finna put the Ville on the map
I'll be back, and I'm coming with a deal and a plaque."
'Cause I'm ill, bitch, they couldn’t make a pill for the rap
Pouring liquor for my niggas that was killed, send 'em back
Came home, shit is real, niggas still in the trap
Hold up now, don’t get it twisted, if you slang, do your thing
Me, I'm like a young Simba; I can't wait to be the king
Witness the dream
Straight out that Carolina water, I was brought up
In the city where the skinny niggas tryna be the ballers
Ain't no fathers, but the skinny niggas tryna hit they daughters
Sneaking in her crib, but her momma never caught us
What they taught us?
Man, them bad bitches only want the ballers, the starters
We hooping, now the hoes wanna guard us
Uh, okay, so play D—know what I mean?
And I, I, I'll put you on the team
Man, this life is but a dream and I need a fast car
Bad broads, fast forward; passport
I'm a fucking rap star
They say this life is but a dream, well I need a fast car
“Ay, where you going, nigga?” (Yeah)
It ain't no telling
Baptized at First Baptist Church
The pastor name was Reverend Johnson (Okay)
Chastised his shirt and matchin' shoes
But had to front, it never bothered him (Okay)
Hurt his pride but he swallowed it (Okay)
Dirt is all that he spotted
And in the dirty south where bodies pilin' up
So high, they block the birds and rerouted 'em (Damn)
Plenty murderers had observers but
You never heard a peep out of them
So many funerals it ain't enough numerals to keep count of them (Woah)
Look, I'm just settin' the scene
Back when I stared at the phone as I'm lettin' it ring
Another collector, they leave us a message
My mama in deficit, must intervene
I bust out the seams, I'm gettin' too big for these britches now
I invest in the dream, I'm destined for green
I got superstar dick for these bitches now
And I think about that when I dig 'em out
(When I dig 'em out, when I dig 'em out)
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker
Ayy, all you broke niggas be quiet
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk, motherfucker (2 Chainz)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker (Yeah!)
Chris Tucker, money talk motherfucker
Pyrex Whippa
Niggas want smoke, mmh
Niggas want smoke, I want it too, mmh
Niggas want, mmh, niggas want, mmh
CHASETHEMONEY, CHASETHEMONEY
Mmh, niggas want smoke, I want it too
Roses are red, my diamonds are blue
Pockets is green, a permanent hue
My niggas get work like assignments is due
Just made a mil', I counted it once
I think I go spread it around in the slums
2-6 god, that's where I'm from
Help me get used to the sound of the drum
Rolls Royce riding down Sunset
I must get a crib in LA
Fuck a nigga finna tell me?
Catch him slippin', Cinderell-ayy
Big ass chopper make God flinch
Ducking from the boys in the field
Just as good as poison with the steel
Hesitation always get you killed, nigga
I wanna pop my shit
I wanna cop my whip in cash
On that note, pull up on them folks
In an all black Ghost like Christmas Past
Vicious ass
Low-key rich with the same outfit that I did just have
Pardon the smoke, that's just my staff
Quik Stop, never seen this much gas, nigga
I got a story to tell you to speak for the niggas that never could speak for theyself
I was off Cumberland Road when a couple of niggas mistook me for somebody else
I put the pedal to metal when I seen the muzzle, I couldn't help but think to myself
Boy, keep your ass in the house, the city is bad for your health
(Aheee, ahee-iya-iya-iya-eee-e)
(Aheee-e)
(Aheee-e-e)
(Yeee-hee, Ahee-e-e)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Aheee-ahe-e)
(Aheee-e-e) Up up and away, hey, do you trust me?
Would you love me, then it must be
Worldwide stunner, oh man, I'm a
Reign on the game, make it storm and thunder
Grab an umbrella bitch, and go stand under
And bundle up, it's gonna be a cold ass summer
Uh, you niggas so last summer
On to the new, on-on to the new shit
Jigga wouldn't even take my CD when he seen me
Two years later bitch we made it on, on to the Blueprint
Now how's that for persistence?
Cole World comin', call back up assistance
Same broads used to hang up on my walls
Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress
Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned
Now I know I ain't the richest, but I still wanna ball
Put money over bitches, but we still underdogs
Did you miss me? No I don't know where I'm goin'
But I'm goin', now is you comin' with me (With me, with me)?
Up, up and away (And away, and away)
Hey, do you trust me (Trust me, trust me)?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me (Love me, love me)?
Then it must be (Must be, must be) a match made in heaven (Heaven, heaven)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
God's Gift, (Get up, get up, get up)
God's Gift, (Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
Mothafucker this is God’s gift
Pussy my passion
Man I just can’t help it I see a cookie, I grab one
Lookin' for some nookie, I’m tryna scoop me a bad one
Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one
Ever since I got on
I’ve been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on
Ex-cheerleader, hollerin' what’s up
Now her nigga beat her, now that’s fucked up
What type of little fuck boy hit a
Woman, bet he wouldn’t put his hands on a nigga
Ha, I ain’t bitter boy that’s all you
Ha, plus I just fucked her fore she called you
Ha, dry your eyes baby, I’ll drive you home
Older hoes sayin' "My how you’ve grown"
I came up, fucked the game up
Show my momma I’ll survive on my own
Did you miss me? I don't know where I'm goin'
Miss high profile caught you shopping on Canal
I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style
Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile
Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows
It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?
Your make up like a mask, tryna hide yourself
It seems on the outside, you thinking you the shit
But there's a soul that's inside that you don't even knew exist
So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you
Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you
Hoping this will reach you when you understand
That your value ain't determined by another man
'Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand
And you just tell them "go deep" like Cunningham
And you just let them OD like Len Bias
And that pussy so good he let his friends try it
Losing your balance, yea uh
Losing your balance
Girl you losing your balance uh, yea
Don't slip, don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga, hold on
Don't lose your balance
I look around at my city, this is SinVille
That boy eleven-years-old and can inhale
Sometimes I ride around wondering if we in hell
Or why do cops love to throw a nigga in jail
I'm bout to lose it, I just had another friend killed (damn)
Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill
I had a convo with my soul I asked it "When will, this shit change? "
It said boy "Just use them pen skills"
And so I write this for my niggas on the corner
Love you 'cause you my brother, so I feel I got to warn ya
This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance
On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands
Damn, better get yourself some goals, you niggas better dream
I know the hood raised you but it's bigger better things
And for those that passed, I need a moment of silence
Sssssshhhhh
Yeah, and don't be losing your balance
Don't be losing your balance
My nigga, don't be losing your balance
Don't slip don't fall
Just a get a grip my nigga hold on
I got a thing for this little mama
She do it to me plus her brain is forreal, I'mma sucka for love I guess
Won't catch her up in the club cause she ain't into that
Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate
Say she never fuck with thug niggas only gentlemen
And yea that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect
Other men would sweat her when we walk past
Can't even blame em' did the same when I saw the ass
Match with the thin waist, brown with a slim face
Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensei
Now she got me chillin' with her all around the clock
My homies beefin cause I never come around a lot
Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same
And ever since she came around I never want to hang
They tell me that it's foul how a chick can make me switch
But man I can't help it dawg, her mind got me whipped
I think I'm losing my balance, yea uh
She got me Losing your balance
She got me Losing your balance uh, yea
But I won't slip, I won't fall
Just a get a grip and hold on
Losing my balance
언제나 멀기만 했었던 신기루가 눈 앞에 있어 (여기 있어)
그래도 너무 행복해 I'm good
삼년 전 첫무대의 마음을 다시 검문해
여전히 대구 촌놈 랩퍼와 다를게 없었지 but
아마추어란 단어 위에 프로란 단어를 덧 썼지
그토록 원하던 무대 랩을 하며 춤 출때
아직 살아 있음을 느껴 피곤하고 고된 출퇴근
따위는 견딜만해 내사람들이 지켜보니까
몸이 아파도 버틸만해 함성들이 밀려 오니까
데뷔 전후의 차의점 아이돌과 랩퍼 사이 경계에
살아도 여전히 내 공책엔 라임이 차있어
대기실과 무대 사이에선 펜을 들고 가사를 써
이런 내가 니들 눈에는 뭐가 달라졌어?
Damn shit 난 여전해
내가 변했다고? (what?) 가서 전해
변함없이 본질을 지켜 I'm still rapperman
3년전과 다름없이 랩하고 노래해 I'm out
펜과 책만 알던 애가 이제 세상을 놀래킨다는게 I dunno
세상의 기대치와 너무 비대칭 할까봐 두려웠어
나를 믿어줬던 모든 사람들을 배신하게 될까봐
무건운 어께를 펴고 첫 무대에 올라
차나의 짧은 정적 숨을 골라
내가 지켜봤던 사람들이 이젠 날 지켜보고 있네
항상 올려봤던 TV속 그들이 지금은 내 밑에
Uh 주마등처럼 스칠 틈도 없이 한번뿐인 연극은 시작 돼버렸지
3번만에 증발한 내 3년의 피땀 피터지는 마이크와의 기싸움
몇십초일 뿐이었지만 똑똑히 쏟아내 I'm fucking real
야임마 니 꿈은 뭐야 나는 랩스타가 되는 거야 can't you feel
그리고 내려온 순간 그 함성 yeah I could read your mind (uh yeah)
I could read your mind 물음표 내신 미소만
말없이 멤버들은 그저 내 어깨를 두드렸줬어
꼭 엊그제같은데 스무 밤이 흘러가 버렸어
And let the haters hate on me 걔네가 늘상 해온 일
니네가 키보드 놀릴동안 난 내 꿈들을 채웠지
썬글라스 hairstyle 뭘 욕하는지 알아
어쨌든 스무살에 너보다 잘나가는 나야
3년이란 시간 모두 하나가 됐던 마음
그렇게 흘린 피땀이 날 적시네
무대가 끝난 뒤 눈물이 번지네
매순간 마다 자신에게 다짐해 초심을 잃지 않게
한상 나답게 처음의 나에게 부끄럽지 않게
So we go we go we go

English Translation
Hey, to the college kids, no scholarships
Starting your semester
Unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser
Enjoy it while you got it, after that it’s God bless ya
Life is your professor, know that bitch is gon' test ya
I got some shit I’d like to get off my chest
I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress
And can I spit out my stress?
It’s the feeling in the air you bout to drop a real classic
He said, "Cole, a lil' birdy told me on the low you got an Illmatic”
Nobody touching Nas, nigga it’s more like Villematic
These Fayettenam tales be paying off well
What story is my audio theater gon' tell
I know my debut will ship, but is it gon' sell?
I guess it’s in God’s hands
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say, "God damn"
That's for your non-believers
I’m the truth only time will teach ya
And fuck the haters, probably never love they mamas neither
Old bitter-ass sit around in middle class homes
With computers on hatin' on the newest song
While you was browsin', I was takin' out them student loans
Trying to do this shit better than the niggas we grew up on
Name a fuckin' song I ain't threw up on
Talk is cheap, it's like y'all grew up in a Jewish home
Pardon the stereotype
But y'all giving me mixed feelings like I married a white woman
One minute I’m overrated, next minute I’m the savior
You hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya
For bullshitting and that nigga Cole spitting that real
Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville
To Miami, where the same time last year
I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear
Cause now I’m dealing with money I’ve never seen before
And R&B bitches want me, that was just dreams before
Now do I give into the temptation I’m facing
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasing
But I’m just a man, at time’s the timing is wrong
Plus my dick is like a man with a mind of it’s own
But I’m trying to be strong, remind myself she ain’t about shit
These hoes the same, all that change is the outfit
Looking for cheese on some mouse shit
Suck a nigga, fuck a nigga, then go run they mouth quick
Rappers took a vacation I came over to house sit
You want change, this that between the seats in your couch shit
The fuck you thought, I lost it
All that flame on my name would get exhausted
Au contraire my nigga they all ears
Sit back, enjoy the ride it’s finna be a long year, yeah
It’s finna be a long year, yeah
I know you feel that, the tingle in your spine don’t conceal that
Don’t conceal that
This exactly what you thought
Somebody bought the real back
Okay, I lied
Uh-huh
Motherfuckers tryna say I can't come to the hood—true lie
See, I would, but I'm out in Dubai
When I get back I'ma roll through that
Snatch yo' bitch, give yo' niggas dap
The hood gon' ballistic
Cole was here and you missed it
That nigga walk like Obama man
Shook yo momma hand and then kissed it
This pimp shit, this pimp shit
Cole hard, you limp dick
My flow hard, no wimp shit
Put in that work, no temp shit
Ya bitch wearin' that lipstick
Gave this dick a french kiss
That nigga so wack when the bitch came back
He kissed her hoping that it get him sick, ha
Ain't that some shit
Well paid for this rapping shit
Ville made it to the map and shit
Niggas move 'caine like Kappa shit
Can't map this shit
From no bed springs in my mattresses
To fuckin' these bad little actresses
I'm bad as shit, ha
I got that work
Say what? My flow
Say what? My bitches
Say what? You Cole
Say what? I said
Say what?
Well paid for this rap and shit
Ain't that some shit, bitch
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
(Bounce) bounce
Flow, flow, flow, flow
Flow tight, put a nigga in a headlock
Fuck hoes out of wedlock, make her bed rock
Red hot, so they got red dots
Pullin' that trigger nigga better be a head shot
Money long like dread locks shit
So if you send shots then you bet not miss
For a couple G's, send a couple G's
Fuck copping pleas, Met Lock shit (testify)
I gotta testify
Came through humble so it's best if I
Explain the newer shit, rockin' jewel shit
Got the full clip, cock and pull shit
Stop the bullshit watch the flow
How you gon' stop the unstoppable?
Keep niggas on they toes, no Dr. Scholls
It's the Roc bitch, rock and roll
My nigga Syience killed this motherfucking beat
Hey, hey, hey, lil’ Craig, come here. Aye, hit this, nigga. Nigga, don’t worry ’bout what the fuck it is, just drink!
Yeah yeah, yeah
Some of my better times, I shared with you
I shared with you, yeah
Shit, all of my better days, I shared with you
I shared with you, shit
And now I gotta wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Shit, stuck inside a rat race (fuck)
Rat race (fuck, fuck)
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up again
Stuck inside this rat race (fuck)
Twist the cap, lift the bottle back, swig it
Dig it, ten-inch rims on my mama’s Civic
Ten-inch woofers in the trunk, to be specific
They bump, rattle the license plate, plus the windows tinted
Don’t even give a fuck that it’s dented, bitch, I’m the man now
I’m rolling, driving it slow as if it’s stolen
Piling up bros like we was clothing on a dresser
Calling up hoes like we was Jodeci, let’s check her
Double D’s like double-deckers, I wanna sex her
But these keys don’t come with game on how to finesse her
Five semesters left until college, I’m under pressure
I’m not a real nigga ’til I undress her, I gotta ‘press her
This was my main concern back when concerns were lesser
Nowadays, I often yearn to press the
Backspace button or hit return but life is not no word processor
Most folks would burn the sess to burn the stress of
My real-life trauma plus fickle niggas thinking they done heard the best of
Jermaine Lamarr but that’s insane, it couldn’t be further left of
The truth is that my new shit slap, you never heard it better
Give me a sec, I murder sectors, prefer to let ya
See it rather than say it, but it spill out, I gotta chill out
Say “Fuck the world” and never pull out
We had no Boblo boat but I could note
Those times is like a Bible quote
BC, before cell phones, the first time I would smoke
I was six years old, but that’s for another chapter
That’s for another story, to God be the glory
I made it out unscathed and now I sunbathe
With my son in Tanzanian sunrays thinking ’bout dumb days
Thinking ’bout dumb days
This is; 808-Ray
Nigga don't worry about what the fuck it is, just drink
Yeah, what's up girl?
Angel eyes, long hair, I see you cryin', what's wrong there
"He did what? He fucked who?", we know the story, what's new?
See I could probably rush you, tell you that he shoulda loved you
Take advantage, fuck you, tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do
But the truth is, we all the same, on different teams, but it's all a game
The objective, tryna score, you got a wife, you find a whore
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers, pull up her pants, you find the door
You drive her home, she mop you off, you bust again, and drop her off
Then repeat like an episode; why we cheat, I'll never know
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no, lotta niggas rap though, never blow
Like heterosexuals, girl you fine, from head to toe
Could it be cause my father let me know that he cheated and somehow
I never told, I never told
Father: Hey you wanna be a man?
Son: Yeah I wanna be a man
Father: A man don't run and tell his mama everything he see
Son: I ain't gon' tell
Father: Alright, alright then man, be a man then
Son: Alright
Ok, that's what it is, I see the game, the hoes come, the seasons change
The hoes go, we rearrange, fuck up her life, she'll never be the same
The OG's that beat the game, forever young, Peter Pan
35? Still playing; Child support? Still paying
Juggling, bill paying, been running round, field daying
Wine and dine, meal paying, with hopes that she'll lay in
The bed and, get wet then, give head then, you bet man
The same girl who said we just met man, game colder than the fucking dead man
One night stands, no best man, no bridesmaids or Reverends
Cause Wolverine's depressed and don't wanna be your ex-man
Cause Cupid aims and throw the darts, there go the sparks and broken hearts
Who wanna build Noah's Ark just to have that shit torn apart?
Wife: You know what? I need to talk to you
Husband: About what?
Wife: I don’t think this is, working out for us
Husband: Why?
Wife: I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that’s all
Husband: What the fuck?!”
Wife: You know?
Hey one time, hey one time, one time
Throw your hands to the sky tonight
'Cause I think I see the baddest lil thing in the world right now
But I gotta make sure I’m right
And girl you damn right
If your head right, I’ll be there every night
I just might change your life
'Cause baby you got it (you got it), you got it (you got it)
You got it (you got it), you got it (you got it)
Hey Cole World, real cold world
I watch it hit the floor and watch it drop it real low girl
Last time I seen you, you was a lil old girl
I had a crush now we grown and you still so thorough
Clap for her, work it till you exhausted
I swear ain't nothing worse than a bad bitch that lost it
Brains off the chain, smart mouth with a dumb ass
Goddamn your ex-man is a dumb ass
When you was leaving, did he put up a fight?
Was he stressing you, wasn’t fucking you right?
Well one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
One man’s pain is another man’s pleasure
One damn thing you can’t change is the weather
But even if it rain, we get rained on together
It’s whatever, you shine, I shine
I know you got a 9 to 5 I’ll be your 5 to 9
And girl you dead right
Yeah, go ahead and pop it like you do in the mirror
I’m picking through the crowd tryna see a little clearer
High heel wearer, ugh, hell of a body
First one to spot you and I ain't telling nobody
Nope, I’m peeking at your ass, winking at your ass
If I don't bag I’ll be thinking bout your ass
For the whole week, no time for cold feet
She too bad to pass, so fine I'm gon' speak
I tell her my name Jermaine, I’m tryna be low key
She tell me I got that flame, your rhymes are so deep
Damn, girl thank you, shit, you so bad
Know your daddy wish he could still spank you, hol' up
'Fore these other niggas roll up and try get ya
The ones that say they riders but never do ride with ya
I’m tryna vibe witcha, so won't you throw me your phone number
And let them lames get your old number
You got it (you got it), you got it (you got it), hey
Higher, higher
(Revenge)
Now I could be the change that I wanna see
I can heal the world for real if a nigga speaking honestly
Nat Turner in my past life
Bob Marley in my last life, back again
Look in to the eyes of a young nigga
Who survived against all the odds
Look into the eyes of a young nigga
Who's surprised to be alive
I died 5 years ago, the game snatch a nigga’s spirit yo
My resurrection was a miracle
Cause still I rise, it's ill-advised to bet against him
Raised in hell but heaven sent 'em, let 'em diss 'em
Some niggas can't handle the truth
Some niggas don't know they're slaves
I forgive 'em cause I know their ways
They see a black man shine
First thing they do is throw their shade
Word?—errr—I swerve like a Thunderbird on the curb
Where the cops pursuing, I'm not just doing it
Niggas hate like if I make it ain't a spot for you in it
Have to save the rap game cause I watched them ruin it
So you can take my cock and chew on it
Cock sucker I'm a blockbuster
Motion picture, flows consist of potent scriptures
Known to rip a hole through them so-called dopest niggas
Snatch your soul and pose for pictures, holding it
Revenge of the Dreamers, so vindictive
Back for more, that whack shit's over with
For you niggas sleeping this is Folgers Crystals, wow
In the form of a loaded pistol
Bullets rude, they don't even say "Hello", just kiss you, blaow
Burn in hell with a coat that fits you
When you see the devil
You can tell him Cole just sent you now
Yeah, yeah—higher, higher
Yeah, yeah—higher
Now I can be around, shit, whenever you want
I can be around, shit, whenever you need
Fuck with a nigga, we can touch the stars
Trust in a nigga, you can count on me
I can come around, shit, whenever you want
I can come around, shit, whenever you need
Me, me, me, me, me, me
Check
How else I make it this far?
Listen, music my flesh and blood, it's been my only love since ye high
I used to play Jay high and Ye high
Thinkin' one day I would go from fan to fuckin' player
I guess I found a way huh, my nigga Cozz wants Zendaya
A side note, I'm rootin' for you, I use these bars and start recruitin' for you
But treat her right
And just remember, on your lonely nights this mic will be your friend
You tell it all your secrets that you keepin' deep within
Your fantasies, regrets, your happy moments and your sins
And if he doesn't comprehend, at least he can pretend
Let's begin to be the men we never seen
In the 80's they smoke crack but now today they sippin' lean
And poppin' Xannies
Fuck niggas runnin' from their families
The streets don't give a fuck about the Grammys
Wish I could talk to granny, wish I could smoke in peace
But when I hit the blunt lately my mind it tortures me
Everything ain't supposed to be, apparently
I take it as a sign and stick the shit that's steerin' me
In the direction of some clarity
This music is my therapy, I thank the Lord 'cause he care for me
You know I gotta thank God
How else I make it this far? (Far)
Yeah, Fayettenam
These niggas is playing
Russian Roulette with a full clip, foolish
My crew is foolless, no, we don't dance
All we do is stay two steps ahead
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck
Instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted, heavy traffic in this rap shit
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high, if I dropped I would fall for 11 minutes
So yeah, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train
It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name
It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these Jose Canseco's wanna text us like Waco
Its hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for?
Some next niggas almost slid in but didn't fit in
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kiddin?
These big wig niggas throwing their bid in
Try not to show stress, I guess the flow is protested like a sit in
I told my niggas we would get in
But that ain't even half the battle
Stay behind like a shadow or you catapult
Now if I had a ladder or now even if I had a rope
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!
Heaven or hell, you choose, freedom or jail, you lose
I can't stop, I'm as hot as the devils shoes
Overcame a low life status to blow like Gladys
Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards
I'm nothing like these ho-like rappers
My whole life practice to be the one
What's it like to be LeBron
They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it
The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it
Ill with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel
Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill
No Foreman, try not to call them ladies bees but them hoes swarmin
Now honey, aye is it destiny or is it money you're feelin
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself cause I asked for this
Headed for fame but in my brain, hey can I last in this?
Aye five years I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense
I keep it fresh while these wack niggas rehash and shit
Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit
I pass these niggas, they tryna do it how these other niggas did it
I'm tryna live it how no other nigga ever lived it
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighters
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
You might not be the one
Hey, uh
What up girl, tell me how you feelin’
You look sweet enough to make a nigga need a filling
If you got a man, do that nigga need a fill-in
She said looks kill and I’m tryin to make a killin’
And God willing, I’d be chilling on the boat nigga
Love is a gamble, I ain’t dealin’ with no broke nigga
Down in Miami, with a super ho team
Tryin’ to bag a brother with a Super Bowl ring
Down in Dallas at the All-Star game
Spittin’ All-Star game
Tryna get a nigga with a all-star name
Somethin’ like James, somethin like Wade
If you something like paid you can fuck tonight
Yeah she said fuck some nice J's
What about your life savings, won’t spend her life slavin’
So she graduated, rich nigga wife training
And if you got money man the head is amazing
What up girl, tell me how you been
Ain’t seen ya since the 12th grade, even back then
Thought you was a cutie, though your booty mad thin
But you done got thick on a nigga, god damn
Hey now got a thing for you
It's been a long time comin', I should hang with you
'Cause see way back, I thought to fuck with you was impossible
Count your baby daddy’s now, 2 and a possible
Uh, you still got it though, yeah you still got it though
Girl your body lookin’ like a fuckin’ pot of gold
You got your mean little walk with the model pose
You got your hair did, you got designer clothes
You still got it though, yeah you still got it though
You got your nails did, damn girl you're on a roll
Do you get brains, did you make the honor roll
Don’t worry bout your man baby, he ain’t gotta know
Hey, I get bored so fast that they won’t last
But girl you’re special like I met you in the slow class
Cause yo ass got me fiending for ya so far
My life is like a movie, would you be my co-star
Like Halle Berry? Your old nigga act like a bitch, like Tyler Perry
You caught him down in Memphis cheating like Calipari
I see you like to stay up on your ESPN
If your mind is on sex you must got ESP then
Had a crush on way back, I wasn’t VIP then
But I was plotting on you, I really wish that I'd have got to know you
Before we grew up and I blew up with these Benjamins
That way I know for sure your love is really genuine
Is you my homie? Well show me what kind of friend you is
What if it's phoney, yeah only 'cause I can give you ends
Too late for turning back, fuck it we continuing
Get your ass in that position, I love to bend you in
Grew up with killers, I ain't know they was killers
We was just together, man, playing Mega Man on Sega, man
Your mama loved me to death, she reminded me of Afeni
Yeah, a real black queen, if I had a genie
I'd wish that she ain't struggle no more
Y'all wouldn't have to go to sleep with all the roaches if she wasn't so poor
You told me when you came to my house this shit was like a timeout
From reality, one night you asked me what I'm crying 'bout
'Cause you was staying over for the weekend
I woke up from out my sleep when I heard mama and my stepfather beefin'
I don't know if he'd been drinkin', but I know this shit got loud
And I heard rumbling from struggling and rolling on the ground
Could never get used to that sound, my mama saying "Get off me!"
My tears is tumbling now, I wish that you never saw me, 'cause I
Felt like a coward, so powerless I was only 12
I wish I would'a bust through that door my fucking self
And grabbed the Glock right off the fucking shelf, if nothing else
Scared a nigga shitless, there goes two of my wishes
Forever scarred, determined to get some heart
No matter how big the nigga, no matter how small you are
Fast forward to our older years, two different paths
You used to talk to me 'bout college, but that shit didn't last
Wasted potential, getting cash, what could I say?
So tired of not having things, you'd never see it my way, too proud to fold
Your demise, one day much to my surprise
My nigga called me, told me you just caught a body twice your size
I asked if it was self-defense, he said it was defense of pride
And that they tryna give you ten, but if you lucky you'll do five, damn
Not my nigga, the same one that told me
That things always get better, just trust me, don't cry my nigga
The news call him a killer, but he my nigga
Sad shit, aye yo, genie last wish, free my nigga
Yeah, caged bird
Some'n' like a caged bird
Caged bird
You ain't a man till you stop chasing your friends, my nigga
Think for yourself, make your own plans, my nigga
I'll be lying if I said I ain't understand, my nigga
'Cause who you gon' follow when the leaders all get swallowed
By reefer clouds and bottles
In and out of county jail
This is hell, see the young black males in packed cells
With they heads down
And they fists clenched tight
Thinking, "I could bust a hole through this wall
And, bitch, I just might."
It's just like the caged bird; I sing a song
Hoping they open up these bars and send a nigga home
I cry when I'm alone
I'm wondering why would God send me here
Knowing that they hate us
Knowing that they make us feel like we evil so we kill our people
Without a second thought, in every lesson taught by OGs
We full of real nigga wisdom, so we proceed
Like real niggas who been stripped of our humanity
I see the judge's eyes, I know that he ain't understanding me
A caged bird (Yeah, a caged bird)
(Let this little caged bird sing) Caged bird
Freedom's just an illusion, that's my conclusion
And if it ain't, then how my niggas keep on losin' theirs?
This goes out to childhood friends that's doin' years
Prison tats on they backs like souvenirs
We wish that you was here
A mother's tear spilled on this page
A brother's tear spilled on this page
How many days left?
And can you find peace when you released
Still filled up wit' rage
Back on the streets just to peep that you still in the cage
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
Yeah, school girl, cool girl
You dressing sexy and your mama is a cougar
So she let you do the grown folks thang
Let you hang with them boys and they play you like a fool, girl
You got your new hair, it look so good
You write the same nigga's name in your notebook
You know the same one from class, the one you let smash
Now you see him 'round school and he won't look
Now girl you is fine, ain't no doubt about it
But why else you think he hit it and forgot about it?
It's cause your mind don't match what your ass got
But cheer up, you gotta be your own mascot
You see you're lookin' for a man like you need somebody
Get your ass off of Twitter, you could be somebody
A doctor, a rock star, baby live life
But you rather wet up all your pillows all night thinking...
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I...
Hey cheer up!
Ey lil' mama, cheer up!
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up?
Don’t let them lil' boy come but do some when they try push up
Yeah, I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
Don't even wanna get out the bed
I got the Glock to my head, feel I rather be dead
Hey, am I hopeless? Raised with rats and roaches
Never liked them teachers, couldn't stand my coaches
Ask "what's the matter?" but you can't relate
Living the life that you hate but you can't escape
Feel like I’m stuck here, that's why I don't give a fuck here
There's no luck here, nobody to trust here
My own mother, yeah I love her
But things I heard as a child under my covers
Left me with scars, it was hard to see her suffer
Darkened my heart and I don't know if I’ll recover
I'm going under and as I'm headed out the front door
She said she proud of me and I wonder what for?
And once more
Is this a dream? Well that's how it feel
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I'm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet a young Dennis, the menace to society
Check my sobriety, fuck hoes in varieties
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I'm getting dough man, these flows gon' retire me
Splurging all crazy
Switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy (Swerve)
Style on Nadal, I've been serving y'all lately, cheddar on Federer
Ball till I fall, et cetera, et cetera
Just turn the beat down just a little bit
They say anythings possible
You gotta dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits so we ain’t stopping for the red lights
Look in my rear view all I see is niggas headlights
Catch me if you can ho
They try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky you’ll see exactly where I am bo
Hey, don’t you see me man?
Making my wishes come true with no genie man
I got the keys to my beamer with no Beenie Man
I’m on these rich niggas ass no bikini man
I bring the real to the day the Lord free me man
Never imagined that the kids would wanna be me man
Eh, could it be that I give the hopeless broke kids, hope
Caught me walking through the mall, looking like he seen a ghost
Simply had to approach, "what's up young blood?"
Ain't it strange, a year ago today, my nigga, I was counting change
Yeah hopping trains up in New York city
Though I gotta thank God, cause if you weren’t with me
Then I surely woulda died, you can throw the fork in me
This my New Years resolution, dawg
No more Pork in me, uh, I ain't no Muslim though
Caron Butler I’m a wizard if ya doesn't know
Its young Simba, I’m ballin’ 'til the buzzer blow
You try and kick the shit I kick now you gon stub your toe
Boy thats just how tough I go, see this is my light work
This shit you callin' classic, I be like that might work
Want you to feel something new, that's how a dyke work
And ask me bout pressure, they wanna see my pipe burst
Not tonight nigga
Yeah, hey
Man, man, hey
Man, I rap so vicious but I talk so politely
Never met a baby momma, momma who don’t like me
Met a couple baby fathers though they wanna fight me
I hit her till she snooze, like the news nigga nightly
Send her back to you when she no longer excites me
Now she bitter with this nigga cause he ain't quite me
One things for certain babygirl, you are a wifey, two things for fucking sure
I am not the husband though, so run back to him while you still can
He sticking with his wife and kid, yeah thats a real man
I was ashamed all along and I still am
We let the lust interupt something real, damn
Girl we grown so you gotta play your own position
I wouldn’t say that you a ho, just made a ho decision
Eh, you can blame it on the liquor like a prohibition
We both know thats what you wanted girl
I know you listening
Girl, I know you listening
Uh, I know you listening
Hey, yeah
Shout out to the bootleggers who supply my shit
The fans online tryna find my shit
And to the niggas listening but won't buy my shit
And catch me in the street and wanna ride my dick
Y’all niggas is the worst, see me like
“J. Cole homie, can you sign my burnt CD”
Nigga please, an album ten dollars
You act like it’s ten g’s
This food for thought cost the same as 2 number three’s
So at ease with that broke shit
We all tryna get a dollar boy, no shit
You know I feel ya pain, therefore I slang this hope shit
And give you lines that you rewind and think oh shit
These rappers talk a lot of money, cars and hoes shit
I give you that and a whole lot more shit
That got richer and still rapping like I’m poor shit
You niggas think you know shit, man you don’t know shit
Ho bitch
Yeah, Cole Bitch
J Cole nigga
Tears for ODB, drug-induced poetry
What’s the use? Strung-out from that drug abuse, woe is me
80's baby, so I know my pops was gettin’ high
In the 90's, me and mama barely gettin’ by
2000's I was concentratin’ more on gettin’ fly
Gettin’ bitches, gettin’ rich to get the shit I couldn’t buy
You know the story, you know my allegory
I was sent from Heaven with a set of horns, they’d better warn y’all
I’m here for more than just to kick some witty metaphors, dawg
This more of the type of shit you spit to set a war off
‘Cause niggas be poor, get money and still don’t know
Why the fuck they can’t cop a house, the system meant to lock us out
But I’m knockin’ down the door, strapped up with a four-four
Robin Hood, shit and yeah, I’m ‘hood rich
That’s good enough to stay in new kicks and a good whip
Get good head from a good bitch, I give two shits, I’mma tell you straight up
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’mma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch, but I’m just tryna make it
They say life is what you make it, bitch
Lord have mercy on my soul, what I’ve done and what I’ve seen
My life has tumbled into that which only you could intervene
I put my heart in senseless things: money, bitches and street shit
Fascinated by beef, sad to say I won’t be shit
Grew up in this bitch without a pot to piss in, no toilet
How ironic, I took a lot of shit, like a bottom bitch
Or a model chick, high off coke
They lockin’ sons up for less, I don’t care how y’all cope
But yet I still peddle this dope and these pills
I’ll never know how sittin’ comfy on that Oprah seat feels
More than likely be on Most Wanted posters, we still
Holdin’ on to old dreams of bein’ Hova, be real
We the forgotten souls, bottom of the totem poles
Left for dead, some niggas fled, people said they sold their souls
I just think they found a better way, Lord knows I never pray
But sometimes I be wishin’ I could levitate, I’ll take it straight up
I go my way, you go yours
You taste real life, I taste tours (alright)
Sweet at first, but after a while
Too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
And I wear a frown now, 'cause I miss real
I miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
And you miss junk food, that’s why we work
You bring cooked food and I bring dessert
Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
The one swimming through my mind, that was always you
Our time together has inspired a song or two
Or three, or four, or more, mi amor
I’m sure, either you’re the one or I’m caught in the matrix
Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
Not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
Drunk off love we both feel deep down
But too scared to say cause we know how this ends
Thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
For the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
Butterflies like MJ, had to fit it in
My schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
Damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
The sun rising (already?) until the next time
I love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)
No sleep, no sleep
Oh that's your dream car? Nigga that's my old whip
Oh that's your dream girl? Nigga that's my old bitch
Oh that's your new flow? Nigga that's my old shit!
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas
Big nuts hangin', big bucks bringin', fuck ’em all
No slut shamin’, money in the Cayman, I'm appalled
Niggas swear they bangin’, feds got 'em singin' on the squad
Crack rock slangin' on blacktop pavement, tryna ball
Line ’em up on the wall, three deep, final call
Knee-deep, squeeze three, beep beep, Tylenol
Pulled up one deep, no squad, just me
Just God, no prob', real niggas tend to fuck with me
No jewelry, no stunt from me
Just a Bentley truck, and an empty cup of whatever that is
You too concerned 'bout how clever that is
Me, I'm concerned how much bread that it is
Or lettuce that is
I been got my mama out debt off of this
I'm fucking the game, you niggas is lame
You won't even get a little head out of this
Bet I'ma miss, you niggas is dense, my hits goin' over the fence
How is you niggas so rich? I'm not so convinced, my wrist costin' more than your whip
And I don't wear that no more, that shit there look tacky
Yeah, I'm the G.O.A.T., no nigga, don't at me
Put on your coat, the world gon' get colder
This is my year, don't say I ain't told you, nigga
Yeah, farewell
Hey, farewell
All my niggas farewell
Fayettenam
Look, some niggas let their dirt out some just keep it all in ‘em
So when a man dies all his secrets go with him
And fade; a part of history no longer known
Done did a lot of dirt I’ll bury with me when I’m gone
When my story’s told, how will they tell it?
Will they say I was a giver or remember I was selfish?
Will they say I was a sinner or pretend I was a saint?
Will I go down as a winner, what's the picture they gon' paint?
Wouldn’t say that I’m a quitter, that's one thing I know I ain't
Will they tarnish, will they taint? Glorify me, over-think?
Say they know me, say I’m great? Say I’m phoney, I was fake?
Say the things about me that they never told me to my face?
I was loved I was hated, just a nigga with a dream
I’m a liar, I was honest, I was all of these things
When I’m gone let em talk, they discussing who I am
When they bury me just know I wasn't nothing but a man
Wasn’t nothin’ but a man
This for them niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
Yeah, hey farewell
Yeh, hey farewell
This for niggas climbin’ heaven's stairwell
I pray you farewell
I bid you farewell
Yeah, hey, farewell
If I should die Lord this here is my will
Reincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville
Let me relive my younger days just once again
Reenact my memories from every friend to every sin
Keeping demons buried in my closet
But yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account
My eyes lit while I think about my childhood now I'm blanking out
Those were truly my best days
The only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid
Gradually turn into me stressin’ how the hell to get paid
Been making songs so long, now how the hell they get played
Ok, I’m blowing up quickly, I guess the flow is sickly
But yet I can’t forget my past and hope it won’t forget me
Got good grades but A's can’t stop strays so pray for me
Pour liquor for my niggas but hey, don’t wait for me
Cause I’m trying to cheat death, she out to bury my ass
You know the cliche “life's a bitch” well I’m gon marry that ass
And sign a pre-nup, think back to when we tore the skating rink up
Rapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club
Gave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls
Then we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the world
No sir, came a long way from having momma chauffer
It's hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure
But now we play the game, when it's over send me back
I swear I’m not gon change a thing
You can drop a “Wet Floor” sign down for the tears
God and my court date, the two things I fear
Man, they tryna give a nigga years
I’m tryna figure if I should even appear
Or should I skate town, catch a Greyhound
Change my name right, catch a plane flight
Out the country, let them ma’fuckas hunt me
Come and catch me if you want me
Know they’ll lock me if I stay
But where I’mma run to
I got a good girl, we got a son too
And all we went through, we ain’t see eye-to-eye
But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die
So if they give me one, or if they give me two
Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few
Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?
Would you find someone new or would you stay?
Like the hoes when they lay with me?
Puppy eyes when I go, sayin’ “stay with me”
Aw, girl, you bad as hell and yet I’d love to
But see I got a girl I’m really makin’ love to
Therefore I’m feelin’ a lot more guilty when I rub you
That’s why I skip all of that kissin’ when I fuck you
Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate
I had you, but you can’t have me, I never stay
Stay
Ha! Life in a hometown, ‘fore I could take a step
I’m gettin’ grown now
And startin’ to notice that I see the same hoes around
Guess they had to go ‘round, my raps is profound
I got the flows, but yet a nigga ain’t got no sound
Copped a beat machine, I’m cookin’ up my own now
Got my mind on the city where it goes down
See, if I’mma get to where I’m goin’ then I can’t stay
Although I love it here
I’ll be damned if I sit around another year
Dreamin’ dreams, hopin’ somehow that they just appear
The hardest part of leavin’ is to know my mother here
Oh, but I’m comin’ back – oh boy, believe that
Let’s show the little niggas, boy, you can achieve that
Got the city on my shoulders, piggy back
Hello, my name is Cole and I’m here to stay
La, la la la, la la la
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest, yeah
Hey, hey, you got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I’m about to blow up
Uh huh, say what
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Hey, I came up
I warmed up, the next up
Bitch I'm about to blow up
Now don’t it sound legendary
Live enough to resurrect the dead and buried
This for niggas who ain't satisfied with secondary
This for my sisters who ain't satisfied with secretary
Uh, I’m blowing up and bitch I’m still me
But what's the cost to live your dream, do you feel me?
Everything glittering ain't what you think it will be
Funny how money, chains and whips make me feel free
I’m starring in this bitch and yeah I write the show
Fuck the haters, I’m headed to the place you like to go
They say: "What you fighting for?"
The game is on life support
And Gary Coleman just passed: life is short
Look I’m about to blow up
Yeah, got to the club early just to get in free and wait for hoes to show up
But now its bottles at them tables, bring the models boy
I’m about to pour up
Uh ha, you know what
Right side, right side, uh huh
Hey, this is a song for my haters (Bitch I'm about to blow up)
Yeah, you got me feeling like the greatest, yeah (Ha, said I'm about to blow up)
Hey, this is a song for my haters (Uh huh, bitch I'm about to blow up)
Hey, hey, you got me feeling like the greatest, yeah
Mama said I should reconsider law school
That means I wear a suit and bend the truth and feel awful
Hell naw, got a degree, but what that cost you?
You make a good salary just to pay Sally Mae
That's real as ever
Ducking bill collectors like Jehovah’s witness
When they showed up at your door at Christmas
Was broke as dishes tryna let it go
Hit the club she drop it low
Lower than my credit score
Account overdraft what I got this debit for
So much debt it got me drinking, thinking "Bitch I better blow"
I better blow
These hoes ain't checking for no nigga with no vehicle
You border like Mexico
Hey baby girl, what it look like?
And where ya head at?
And what ya cook like?
She said "where ya bread at
And what your whip like?
You ain't got one or the other well brother good night"
Hey, this is a song for my haters (Look I'm about to blow up)
Praise God, it’s hard to stay spiritual
How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles
You mean to tell me everything goin be fine
If I call your hotline and pay $29.99 (shit)
Well damn, why ain't you say so?
Take this check and ask God to multiply all my pesos
And erase my number out the phones of these fake hoes
I saved her number just in case but now it’s case closed
To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter
You’ll never be me partner so it don’t fuckin' matter
You try to be and your career will see funerals
And be you, that's when it sounds beautiful
Then maybe you can blow up
And maybe you can blow up
Shit, but you know what?
For now, bitch I’m about to blow up
Diamonds (Diamonds), diamonds (Diamonds), yeah
Pick up the pen, write down the sins, cleanse
Lay that shit down, play it for friends
Make a few M's, then do it again
J. Cole, who'd have thought you woulda been rhymin' with ghosts
Guru flows forever like a diamond
The most could never afford the precious jewels
That's precisely why I'm blessin' you with clear-cut messages
I'm destined to invest in urban sections where depression rules
I hope to heal the destitute before I leave this vestibule
Between the heavens and the seven circles
Where some dead homies maybe rest, I plan to resurrect a few
I press the truth against the neck of devils
Look at the youth just like a precious pebble
Meant to be protected, mentally we let this
Poison of Western philosophy make us sloppy
We forgot we are the chosen
From hip-hop to astronomy, they copy what we showed 'em
Niggas be talkin' slick, but only try me over modems
In person they starstruck, they hearts flutter
I'm like the realest one you ever met
If you don't feel this one, give it a sec
Go live a little, let the years pass
Experience pain, watch the tears crash on to the floor
Hurt brings wisdom
Wisdom brings a whole 'nother sort of understandin'
Diamonds only worth what we demandin', uh, uh
And niggas payin' top-dollar
Once upon a time I paid a 100 for mine, now I'm a lot smarter
It's like she loves me
She loves me
And then she loves me not
She loves me not
Feel like she loves me
Then she loves me not
Hey, I know that this ain't nothing that you used to
Out of the ordinary, unusual
I know you had your whole life planned out
So to watch this pan out I know this shit gotta confuse you
I know you wonder why I had to choose you
Don't wanna take you for granted or abuse you
So I’mma keep it honest
I think it’s a little ironic
If I hit another chick its gonna bruise you
Shit, staring out the window of this plane
Thinking if it crash, I’ll never see your ass again
Wouldn't that be a shame
Cause look at all the shit we overcame
Made it through the flame and never got cremated
I made it to the fame and never got too jaded
All them other couples we fuck with, secretly hated
Flash forward it’s been years, we the only ones that made it
Shit remember I was straying from home
And "Where I Wanna Be" was my favorite song
Sometimes I still be on my Donnell Jones
But I just can’t leave you alone
She know me like a book, its too easy to read my ass
Unhappy stressed, yelling don’t mislead my ass
I mean I make it so easy don’t please my ass
If shit was on the other foot then you would leave my ass
Ay, True that
My song all on the radio
Who Dat
Am I so far gone, used to see both sides like the Mohawk on
Now I know you wonder why this phone lock on
All this time I’ve been with ya you ain't used to do that
I loved your ass way before I knew you could rap
The way you breaking my heart I should sue you for that
Call up my uncles and my cousins have them do you for that
We had a deal and you ain't keeping up your end of the shit
In my mind I know she get the short end of the stick
Try justify thinkin', man we finna be rich
While some bad bitch I barely know sending me flicks
Got a pocket full of lint again but it make no difference to me
Fallin' out with my friends again but it make no difference to me
Goddamn I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
Aw man, I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
Got no gas in my tank again but it make no difference to me
Overdraft at the bank again but it make no difference to me
Lord knows I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, still I pray
I woke up early in the morning, hoes blowing up my phone
I ain't used to small talking when they know I'm tryna bone
Fuck 'em, I'll holla later, man, right now, my mind's elsewhere
My mom's healthcare, get her out this hell here
A lot of niggas fail, frail niggas won't prevail here
We seen it all man, niggas can't even spell scared
A Fresh Prince, but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you would sell, I'm worry bout my welfares
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
Soon as my dough straight, I throw the wifey in some Dolce
And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves
I get up, look out the window, hope the sun shining
Down on my niggas out there front lining
I hit the streets and see them boys out there locking up some older head
So Goddamn homie, hold your head, and hold your head
I get up, I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma, your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though
And to the top I'ma climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my—headed for the sky
I'm on my way
Paint a picture to show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison
Felt you had to resort to crime, man fuck the system
We raisin' babies up in Hades where there ain't no hope
Ain't no fathers, don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollerin' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote
He talk about change, still we floatin' in the same ol' boat
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel when the President spoke
When he ain't never had to struggle, ain't never been broke
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close
Trustin' this government's like trustin' the devil in oath
For rebel with quotes, I get up
Lifestyle of the young, black and reckless
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions like:
"Tell me why I ain't got shit?"
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics as I sip
Yeah, to all my niggas paper chasin', I pray for your patience
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'
Takin this shit one step at a time, that real shit is stuck on my mind
But to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine I'mma find a way, cause hey
Damn it, them jobs out there ain't tryna pay, I pray
Granted nine to five is how you survive
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my Momma in rides
I'mma provide for my seed I'm the soil
I'll teach 'em bout' loyalty
I'll teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
I'll show 'em all the things that my pops was never showin' me
Treat 'em like a growin' tree with this poetry
I get up and show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seed's got tommorow
So please niggas raise your kids
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with
I blaze the shit
If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don’t feel no sorrow
'Cause life is hard mentally and everything is meant to be
Sometimes I ask myself If I was gone who will remember me?
It's hard to tell oh-well sit back and sip this Hennessy
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
Cuz plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why? I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my momma I'll make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggas know it's more to life
Then mackin' hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sort of like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they ballin' like The Dream Team
My nigga I done seen meaner cash
And I'm tryna get it, follow me nigga I'm on a prowl
Headed to the top! You watching me nigga?
Then hold it down
Hold it down, if you need to holla at me
Don’t hesitate to call it ain't a problem
I can be there I’d ride for you, lie for you
I know you’d do the same, I will die for u
So hold it down, when the times is hard, I’ll be around
So hold me down and it don’t matter how far I’ll be around
Yea, I'll hold you down
You were my nigga from the younger days, we grew up
I went to school you went the other way
But still my brother man, I'm sitting, reminiscing on
All of them bitches we were tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink we trying to bag some new hoes
And If I need gear, you let me hold ya new clothes and vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man a nigga slow caking
I'm broke tryna chase a dream, you just got probation and I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant what’s next?
Oh shit my mama doing drugs, at times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when ya mama tried to beat you with that bat shit?
Remember your chick Nina man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina? yo, she still the baddest!
I'm just glad that I can holla at you, it's been a while
And til the next time I hear from you, ay, hold it down!
And these are tough times baby but we’ll make it through
You know I'm headed for the top I swear I'm taking you
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather
The rain falling ain't balling but I have better
A women with an ass and a strong mind, it's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit, sometimes I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart you don’t want me to be no star though
'Cause groupies out there every show you scared I'm fucking every ho
And girl I ain't gon' lie and say I won't 'cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength, I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids, the love is real and if we ever part God forbid
I love you still so when I'm on the road don’t trip, you know im down for you
Keep it tight and don’t slip, and hold it down for me
Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashing
Probably cause I never could
Said if I had it, never would
Then I got my first little taste of paper and I splurged
I guess it's just a nigga urge
This is The Boondocks
I swear, yo, I’m like Huey mixed with Riley
Thursday I be tryna save the world, and then on Friday, I hit the club
Hoping that my dick get rubbed by some fat asses
Niggas get to scrappin' then you hear the gats blasting, damn
Hope them niggas ain't got no problems with me
My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree
You see, I can, but I won’t cause I’m saying what I want
Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep
As the throat on a certified freak, will she choke?
As we headed to the crib, yes, I let her give me head
So she won't 'member where I live, my game is tight
Baby, no need to bring pajamas, you ain't staying the night
No disrespect, I just say it polite
I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life
Like Hov said it, can I live?
Ay, dear Lord, can I live?
Hey, now am I living to get paid, just slaves for a wage, are we?
I can't do no 9-to-5, told my momma sorry
I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the glory
If you knew me, know my life is like a movie starring me
Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams
I ain't reading off the script that they picked for me
I ain't pissed, nah, couldn’t give a shit hardly
I'll be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me
Will I live or will I die before they get to know me?
If I go, I know the ones that’s pouring liquor for me
And I know them fake niggas really hating on me
Knew that I was 'bout to blow, so they was waiting on me
But oh no, Lord
You see, I'm smarter than they know
So hold on, Lord, cause I ain't quite ready to go
Can I live?
Somebody told me that it's only one shot
So I'll be goddamned if I'm ever gonna stop
Promise to my momma I'ma make it to the top
So I'ma keep climbing 'til my heartbeat drop
Like the phone when she heard the news
Her sister on the other line talking to her shoes
The only son, what a thing to lose
More blacks singing more blues
More niggas pouring more brews
Poor dude, he was young like 21, straight up out that city that I'm from
A real smart nigga, but his niggas, they was dumb
He ain't even get a chance to run
Before it landed in his lung
God, breathe nigga
His partner screaming “Don’t you fucking leave, nigga!”
Took off his shirt, tryna stop the bleeding nigga, “Don’t you go!”
But his life fading slow
Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know?
Did I tell my baby sorry from before?
Won't get to see my son grow
Lord, I ain't ready to go
Can I live? Can I live? Dear Lord, Can I live?
Yo, I'm in Atlanta, bruh
Hit me back, lil' nigga
Dead 'em from every side of the spectrum
Hannibal Lecter lecture, body part bone collector
Nosy ass hoes get punched in the septum
That's part of the woes for throwing salt like Epsom
Pardon my bros, kinda off the rocker and steps
Don't step, stupid, or you get slept stupid
East side little Route, Zone 6 vet
Showin' respect, a nigga forever in debt, but don't forget it
Anybody wanna see 'em, I can make 'em a believer
At your neck like Gillette, get you and the nigga next to ya
In present time they sayin' that I'm the next nigga
Woah, woah, that kinda sound like a death trap
Can't see the floor, elevator, where the steps at?
James Bond' 9—James Harden with the step-back
No D, niggas playin' foul, where the techs at?
That's cool, wave the 30 round, where the TECs at?
Better get back, better get you a jetpack
They shoot where the ref at
They shoot at your jefe
They leavin' 'em stank like Pepé Le Pew
They just put a hole in his Pepe
I go where the check at, Margiella Gorilla
They kill a nigga for a thrill, they feel it now, cool, keep it movin'
I won't be the nigga they taking out, breaking down, face down
As far as these rappers man, these words couldn't hurt a nigga
Far as these rappers, I can't count on a ninja turtle's finger
Who really is fucking with the kid, that is J.I.D
I am loud, that is mid, I'm a pound, that's a smidge
I'm a stallion, stout, strong, war ready, resilient
Guess the Lord put me in position just to kill niggas
A warrior, but words used is my spear
My sword, my fear, my Lord, my chance is void if I
Do it for myself and don't give back to the loyal
The unemployed, all my boys in here
Okay, let's really make some noise in here
Heh, oh yeah, yeah
Gon' turn me up some more
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Got a young chick from the hood, Southside
Pops never let her outside
Nigga knew the type of shit she was up against
Little did he know the shit was gon' backfire
Cause she act quiet, got baptized
Sang in the choir, but the thing she desired
Was a older nigga show her how to be a freak
The young girl's in heat, it's deep
She sneaking out, off the leash
On the streets at night when the freaks is out
Butterfly tat on her back that she tried to hide
Until her father found her secret out
Now he flipping out, he kicked her out
She living on her own and it's vicious out
Years go by now I got her in my room
And I'm thinking of the best way to kick her out
It's cold
I told the bitch somebody stole my Rollie
She talking 'bout "Me too"
I came through with the brand new Louis bag
L.A. on my next flight, you guessed right
She saying "Me too"
Now everybody meet Ms. Me Too
Goddamn, be you
And if that is you, you so shallow
You're on a boat that won't travel
Won't float and won't paddle
If I go broke, it won't matter
This stupid ass shit don't make me
I been poor, it won't break me
You're so caught up on material shit
We both knowing that you can't even get
Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis, Louis
All she ever talk about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can't fuck with her no more, ayo, ayo
I mean Louis, Louis
Yeah, keep following me
Keep calling me
Believe in God like the sun up in the sky
Science can tell us how, but it can't tell us why
I seen a baby cry then seconds later she laughs
The beauty of life, the pain never lasts
The rain always pass, the sun don’t always shine (Yeah)
When it's gone I'm lonely, but when it's there I'm fine
I hate the wintertime because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think I'm a nice young nigga
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster
It's funny, hunnid-years-ago I'd've called this nigga, master
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning
Im looking for some higher learning, learning
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning
You say Im easily distracted I think the problem is Im easily attracted by the darkside
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies
I'm tryna separate myself like apartheid
But ay the liquor keep swallowing
I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following
I say the devil keep following, following
Yeah, this is where the
Yeah, this is where the fathers ain't livin', at least not with us
Might see em round the city and won’t even say wassup
When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors
And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error
Just a small town nigga, big city hustle
Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell
These were our heroes, strictly for them zeros
For that Robert De Niro, niggas reload on them kilos, ugh
Dodgin them people, mad at myself 'cause
I done seen some things that I’d rather not tell
Shawty smoke crack and her boyfriend too
And sometimes he touch her daughter how them boyfriends do
Pull up to the club where my boys went too
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue
A nigga on a stretcher and though I never met you
I'm thinkin', "God bless you, the city tryna get you"
Come with me
Run quick see
What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?
La da-da-da, la la la la
Come with me (La da-da-da, la la la la)
It seems like niggas either feel you or they tryna kill you
I face the sky and hope that God ain't acting unfamiliar
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar
They tell me that it's God’s will, I’m asking "God, will ya
Heal a nigga from all this pain?" Mama smokin' cocaine
As it rains out, am I to blame? Try to stay sane
So I came outside where they rock with them thangs out
To clear my mind, the same time they blew that boy brains out
But will it change? It's like niggas is free
But our minds still in the chains, brothers killing each other
The blood spill, it's a shame, will it ever slow up?
A lot of niggas getting older, but they never grow up
And do they sons like they fathers did and never show up
Don’t even cry about it, just another episode of life
Watch the whole season, nigga, no reruns
The devil out here buying souls, nigga, no refunds
Man, don’t let the city get you
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet you, bet your mama need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming, "We miss you"
Another day, another song
A mother prays, another gone
But still we play like ain't nothing wrong
Like ain't nothing wrong, 'cause ain't nothing wrong
I'm not as fast, I’m not as tall
But before I pass, I gotta ball
I gotta ball, I gotta ball
Nigga, I gotta ball
See your homegirl tryna sway you
How you figure I would play you
Would you look at that
The same one that caught her nigga with some freak
All in her sheets left for a week
What she do, double back
Now I know we far from perfect
But I feel like this is worth it, do you disagree with that
If not then holla back
Hey and tell ya girl you’ll call her back
In time of need
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I’ll be there for you
Now, now, now, know we be arguing
But ain't you riding with me
We breaking up we making up
Like Dwayne Wayne and Whitley
You throw things, you broke things
Use both hands and hit me
And right when you call the law
I’ll tell my boy to come get me
Then you, than you start listening
To friends, and then it, gets tricky
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky
So you ignore the hickeys, the pics of chicks in they vicky’s
That they sent me, is that real love
You’re the only one that I will love
Damn, damn
My best friend says
I can stay with her
At her house, no doubt, anytime I like
Don't let you in my life cause you don't do for me and you don't act right
If she was me, she would let you go a long, long time ago
My best friend says, my best friend says
I’ll still be there for you
Girl I can see it in your eyes
How you feeling, let me know whats on your mind
We’ve been together for a long long time
Hey, girl I can see it in your eyes
I know to you it feel like I’m never around
Round, round, round
But if you leave, who else gon hold me down
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Came down the block, somethin' sick, but it's rented
I don't give a fuck, bitch, either way, I'm in it
I ain't gotta prove to you that I got bread
Niggas talkin' money but be broker than the bed
That I slept on back in Mohammed crib
'Member fuckin' hoes leanin' all to the left?
Don't know why they rock wit' a nigga, but they did
Damn sure wasn't the money, maybe it's the kid?
Used to have a honey that I loved when we was younger but somehow got disconnected before Facebook got so big
I used to search her name hopin' we could reconnect
But if I sent the message, would she still be on my dick?
When I couldn't find her, had me feelin' mad lame
Maybe she got married and she changed her last name
Maybe she just ain't up on the latest of the internet and ain't got into that
But give her time, that'll change
Bingo, what do you know?
Years later (Right), late night after a show we here laid up (Right)
Brown skin, love how it glow, your hair tied up (Right)
Ask, "Is it cool if I smoke?" Go 'head, light up (Right)
High from your fragrance, I love, you smell purrty (Smells good)
Know I got it straight from the mud, my nails dirty (Right)
If somehow we both lose touch, I won't lie, ya got me open way too much, I'm gon' find ya
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey
Welcome to the life of a nice brother
Light skind-ed, black father, white mother
Tried to be a player, found out I'm a slight lover
Come from Carolina, I'm fly, I'm a Wright Brother
Went away to school looking for the right lover
You know, someone that you could cut and never worry 'bout a rubber
She had a man, I be damned, think I might love her
Thought about her ass for the whole damn Summer
Man I even memorized her whole damn number
This is my semester dog, I'm coming to arrest her
Y'all you know, handcuff her, her ex man, fuck him
Oh nah don't be appalled man, that nigga was a dog
So it's me now, and she be everywhere I be now
I wonder, should I tell her what her fella wanna be now?
The dreams I been dreaming and them things I wanna see now
Do that make you wanna leave or would you still hold me down?
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gon' do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
'Ey maybe we can live (just like a star)
Hey, for you I always had an admiration
We lost touch but you never left my imagination
Congratulations on your graduation
Oh now it's time to hit the real world, filled with all them résumés and applications
Man, but ain't nobody calling you back
You say it's cause you a woman and even more cause you black, imagine that
The weight of everything on your plate
You got the world on your back baby, if you can relate, man I feel for you
'Ey has this world got too real for you?
Your old friends say you changed but I still know you
You that same old girl I used to take home from school
Tryna look cool, forgot I had the brake on, damn
Time passed and you done grew up
And yeah, it's just like I told you baby look I done blew up
But the money and this little bit of fame ain't changed me
So holla when you need me, I bet you you'll get the same me
Just like a star that's in my sky
Just like an angel off my page
You have appeard to my life
It feels like we never be the same
Damn and it's been, way too long
Can't find the words to write this song
Hey, uh, still I wonder why
But it ain't what I do
Hey, we do it all the time
Goin' out my mind
Man, damn
Just like a star
My girl booty soft and it's shaped like a skrawberry
Her pussy bald with a tat like Stephon Marbury
Carry all my dirt to the grave, I'm the pallbearer
Bury all of my sins, staring out of the Benz
Gone off weed, gone off Hen', gone with the wind
Gone with the pretty long heiress with the fairest skin
Yelling in her face, and she repeat it like a parrot and
Apparently, she gone keep yelling at me, I'ma never win
Where your ass was at when I was sleeping on the couch
And in the whip?
Probably with another nigga, on another nigga dick
I'm on another tip, my skin so tint, strength on strength
One on ten against me, I won't break, I don't bend
Watch your statements, guard your chin
Guard your heart, guard your light
Find your zen, mind your lightness
You doing without cause you ain't looking within
But if you ever in doubt, give this a spin
Check, look, cool
I mean shawty had relations that we never could speak about
You get mad, I'm mad, we sleep it out
And then she had a man who used to beat her
So she told me she wanted out
Got a couple abortions, now that pussy's a haunted house
Now her heart cold, Antartica, Siberia
Had it planned out, curriculum, criteria
Change, she feel pain, strain, built-up anger
From dealing with a dickhead, putting her life in danger
I understand, it's times that you go through your women things
And sometimes can't gauge clearly on what you be thinking
I swear I got your back and got the tab on what you drinking
You ain't gotta move a finger or pinky when we linking
Whatever keeps your boat afloat or ship sinking
From loose lips of side women stepping out of position
Breaking out of a system, prison
Parallelogram, shaping the prism, stop signs never stopped I
Let's be realistic, I been trying to get in touch with my senses
And be better to my sisters
But niggas think that you feminine when you sensitive
My homegirl rap, and she feminist
Hold it down for the women, I call her "Feminem"
Tell 'em how you really feel headass
'Cause ass shots are dead ass and fake tits been around, we gas it
Girl, you perfect without that makeup or the plastic surgery
I'ma tell you how it is like Ron Burgundy
Fayettenam, yeah
Bitch
Yeah, I'm sipping liquor for the pain, pouring liquor for the slain
Nothing else can do the trick like hard liquor to the brain
Fall victim to the game, all this money we spent
In my mind, tryna figure where this 20 G's went
Maybe I should slow it down, maybe take the pace slow
Second thought, I think I need to speed it up and make mo'
Time to build, Lego, in the Ville, laid low
Counting days, still waiting on that shit I prayed for
Am I ungrateful? Want it all so quick
Feel a vibrate, hold up, I got a call, old bitch
How she get my new shit? Swear the city too small
Type of chick won't take her shirt off cause her titties too small
I could give a damn, girl, lift up that pretty blue bra
Now I'm in the deep, seeing just how pretty you are
And that kitty go hard
Lord, I'm up in that
Got the type of kitty cat that make a nigga double back
Type of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love with that
At the door wit a towel on and nothin' under that
Saying welcome
Yeah, welcome
I let these words flow out like water from a spout
Like rain from the clouds, rush the pain from the crowd
Cause these words go deep from my soul when I speak
Then the flows hit the souls of all those that I've reached
If I die 'fore I wake, hope my songs live on
Will they miss me when I'm gone and if so, for how long?
So much shit is on my brain, try hard to maintain
Sit and analyze my thoughts, at times I wonder if I'm sane
Man, it's hard to trust friends when the paranoia blends
With the marijuana, wonder will this high ever end?
Swear I'll never smoke again, y'all niggas blow the weed
Let me take another shot, man, this liquor's all I need
Just to put me in the zone, so far away from home
Nobody truly know me, got me feelin' so alone
They wonder what's on my mind, what's lingerin' in my dome
I tell 'em ain't nothin' wrong, I deal with it on my own
I deal with it on my own
Yeah, I deal with it on my own, nigga
Yeah, oh, welcome
This is Shaniya Davis, last seen wearing a blue sleep shirt and pink underwear. The search for the little girl is now entering its 11th hour in Fayetville, and there’s some disturbing new details
Fayettenam nigga
Dreamville nigga
J. Cole
Hey, ah
I ain't ready yet
Yeah, I ain't ready yet
Gettin' higher than the soul of little Shaniya
And to the ones that killed her, hope you burn in fire
I’m burnin' tires on the strip, tryna get a grip
Liquor in the cupholder, tryna get a sip
6 shots of Hennessey, I’m still goin' strong
Please numb me from the bullshit that’s goin' on
That girl was 5 years old that they just murdered
And did some wicked shit to her that was unheard of
You fuckin' coward, ain’t gotta tell em’ go to Hell
'Cause that’s the shit that make them other niggas sick in jail;
So you gon’ feel it
Travel the world reppin' this city, know I’m gon' kill it
But yet a nigga ain’t got a clue..
How I’m gon' deal with all the bullshit
Niggas sendin' shots my way
You put a hit out on me, think that I’m gon' stop? No way
Gon' have to kill me, or witness a nigga livin' so filthy
Young, black, and wealthy, nigga for that I’m guilty
Still see all the fake shit, it’s funny somehow
Thought the money could erase it, no matter how
Much dough you got you gotta face it, and to my niggas gone
Hope you in a better place, if I make it I’ll holla…
See world, huh-uh
You’re no good, uh-uh, hey
Yeah, see world
You’re no good, uh-uh
No matter how I hate flashbacks and rewinds
Can’t escape the pain that be trapped in my mind
Nigga, see world
You’re no good
Uh, I got a chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget
The industry overlook me, for that I be holding grudges
Wouldn’t take a chance on me, suddenly it's, oh you love it
Let's get a Cole feature, that's gon' put you over budget, now
Picture being broke without no pot to piss in
And then suddenly your idols is your competition
Used to be like God to me, slowly losing my religion
As these notes from my composition turn to competitions, then
Put it out and hope the world sing
We sippin’ liquor for the pain that the world bring
We had dreams just to make it up the flag pole
Just to find out that our heroes were some assholes, y’all don't hear me
Maybe I had the world figured out wrong
When these niggas go from singing our songs and waiting on you
'Bout a year later the same ones be hatin’ on you
Every other record these rappers be faking on you
Dog, we sing your songs but we know that ain’t you
We know you gotta make the people pay you
'Cause either you play the game or watch the game play you
And be that broke muthafucker talkin' 'bout “I stayed true”
Yeah, see world, huh-uh
By candlelight, they stood as one, numb with shock and disbelief. A little girl's body, found Monday, is believed to be five-year-old Shaniya Davis, missing since last Tuesday. Davis has been charged with the unthinkable; prostituting her five year old daughter. Security camera’s spotted a man carrying Shaniya into a hotel last Tuesday. This man, police said, is now charged with Shaniya’s kidnapping. Search parties found the girl’s body yesterday a 100 feet off-road, wearing only a t-shirt
I’m ’bout to cop the Porsche
Eternally grateful for the support, made the cover of The Source
Flashback to the ports the city of no remorse
Where they shooting back and forth like they playing horse
May the force be with you, bullet hit you
You bleed and I bleed with you
Mama please when you grieve, damn I grieve with you
This a preview, I see you in the summer, my new shit dumber
I’m on
Who gon' bring my crown? And who gon’ try to fuck with me?
Faded off the brown, she can't get enough of me
I don't play around, don't got that type of luxury
Bitch it's going down, and ain't no catching up to me
Yeah, stepped in the building with my vibe on a million
Slide on the beat like my God, I'm so brilliant
All other rappers, put your pride to the side
Try collide with the squad, turn your mob into corn on the cob
You's a fraud, you's a thorn in my side
I'm a knife in your back, I'm that turn of the knob
On the door when the boys from the corner come rob you
And tie you up to something, now stop with all that frontin'
That big money talk should be reserved for those that got it
But when you really got it, you ain't pressed to talk about it
That's why I hear that capping on your raps and highly doubt it
The game too crowded, I'm 'bout to get all the way the fuck up out it
No ifs, ands or buts about it
30 mil' on a deal depending on how the tour was routed
I seen your watch when you first dropped, that shit was clouded
Which means you used to fugazi shit
Fake it 'til you make it-type, I shoot through you crazy with
Hollow tips, no holler backs, just hotter raps
I gotta black to make sure every dirty dollar stacked
Y'all aiming for the stars, bitch, I'm aiming at your Starter cap
Run, nigga, run like a fucking black quarterback (uh)
Stereotypical, but to hear me is pivotal
I will bury you niggas and come and air out your funeral
Have your homies on stretchers right next to Roman numerals
IVs, IVs
It's the reason why nobody try me, try me
Have a nigga screaming, "Lord, why me? Why me? Cole did me grimy
He took it too far, he treat them bullets like they Siamese"
Back to back, I clap like that's a wrap
But no video shoots, just hoodies and boots
Puttin' your troops in pine boxes
I blew a million on white tees and Calvin Klein boxers
This nigga silly
My boy, my boy, my boy, my boy
My boy, my boy, my boy, say what!
Who gon' bring my crown? And who gon' try to fuck with me?
Faded off the brown, and she can't get enough of me
Bitch it's going down, it ain't no catching up to me
Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch
The dopest dope you smoke, gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth
Get my girl angry and pissed and give that pussy a kiss
Pushing the same piece of shit until I get me a Bentley
Same niggas, same goals, same dreams and epiphanies
Me and my niggas are same lines as symmetry, wasn't empathy
Remember we would front yard brawl with big Timothy?
Kicked them doors because we had a lot of energy
My brother was locked up for shooting at the enemy
Caught one nigga then caught fifteen
I ain't meet that nigga 'til I was fifteen
Now I'm kicking 16's with a big screen in attempt to get the big cream
Little guy with a big dream, I need guidance
'Cause if I don't succeed, I probably proceed violence
Sippin' on the brown, no Bobby, I don't fuck with nobody
No team and no posse, you can catch it like Shockey
King of all kings, praise Haile Selassie
Rastafari, I don't need nobody, the God's got me
You ain't used to the hustle, bro
Yeah, that shit how you live
We on a trade for a trade
I do this for you, I do this for you, you know what I mean?
I took the risk, you took the risk, I ain't disrespect it
So part of the reason I be so hard on my people
We never had it easy, never had a pot to pee in
I be on my knees praying till my onomatopoeia's packing a coliseum
Ain't no parking, I gotta see J.I.D
Gotta be there for my family, I gotta, can't try to be
I could be out of my mind, thinking logically
No apologies for speaking how I feel, I silently swore solemnly
That I would be the guy to make my black people proud of me
Roses to the mothers of anybody that doubted me
Yo' chick want dick, bitch dove in the covers
Overseen my areas, surveyed over my brothers
You touch them, you kill me, you can't get close to none of us
They still double-dribble, we going for triple-doubles
Triple up on your investment fuckin' with us
Probably have to rock that vest shit, you fuckin' with us
Wait (Nah bro) Huh? (What you talkin' 'bout, homes?)
The dopest dope you smoke gon' get you a whiff
Okay but fuck that shit, I gotta get it, I gotta get 'em
Tired of picking these locks, you don't respect my existence
I used to sleep in my car, never a park or a bench
But damn a nigga was broke, damnit if I didn't get it
Them niggas was thinking that it was just some rap for the kid
One day they gon' hit my phone, hit the show, scream, clap for the kid
Let's get it poppin', they're pulling pistols on apostle Paul
So pay the piper or meet the sniper, legend of the fall
I knew in diapers you and I was nothing alike at all
I do or die, you do it to die, I'm really making calls
You couldn't kill it and take it out of me, the ideology
This the odyssey, I'm Odysseus, you gotta follow me
Watch how I maneuver, I influence the influencers
The flow is like the flu in influenza going through the motion
So I motivate all of my niggas, they tell me kill 'em with kindness
I'd rather kill 'em and their other significants
Writing lyrics in the city with pretty booties and titties
Don't get the cooties, it ain't like the movies
It kinda is 'cause they're shooting, kind of shit is you moving?
Shit I'm pushing, empower the people life where I grew up
Someone tutored the students, these niggas stupidest, stupider, stupid shit
Sick as a bitch, flick of the wrist, my pen cleanse my many sins
The irony the iron can't straighten out any wrinkle in existence
Ripple in time triple my eyes realistically sick in the mind
Sick in the head?
Wish I was dead, sick on a med, addicted
My lead sick 'em, give 'em, send 'em to hell, eh
Okay, okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a—
Okay, I told motherfuckers I—
Rise above, rise above
And you’ve got to
She had a little daughter with her, it was cold out
She said “ah, I hate this motherfucker,” then she rolled out
He ain’t answering his phone, she yells “what the fuck?!”
Then told her daughter “buckle up, yeah, that’s for safety”
See she been stressin’ lately
‘Cause this nigga she done been with for the past two years
Is now the current reason for her last few tears
She text, he don’t text back
When she see him she be tryna sex, he don’t sex back
His heart be on jet black
She call, he don’t call back, all he say is “fall back”
A nigga just need his space, so she headed to his place
Cause she just got a call from her homegirl Rhonda
Who said he been creepin’, he been fuckin’ with Yolanda
“Yolanda? Yeah girl, Yolanda”
“Told you he ain’t shit but you ain’t listen, I was tryna” –
“Click” – hmmm, hung up that phone and hopped right up in that Honda
Headed to his crib, she said she fed up with this shit
“Thought this time this was the one, thought I got better at this shit”
“Pickin’ out Mr. Right, stick it out through the fights”
“And long nights, for what? These niggas is all alike”
She gon’ set it off, her daughter gon’ witness it all tonight, damn
She said she just finished school, could barely pay tuition
Now she teaches 7th grade, tryna make a difference
Aye, but the kids frustrate her, say that they don’t listen
A ass like that, how the fuck they supposed to pay attention?
I’m fuckin’ with you, but for real, she say they hopeless
A class full of jokesters, creating all the obstacles, impossible to focus
Little niggas barely read, tryna give them what they need
And they don’t even try, one little boy, he caught her eye
‘Cause he look just like her brother, she be havin’ to call his mother
But she act like she don’t care – what father? He ain’t here
Now she frustrated, thinkin’ that she just made the mistake of her life
Underpaid, be havin’ to waitress at night
Six years of college down the drain, drinkin’, tryna drown her pain
Party with her girls, feeling sorry for the world
‘Cause ain’t no hope for the youth, well ain’t that the truth
When all your role models either rappin’ or they hoop, damn
I'm just thankful
18 years of suffering gone just like that
You've been suffering 18 years yourself
You've been going through pure hell but it can be over just that fast
This is pastor Kerney Thomas and I literally have tens of thousands across the country
That were hurting for God to heal them
And God could work a miracle for them
All you gotta do is either log on to our website
Or you can dial the toll-free number
And place your order right there
For the Personal Prayer Package
I want you quickly, to place that order right now
Pick up the telephone right now
I said pick up the phone right now
You're past due a miracle
Da-da-dum
You gotta ask Jake One for the beat, though
I don't know if he gon' be cool with lettin, I don't know, man
It's really some album shit that we just, takin' it up
Yeah, winter schemes for my summer dreams
Winning seems to become routine, it's my thing
Underdog, never under y'all
I touch down in your city like a hundred yard
Dash, never punt at all, last thing I need is four downs
My baddest just graduated from Georgetown
Grad school 'cause a nigga like 'em grown up
I'm seeing rappers in the gym tryna tone up
I've seen rappers on the road, no one showin' up
I feel partially to blame, let me own up
I'm sorry, brand new Ferrari
Really though I'm just frontin', I really don't mind discussin'
That Bugatti in that Beyoncé video was just for stuntin'
Scared to mash the gas 'cause if I fucked around and crashed
That woulda been my ass, that whip is 'bout a million cash
Million cash? And dog I just got rich
How you gonna take a million from me, dog? I just got this
Came a long way from that weak ass advance
Was in the Honda on that LIE passing fast
Wasn't bout the money then 'cause he had the chance
Built it from the ground up, no hit singles
Just a lot of fucking gifts, nigga, no Kris Kringle
Cole, I'm the reason that your old bitch single
Gave her dick, made her whole shit tingle, ya wan' feel me?
Born sinner, doubt this diamond chain gon' heal me
Lord, let me kill the game and pray the game don't kill me
Huh, multi before I die bitch, believe that
These rappers rich as fuck but don't know where they seeds at
It's a shame, niggas lame, this is fame for ya
I gotta be the only one that didn't change for ya
I saw ya sortin' through trash and brought change for ya
Open up their lane, do I gotta say names for ya?
Ha, and I ain't even flexin'
Plottin' on that Warm Up 2, I'm just stretchin'
Fourth quarter, so much due, but fuck stressin'
I just step into the ring and do my ma'fuckin' thing
My ma'fuckin' thing, ja
This verse never before rehearsed, it was wrote on site
To slit a nigga throat on sight
Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight
Cole World, zip your coat up tight
I put your soul on nice, illiterate, the boy don't write
Never met a beat that the flow don't like
It's cold, Young C.O., L.E., call me Neo
And if I ain't the one, I'm the prototype
Woo, insane how I rhyme
All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines
Shame y'all lying, me I'm the truth
Dog-eat-dog world nigga, we on the loose
Niggas don't wanna hang, I'm the tree, I'm the noose
You lil pups couldn't pee on my roots
Touch the people, I could be a masseuse
Thoughts black, I should be in The Roots
While y'all foulin', me I just shoot
Fallon, Jimmy, nigga
Asked for it nice now it's gimme nigga
Once poor now it's plenty, nigga
Still want more, no Demi, nigga
Serve niggas quick like Denny's
Got pennies for my thoughts, now look what I done bought
Did the most with what I was taught
A Carolina nigga bound to be the greatest, this a hell of a start
Cole, World, nigga
Double M-G, Dreamville shit
Yeah, back from the dead like Michael Jackson in red jackets
With naps in my head, who's white or black? It's a rare package
Get smacked if you said that I'm neck and neck with them square rappers
My guest room's got plantinum plaques and a air mattress
No time for furniture shopping, too busy burnin' you
Watching you, learning you, word to Pac, I'm plottin' to murder you
Sure the thought didn't occur to you, my next album flop
Then I'm goin pop like Nelly with tops dropped on convertible
Porsches, born sinner, not burning no crosses
Might burn a couple bridges, I'm losing by double digits
I gotta do somethin', fightin' depression, I'm trying my nigga
But everytime I think about it, I'm cryin' my nigga
Cried myself to sleep on thousand dollar sheets
I reak of the scent of a vendetta that's deep
I'm playing for keeps, but you ain't think I'd bounce back
They love to hear a black nigga count stacks, count stacks
Forty thousand in my pocket, you see it
Another twenty on the way, you see it (Ay)
I got a fist full of dollars, you see it (Uh)
Five hundred for the Js, you see it (Ay)
I got money out the ass, you see it
I thought I'd never see the day, you see it (Ay)
They put a price on my head, you see it
But they won't ever have to pay, you see it (Ay yeah)
I fell down on my knees and yeah I prayed
Cause Heaven seems a million miles away
I dreamed of all the things that I would say
On that day
But for now I'm cooking up in Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Nigga fuck you and your fake well wishing
I'll get out of Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
Tell my story, I'm just hopin' they'll listen
Cooking up in Hell's Kitchen, Hell's Kitchen
One day, hey
Shawty, she got the body
She did the molly
Probably gonna do the squaddy
Right after papi
Sloppy, she extra choppy
Just did the potty
I love that bitch, the perfect thottie
The perfect thottie
Got it locked, I got lots of keys
Fuck nigga don't start with me
Oh my god, oh my god I’m a novelty
At least that’s what she said when she swallowed menovelty
Your bitches had the ball, my bitches pass the ball
And this dick is a gift for that love degree, hey
Heard you graduating, girl congratulations
This ain't prom but can I take you home as if your fam was waiting
At the front door with that 44 cocked
Strictly for the survivors
The 800 number dodgers
Boy, what I tell ya ass bout picking up that phone
When the number unknown
Tell them people I ain't home
Half black learning white lies
Niggas broke her heart now she trying white guys
Too ashamed to bring him 'round cause her homegirls’ll clown like
“Girl I ain't know you like ‘em bite size"
She embarrassed now
On edge cause she gotta meet his parents now
They probably think I’m no good for ‘em
Too dark, too thick, too hood for ‘em
Now she sitting at the dinner table wondering what I’m doing here
They got me feeling like a job interview in here
They asking questions about her 5 year plan
She saying “who I’m fooling, they could never understand”
They could never understand
(Fuck is that smell)
I smell bullshit, it must be an election year
The more I listen man the more you sound less sincere
Still I’m watching CNN tryna keep up
In my interviews maybe I should speak up
Tell the world how I feel like you lying all the time
And keep ‘em niggas walking 'round blind all the time
But the same niggas think I’m fucking dimes all the time
Like I'm walking round with money on my mind all the time
And I feed into it
I’d rather make tracks where I bleed into it
The single's only the look to sell these niggas the book
I can only pray that one day you’ll read into it
If not, fuck it, I got my own problems
Fuck ya beats nigga I produce my own albums
I zone out that old sound that I've grown out of
Was born out of being broke with hope
But it don’t matter I’m on Saturn now and I won’t shatter
As long as this blood grows in my bone marrow I’m gonna gather my thoughts
As sharp as a bow and arrow
Back when I had no dough and no apparel
My flow’s thorough, now I’m more aware of all the perils a nigga face
Loaded pistols with nickle plates is a nigga fate
And why they call this shit a race
The agony of defeat, wish the elite could get a taste
Straight out The Ville and I made it
Like a villain I'm hated
I see 'em grillin', I ate it though
Finna blow inflatable, that's undebatable, uh
I'm givin' niggas food for thought, the flow is catered, yo
I'm never faded though
Haters wanna see me broke, but me and the dough related, ho
It's like my only son, where I go, he come
Niggas dumb to be braggin' bout that stupid shit
Nah I don't stunt on niggas, I show'em how to do this shit
I'm somethin' like the light-skin version
Of the very same baby that The Virgin Mary raised
That's word to everything
Nigga life a scary game but I'm playin'
You sucka niggas lie in everything that ya sayin'
Shame on y'all, you tryna ball with the game on pause
A nigga pull the thing on y'all, y'all stain y'all draws
Fuck you niggas, but this ain't raw dog
I got protection, lethal weapons, and they aim on y'all
I'm like the man on mars; I'm high as hell
Watch me blow like I exhale, I excel in this rap shit
Cause y'all spittin' that wack shit
And every nigga suddenly be rappin' bout that trap shit
So while you niggas copy cat the cats that made classics
I just massacre the streets, I'm a master of the beats and the rhymes
I'm rappin' for the freaks and the dimes
And I shine like a mothafuckin' diamond
You shine like a mothafuckin' dime
That's word to my mom
I don't mind if you niggas hate
Just know you hatin' on that nigga, nigga get it straight
I'm spittin' hungry like ain't shit up on my dinner plate
The kind a flow that make a nigga hyper-ventilate (ugh)
See let me demonstrate
I grew up with nothin', it hurt me to see my mother poor
The only pops a nigga ever seen around was Huxtable
And so the muscle flow is something you can't get no muzzle for
Look how the buzz will grow
Ballin' 'til the buzzer blow
Man I'm hungry, does it show?
Ain't nothin' funny, fuck a joke
I'm gettin' money til my pockets need a tummy tuck
I hope you niggas woke now, impermanentely
Send you to hell, you meet the devil, sign a permanent lease
Word on the streets is I'm the prince nigga, check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the King, nigga: young simba
Word on the streets is I'm the Prince nigga, check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the king, nigga: young simba
She’s a star if I ever seen one
Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one
So now I’m under pressure I want it bad
She got something I never had
I see ya looking at me
Bad bitches get low
Bad bitches get low right now
Please show love, make way for the bad girls club
Hey, Cole World
Down for whatever
Boy got dollars, pounds or whatever
Being broke in this sadity ass world
Still found a way to get pretty ass girls
Killin’ y’all niggas, any last words
Cause you didn’t play the game right
Hey girl, before you throw it at me
You gotta make sure you aim right
Red dots cause I’m red hot
Seen, but damn girl you smoking
I get paper like I a mail box, seen
But girl you got me open
Proceed, pocket full of G’s
Kush, baby mama-less; yeah no seeds
Blow trees like a hurricane
Damn, if looks kill, then ya murderin’
Damn!
Hey, this is the story of a young’n dreamin'
Left his city to see if he could be what he dreamin’
Big city on his own shit
But every now and then a nigga get homesick
Pick up the phone, holla at my partner he telling me, be warned
A lot of shit done changed in the time that you’ve been gone
The streets got meaner, the hoes got growner
And went and got babies the day they got they diploma
Damn, gon’ be some niggas missing when you fly back
If you black, they sending you to jail or to Iraq
Old buddy that we hoop with, with the bad chick and a fly 'lac
And a gold chain? Caught him on the Merc, tryna buy crack
Damn homie! Shit, in high school you was the man homie
The fuck happened to you?
Used to beat niggas down at the buses after school
Now you looking like a motherfucking fool
Said I’ll be home for the holidays
So when you see me, better holla at me
I gotta get up out this city ‘fore it try to trap me
I gotta leave, I wish I could stay
But I’ll be home for the holidays
And to those that I used to know
From way before, keep your head up
Come lets get this bread up
Girl, I gotta go, wish I could stay
But I’m coming home for the holidays
Hey, this is a story bout some puppy love
But at the time boy, I was feeling like this must be love
Although now I'm on my grown shit
She bad as hell, a nigga still get home sick
I was fresh up off a scholarship
Dressed like a black man in college shit
Got a little knowledge now I’m following the politics
But I still gotta holla at my old chick
So sweet, so thick, girl pick up your phone, it’s me
She said “what, we ain't homies no more”
You go to college now you act like you don’t know me no more
Girl please, we got history, semester seem so long
The last time I seen ya baby you ain't have no clothes on
So if history repeats itself
When I get home, girl it's on, you ain't gone need ya belt
Or your pants or your drawers, then we hit the rewind
Just don’t give it up in the meantime
Man I reminisce on them school days
I know you know them act a fool days
That missed the bus then hit the blunt and go to school blazed
Trying to get laid so I gotta stay fly
But a nigga hella shy you would have thought that's where the bulls play
Was just a freshman could used a little Kool-aid (cool aid)
Crushing on them upper classmen but it was too late
Buddy she was dating, yeah, he had the freshest shoes
But the nigga graduated and he never made two A’s
Hey if you’re listening we got in school
But who will pay our tuition man
These niggas crazy
One year cost about same as a Mercedes (benz)
Four years cost wife, crib, and a baby
Ay maybe this ain't for me
Only if I could be LeBron and go straight to league
The worst part of growing up man: shit just ain't for free
Maybe I can be somebody people pay to see
And maybe I should move up out here to the place to be
To get from A to Z, aye what you think I'm crazy
If I told you one day that I'ma sign with Jay-Z
And will I make it man I guess we gotta wait and see
I'm a fool, hundred thousand for the jewels
Last year we killed the game and left y'all browsing for the clues
Old niggas out here searching for that fountain of the youth
Money talks and hoes say it's an arousing point of view
Don't make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit
How could you justify, I testified up in this booth
And then, throughout the years, spilled tears and shed truth
Somehow they love a nigga better when he talk about his loot
Chain like a kaleidoscope, see life through a wider scope
Therefore, I know this necklace really represents a noose
Still I hit the jeweler how much racks to make me cooler
I just play the game homie, I ain't make the rules up
Started from the bottom same way you lace your shoes up
So if I'm blowing cake, just blame it on the place I grew up
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television
Got no plans of seeing hell or prision
You can tell I'm living, right?
Never said I'm living right
I'm a fool, hundred thou to go to school
So much debt me and my mama damn near drowning in a pool
The first to go to college, they say knowledge is a tool
But these hoes on campus make a young nigga drool
So we party, skip class, get ass and talk cool
Meanwhile, she back home working hard, I use that as my fuel
So I finally graduated but I'm sad to say it
I ain't learn a fucking thing except the game and how to play it
I'm a fool, no scuffs on my shoes
No cuts, I don't bruise, so fuck y'all reviews
She told me "Cole, I love you rode with you way before the riches
But you way too educated to be calling women bitches
And calling brothas niggas, pardon if I cross a line
But all this time knew you was different than all them other niggas"
I responded to her "please don't put me on a pedestal
Cuz I know better and I'm still a fool"
What's love
Got to do, got to do with it? (Yeah)
I get a lil taste then I’m through with it
Then I send her right back to you with it (Ha ha), hey, how high?
(Hey) What's love (How high?)
Got to do, got to do with it? (How high?)
I get a lil taste then I’m through with it (How high?)
Yeah, I send her right back to you with it
Visionary, play your position, no missionary
But yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke
You listening to the most high like the Pope on dope
Now picture that, my poetry’s deep, now fish for that
Only real niggas catch something, phoney niggas fail
Shit you gotta feel like it’s only read in braille
Both did the crime but his homie didn’t tell
So he fucking bitches while he sitting lonely in a cell
"Thinking well, what the hell I been on
They gave a nigga five then they threw another ten on
By the time I’m back in the streets like a bachelor
I gotta play the clubs with the old ass women"
Life is a movie, pick your own role
Climb your own ladder or you dig your own hole
You sit around crying, that's like sitting round dying
You wanna touch the sky? Bitch, you figure out flying
Nigga, how high? So high that I could touch the sky
How sick? So sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
Nigga please, my squad stack plenty of G’s
And if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees
How high? So high that I could touch the sky
Hey, as the troubles of the world unfurl
My niggas hit the trees like squirrels
Tryna get a nut with your girl, think I need to quit tryin'
‘Fore some nigga out there try to hit mine
Karma for the Kama Sutra
A lot calmer when the ganja’s through ya
You need ya armour cause them niggas out here tryna shoot ya
Kinda crucial, police piranha, gon snatch you out that Honda
For stashing that marijuana
Yes, ya honour, I feel ashamed
I broke the law but look I’ll never smoke or steal again
In your courtroom wylin’, I don’t mean to keep smiling
But right now I’m high enough to probably steal a plane
Man, just look at me, what if I couldn’t read?
Would you throw the book at me
What if I’m feeling sad, am I supposed to look happy
It’s been a long time coming
Tell my nigga roll me up something
Nigga how high? so high that I could touch the sky
How sick? so sick that I could fuck yo’ bitch
No I dont smoke, maybe once in a blue
When the tension gets thick then there’s nothing to do
Through the windows of my soul, open the blind
My eyes get shut but I open my mind
How high? la la la la
How high? hey hey hey
How high? yeah yeah yeah yeah
Is that a shot that you threw little man?
I understand, you frustrated career ain't going how you planned
Make it worse, your friends, now when they talk rap
All you hear is “J Cole this” and “J Cole that”
It must be hard for your pride just to take all that
I know your weak heart gotta break off that
Boy, look, Cole World this is your worst fear
I’m burning you niggas and I’m only in first gear
I’m serving you niggas this is only the first beer
12 months from now, you’ll be having the worst year
No tears for the haters, I’m still counting money
Cole ain't dropping, thats real fucking funny
Grade A dummy, sleeping on a nigga raps
Something like a mummy
But I’mma wake yo’ ass up
Something like your mommy on school day
I smoke two l’s with ya girl this is Cool J
How high?
How high? yeah
Whats love got to do, got to do with it
I get a little taste then I’m through with it
Yeah I send it right back to you with it
Just one of them days, a nigga feel like flossin’
A Stone Cold Stunner, bitch, I'm Steve Austin
Cool as Drew Brees, I’m blowin' a few Gs
Just to hear them hoes say he’s awesome
He’s awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me
Pulled up beside me in that big body and stunted on me
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me
Well look, I’m back, bitch, back with an attitude
Buyin' out the bar, cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved
Now I’m tippin' the server a hundred to show my gratitude
Easy, told you I’d be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me
Now I’m living just like the niggas you see on TV
VIP feeling like this club oughta thank me
I hit the bar just so y’all can see I’m ballin’, HD
It’s cost me a lot
Big chains, big whips with wood grain
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob
Fast life and till the gas light
Copped the type of shit you couldn’t get at half price
Look but don’t touch motherfucker, think twice
Now I don’t love no material things
But I’m in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn, how, how, how he do that
Damn, how, how, how, how he do that
Knee deep in the game, my chain heavy
Somebody get the pilot and ask is the plane ready
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we takin' off
Don’t wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can’t take it off
Cause how I’m supposed to shine without the proper bling
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame
Felt naked cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain
Thats five hundred years of swellin', I’m tryna tell 'em
Jacob the Jeweler is cooler now he a felon
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn’t mail him
If he couldn't sell him, so what that tell him, huh
My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough
Must be the money like Deion with the Jheri curl
White Range, call that motherfucka Larry Bird
I got em hangin' on every word
Hmm
Vhari, vhari
God is real and he usin' me for a bigger purpose
So fuck the world that would have you think that a nigga worthless
Sometimes I think that these verses can help a person
Way more than the ones they readin' in churches on days of worship
No disrespect to the Lord and Savior, that ain't just ego
I just observe that them words no longer relate to people
'Cause modern times be flooded with dollar signs
And social media stuntin', my niggas just wanna shine
They frame of mind so far removed from the days and times
Of Nazareth
Life these days is a labyrinth, in a maze so elaborate
We barely get through half of it 'fore it's too late
My niggas is felons from sellin' weight in more than two states
.22 in his waist before he could even shoot straight
Quick to draw on you like Aaron McGruder, nigga who fate?
All of that to say maybe the hood need a new faith
A new story about a boy from not too far where you stay
Want you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm
Want you to fly, want you to fly, there you go
Want you to fly, want you to fly, here you go
Cole World, niggas praying for that heat
As the globe twirl, gotta stay up on your feet
'Fore I say it to my girl, I say it to the beat
Then I play it for the world and they say that shit is, deep
Hm, my life changing as we speak
They acting like they never seen a nigga on the beach
I say "Peace," hope it ain't no sharks in my water
Then holla at my mama, man she love to see Obama
Do his, thing, now look how far niggas done came
They had us on the chains now we copping bigger chains
I ain't saying that it's smart, old nigga don't trip
But they had with the whips now we copping bigger whips
Oh shit, wonder how bad will it get 'fore he rise
I'm out here trying to get rich, I survived
And a nigga got God to thank
And I'm still throwing five in the tank, nigga
And then they seen him do the, uh
He'll do another version of the song freestyle
He did like three, three, four songs
Over one beat
All freestyle, like which one we like?
Yeah, man, just let me know, I'ma text you
Aight, bet
For sure, guys
I fuck with you, bro
Pleasure's mine, bro
Nice to meet y'all, bro
Aight, bro, aight, bro
Be blessed, bro
Yeah, you too, bro
Congratulations on your...
Aba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm
Oh, I swam for miles, only to realize the current
Is fightin' against me and I'm so tired, I'm floatin' now
Oh, from here on out, I've got to realize the power
Of learnin' to let go, and just let God
Enjoy the ride
Born into pain, alcoholic veins
Over-analytical brain a product of the shame
And runnin' from a past, that's checkered like the game
Somewhere 'long the way somebody snatched my peace and main
Maybe that's the reason I spent decades seekin' fame
And fortune hopin' that a proper portion would contain
The sadness in my eyes, remember when I came
In this music business, all their questions was insane
"Why you never smile in your pictures?" I refrain
From givin' you the answer 'cause that answer wasn't plain
Enough for me to see 'cause at the time I knew my name
But didn't know myself, and so I dealt with shit the same
As a fugitive, but running from the truth and shit
I shoot the shit with niggas, but they never knew the shit that's hidden deep
Within the crevices like ever since I was a child
Seen my mama with the pistol pointed at her dome and how
In the fuck do you expect for me to ever be the best lil' me
That I can be, when trauma's deep inside of me, like I.V. fluid Pumpin' through the blood of wifey, while she's givin' birth
To my child, I know my thoughts are runnin' wild
Bear with my style, this just a trial run
Just heard these kids don't know 'bout Malcolm
And I'm sort of heartbroken 'cause the elders lost hope in our youth
And here I sit dead in the middle, not a little boy no more
But not quite old yet, wakin' up in cold sweats
Scared that I'm too disconnected from the kids' perspective
The world ain't got no patience for some shit that's introspective So where in the fuck that leave me? Irrelevant, I guess
Went from Heaven-sent to hella bent, intelligent but stressed, damn
Yeah, it's Cole, won't lie, won't stop 'til the race is won
Niggas who be rapping how real they are
Usually turn out to be the fakest ones
Carolina, where I made it from
Cole world, no blanket, son
Girls fast how Jamaicans run
Puffing on the city where the Lakers from: L-A, L-A, la la
So high, everything is a “ha ha” for me
Dreaming of the days of a drop 500
And a bad bitch that'll go to Popeyes for me
You can never tell me that I'm not hungry
If you ever felt what's inside my tummy
My mind wondering now, is my time running out?
Is the Lord up top with a stop watch for me?
Hope not, hope not, hope not, hope not
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Yeah, just trying to make it, my nigga
(My world is empty without you)
A wise nigga told me don’t chase that cash
Follow your heart, you’ll make that fast
Does a stripper love to shake that ass
Or does she wish to erase that past?
Got a nigga in her face, just gassed
Like “baby girl, why you take this path?”
Stack in his hand, trynna make that last
All she thinking bout is how to take his last
Rub titties in his face and laugh
Gotta try not to look fake, in fact
A little more money, like a few more 20’s
When you let that nigga grab your naked ass
Okay, he’s gone now, roll her eyes when he whispers in her ear
“This ain't the life for you, baby, let me take you out of here cause..."
Yeah, she like "nigga, yeah right"
"You know how much motherfucking money I'm making?"
Yeah, my niggas sit back, blowing the L
Only getting high cause we closer to hell
Nigga trying to live like Hova, but well
We broke and that dough coming slow as a snail
Hustle hard in the snow, in the hail
Hit the block like a postman with mail
My brother got knocked now they hold him in cells
My mom broke, but she posted the bail
Someway, somehow
Nigga feeling like the sun down even when the sun up
Hear the sound out the window of the gun bust
And you wonder why niggas keep the gun tucked
But this how niggas was brung up
A mother just trying to raise her son up
'Til a stray bullet got his lungs struck
And the Governor couldn’t give one fuck
While she singing
Damn, told you niggas "Cole world, no blanket"
Tough luck, yeah
Yeah, aye wassup man? Aye, uh, aye look man, can I- can I get on- can I just get on this bus? All I got is a dollar fifty, I'm just sayin'. I just tryna get- I'm tryna get on the bus, man. I ain't got no mon- all I got is a dollar fifty, I don't go two dollars. Man, fuck you and yo' bus, nigga!
(Yeah)
Hey, hey (Yeah, got a dollar and a dream)
I got a dollar and a dream (Yeah), yeah
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, hey (Hey, I'm dreamin')
Ayy, ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems (Uh)
Niggas hating but I love them even though they trying to scheme
But I'm past that (Past that), a nigga's stock is rising like the Nasdaq (Uh-huh)
They say I’m the future but yet I’m giving niggas flashbacks
Of better days when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle, nigga, I say what they never say
Whenever they spit that bullshit they spittin'
This that pulpit, I’m hittin' niggas with the gospel (And the lord said)
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dollar in my pocket plus a dream
Yeah you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems
What it means to know your mama or your father on that pipe
On that hard white, I’ll tell you what them scars like
I’m speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail
Tired of siftin' through my mail, I feel like Cartwright, bills (Bills and bills and bills)
For real, a nigga ill
Just let me do the talkin', man, I know how niggas feel
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
(God damn, nigga. These motherfuckin' bill collectors, man)
(Can't even God damn turn on my phone without these nigga ringin' me up)
(They tryna call me from different numbers and shit. Tryna- tryna fool me, nigga. I'm Lil Cole, nigga!)
Yeah, got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems, yeah
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seem
Every lady ain't no ho and every bitch ain't no queen
Every nigga ain't no dog and every nigga ain't no king (Uh-huh)
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything
Every nigga can't dunk, some white man can jump (Haha)
They shootin' niggas 'fore they even tell 'em put their hands up
Crooked cops got a nigga scared to drive
Probably thinkin' that I’m slangin', man, I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dollar, plus a dream
Yeah, you swear your girl is faithful; everything ain't what it seems
See, I seen how she glance and looked away like she want it
I ain't sayin' I'ma fuck her, but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirt with a nigga, this is worse
I bet if I was to hit, man I wouldn’t be the first (Nah)
This is church, this is gospel (And the lord said)
Spit it like I get it from the Bible for your survival
Everything ain't what it seems (Yeah, ayy, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems (Uh-uh, uh, uh)
Ayy, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team (Wait 'til I get my money ri- hehehehe)
Yeah, I got a dollar and a dream, yeah, I got a dollar and a dream
(Wait 'til I get my money right, I'm dreamin')
Check it
Aye Sallie, I know I ain't been answerin' your calls (Aww, not this bitch, yeah)
But shit, let me explain- (I can explain, I can explain)
It's because times been hard
Been runnin' 'round tryna find a job (I can't get no job)
I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o’clock
And it's you (God damn), can't even front, I press ignore (Yeah)
I still got your letters layin' in my dresser drawer (Haha)
You tellin' me about all the things you did for me (I know, I know, I know, I know)
When I was broke, you sent me dough and that was big for me (I know, I know, big for me)
See you was there every year when I needed you
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my mama cosigned (Haha, yeah)
But in no time, a nigga graduated
I hit the real world, baby girl, I'm sad to say it
But I was usin' you, you gave a nigga major stacks (Major stacks)
And I know in my heart one day that I'm gon' pay you back
I got a dollar and a dream
I'll pay you back. Look, can we- can we set up some type of payment plan or somethin'? Like, you know what I'm sayin'? Like, you know? I just graduated six months ago so you know, times is kinda- times is kinda hard, baby. I- I just- can I just pay you like a lil' bit right now and then I pay you- I pay you the rest next- next month when I get paid. Can I just do somethin' like that? I gotta- I'm not even gon' lie to you, I don't, I don't really have it right now. I gotta pay how much? Five thousand dol- Aw, nigga is you crazy? Bitch you lucky I even answered the phone, I shouldn't have even picked up this motherfucker, I s- Look, what's ya- what's ya name? Can I- can I speak to a manager? You are the manager? Look, look can I speak to yo' manager? Who's- who owns this motherfucker? Let me talk to the owner! God damn it, I ain't- y'all niggas crazy... hahaha
La-la-la-laaaa, la lala la lalaaaa
Now I am (Here's to the Roc')
Hey and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
(Here's to Roc-a-Fella) It's the Fayettenam
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc')
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up
Now to the few niggas out there who heard my last shit
Which if I must say so myself that was a classic
I never been the type to ride my own coat tail
But it's obvious I'm here to stay, a fucking hotel
I came up, I warmed up
The next up, I blow up!
If you ain't peep the trend by now with each rap I go up
Look all he wanted was a deal so when he got it he just faded
But tell me what's a deal when you want to be the greatest?
So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone
Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne
Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone
Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time
I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger
And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder
But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo
Just switch my thoughts up like the stations on the radio nigga now I am
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall
Now may I never slip up or let my grip up
I know my girl be praying Lord just keep his pants zipped up -
Now if some groupie bitch is on his dick then make it's stiff up, at least give the nigga common sense to wrap his dick up
Toast, let’s lift up our glasses, then sip up
We fly past they look up
They don't last they give up
They don't blast we clip up then empty
And indeed we hit the target yes these niggas think they the shit and they ain't even farted yet
Style incomplete like a garbage ass quarterback
My offense is for real, ay fuck sack, niggas getting coffined in the Ville
Way too often and it feels wrong
New York niggas fuck with me, I got 'em singing Ville songs
Guess it's only right because we grew up singing they shit
Big shit, Mase shit, Nas shit, Jay shit
Time for a Carolina nigga to take his place with the greats
A slim nigga making bold statement
Uh, ay J. Cole how you do that there? I hear you blowing up my nigga
I'm like, true that yea
In NY but smile every time I flew back there
That Carolina, Fayettenam oh yea my crew back there
I go home been so long they saying, you back here? -
Took a turn for the worst boy don't move back here
Don't do that, yo who dat?
He rep the Ville when he spit it told you he be back with a record deal and he did it
Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie, I'm finna travel till 'refs blow the whistle on me
I got a whole fucking city that's just sitting on me
But it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that
Will I drop? I think not I get up while they stop-like a sleeve on tank tops
They ain't give it all they got so they flop
So hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot
Now I'm starting and they not-let me show you how to stay hot
I play not, man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog
The same nigga used to chill in the mall
While they were still in the mall, I was up there spilling my rap
The hero fighting villains just to put the Ville on the map
Yeah man so shit, this was The Warm Up
Um, what can I say, what can I say?
If you heard The Come Up that was about just a lil nigga from North Carolina man
Fayettnam to be exact
Moved to NYC, chasing the dream
I used college, if y'all niggas don't know, I used college as a tool to get to New York
I ain't have no family up here or nothing like that, I came up here on a scholarship, nigga went to college
And the whole time I ain't even think I would have to finish college, I just thought I'd be signed by my freshman year so I wouldn't have to finish college
But it didn't happen like that obviously, a nigga graduated and things started falling into place
I got more focused, I dropped The Come Up
And I look at The Come Up like, how kinda like how I was in high school
Just picture this, The Warm Up is about a nigga who did not make the team when he tried out and I know it's a lotta niggas who know that feeling man
You try out, you think you deserve to be one the team and you go that day to look at the cut-list
You wake up and you can't even sleep, you're like, "Damn I'm gon' make the team, I did my thing at tryouts."
You go to the list. All the niggas is looking at their names on the list, some niggas is like, "Aww shit I see my name nigga I'm good, I'm good nigga I'm good, I see my name."
And you're looking for your name, and you kinda play in the back, tryna wait for niggas to clear out cause you're not sure
And you go to the list and your name ain't there
And you're like, "How the fuck did I not make this team? I'm better than him, I'm better than him, I'm better than him."
So a lotta niggas either quit or some niggas go harder and so that's kinda how I took the rap shit when I put out The Come Up
Cause ever since I was 15 I thought I was supposed to be signed
But you know, shit, everything happens for a reason
So shit fast forward to The Warm Up, this just me, like you know, me being that nigga that's practicing and making sure it's no way, it's undeniable that when I go to tryouts, there's no fucking way the coach is passing up on me, my nigga
So that's what this whole mixtape was about and lo and behold, you know
As I'm finishing the mixtape, the deal comes
Thank God, I'm blessed. Everything happens for a reason. And it couldn't have been with a more fucking, with a better fucking squad
You know the niggas I got on the squad if you listen to this then you might have heard who I signed with, I ain't even gon' blast it off like that
Shoutouts to, you know, Mark Pitts, definitely
Shoutout to my nigga Mike Rooney, my nigga E, shoutout to my whole fucking crew, man
That's The Warm Up is about man
RG what's good, Mike Shaw, my nigga Mez, Mez held me down, nigga
More than anybody in the whole fucking, in the whole crew, honestly
So shit, let's get it, man
We got a lotta shit for '09, '010, '011, '0 goddamn 35
That's all I got man, that's The Warm Up
I made the team
So when you go from making the team, now what you gotta do nigga, you gotta start
You gotta be a starter, you gotta make it to college
You gotta make it from college to the league, nigga
Trust me, I ain't get no deal and fucking relax man
I feel like I ain't made it yet period nigga
And that's all I really gotta say yo, it's The Warm Up
Thank you for listening man
Yeah things change, things change
Things change nigga
Pick up the pen, time to write my sins away
Right my wrongs and then life goes on
Bitches be calling, then mistakenly niggas be falling
I fuck them and I leave them, forever picture me balling
With cash that I never had, I'm trying to stretch a million
Hoping it forever lasts, a fear of going broke
Cause most niggas I know can barely make the car note
Can barely keep the rent paid, so I'm like Da Vinci
Painting pictures to last centuries since like the 10th grade
Carolina nigga with New York plates
My template, switch states and swerve, mixtapes was served
Get cake, absurd, and has big plates, preferred
You heard, my every word
Potentially could free us all, now that's a heavy burden
Sometimes I'd rather get some head and watch my wealth grow
Cause things change, am I the same one you fell for?
One side screaming "hell no" other side holding on for dear life
Lately nigga I feel like, I ain't that young frail nigga that I used to be
Pardon my ways girl, I'm still getting used to me
Cause things change, I'm still getting used to me
I ain't that old shy nigga that I used to be
Bitches watching niggas plotting on me, truthfully
Gotta be careful what you wish for, as you can see
Things change
It's a real nigga revolution, real nigga revolution
It should not be televised
Now let me see them fucking
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
Diamonds, diamonds
Now on some sweet shit I want my kisses when I want them
On some freak shit I want my dick sucked when I want it
On some G Shit I got my chips up now I’m balling
On some Keith Sweat, I sang them bitches get to falling, on some Ville shit
Made to ball like a goalie net
On some real shit ain't set the time on my Rollie yet - foolish nigga
Always been the coolest nigga, way before you knew this nigga
I went to school with niggas, snatched they bitch then tutor niggas
My hoes smoke, I watch them, don’t roll the blunts I just cop them
Feed her shots of the vodka, she open up like a locker
She a bougie chick, seen every flick at the Oscars
She say I'm just like Sinatra, her pops is into the opera
Well look here my dear I’m the Pavarotti of rhymers
In a brand new Maserati how paparazzi gon’ find us
With my windows tinted like a limo, this is where I write my demo
Duckin' the devil you could say I live my life in limbo
(Cole World, I got it, I got it, I got it, listen)
You need a nigga that’s gon' come over and dig ya out
You need a nigga when he done probably gon' put ya out
You need a nigga that’s gon' put it in your mouth
Dick so big it’s like a foot is in yo mouth
And you ain't babysittin’, but my kids all on yo couch
And oh, you nasty, oh oh, you nasty
Both graduated, so fuck keeping it classy
Compared to Cole, boy, you’re softer than a sofa
And so far my new shit’s so fire
Nigga, check my profile
Who ya know make waves in the low tide?
Deebo’ed your bitch, now she both ours
Nigga, lil brown liquor in my liver
Pretty brown thang in my bed
So goddamn don’t make me beg
But I will if I need to cause forreal
Girl, I need ya
I could put ya on a flight, we could take off tonight
If you scared of heights, shit I got a pill I could feed you
Dear Mrs. Bill Collector
I know you just doing your job
Don’t mean to disrespect you
But we’ve been going through this thing since way back
I told you when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems baby yeah if you only knew
I got bigger problems baby, yeah, hey
So why you talking about the money that I owe
Like as if I didn’t know man
It don’t mean nothing to me
Cause right now I got my little boy crying
And my grandmother dying
Could you please stop fucking with me
Listen here, I ain't looking for no tears
But my brother got a year
And my Momma keep smoking that shit
On top of that, I’m broke
Please put that in your notes
For the next one to call me up talking that shit
And then ahana...
Dear, Mr. Policeman
Ay am I wrong, ain't you suppose to keep the peace man?
I coulda swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me fo'?
Is it this black Mercedes?
Oh naw I get it, I get it, I get it
Or cause I’m Black, hmmm maybe?
Yeah, hey, tell me why my hands start sweating
And I hold my breath every time that you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won’t hear a sound
Man I’m nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over, you frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me what do you see
Thug niggas, drug dealers, it's a trip
Every nigga in this whip gotta motherfucking college degree
And then ahana... unh
Yeah, my middle finger to the law
I'm busting off, tryna touch the sky
My teacher said impossible but I’mma fucking try
Plus how he gon’ tell me, he don't make the rules
There’s niggas dying every day man we don’t make the news
Instead they talking bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole
Top story: Tiger Woods be fucking all these White hoes
Anchorman stop snitching
Cut to commercial, he be texting all his side bitches
Hey my goodness, how ironic
On trial for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than a comet
Hey your honor, is you kidding
How you sit above me
Are you perfect motherfucker
How you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us?
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day you niggas just like us
You niggas just like us
On one hand, I'm happy for her
Because she smilin'
And I think about the times that she smiled for me
On the other hand, I'm bitter and well
Inside I'm dyin'
'Cause she loves him and she ain't got no time for me
And her new boyfriend is so clever
Over heard a couple of her friends tellin' her he better than me
And despite all the spite that builds with each passing night
I can't help but think they right
Because he never did cheat (Never did cheat, true)
And there is no excuse I can use
And there are no words I could say to make you believe
That I did this for us
Now I'm back on the mission
Tryna get what's mine
I gotta have her but this nigga here's in my way
What he don't know
From a 1 to 10 that girls a dime
No disrespect but when I met her dawg she was a four
I taught her everything she know
I fucked up, I ain't gon' lie
Tryna get a piece of that apple pie
Finally got a piece of that apple pie
I hit the road, came back home
Note on the table saying she was gone
Tears smear the words saying, "I can't wait"
Found somebody else hope it's not too late
We out in Abu Dhabi, we like to party
We don’t cause trouble, we just ride Bugatti
Bad chick shawty, sorta resemble Sade
Imported her in from Raleigh
And pulled up into the valet
The boy dropped the keys tryna sneak-a-peek at that body
See this that time of the week, she like to freek-a-leak and get naughty
Therefore I like to thank God and Ice Cube for Friday
Cause La-Di-Da-Di… (Cause we like to party)
Back where I belong
I’ve never felt so strong eh
Feeling like there’s nothing that I can’t try
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, high, hey
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, hey
This is my story this is my song
If you ain't got the heart, don’t attempt to try this at home
It’s just a poem from a man once living wrong
Now I’m in the zone, tell the World I’m coming home
Been a long time coming, been a long time coming
This song feel like the greatest of all time coming
Cause I do it B-I-G, I remember we would be high
Who’d have thought we’d be running rap when we was knee high
To appreciate the sun you gotta know what rain is
Or cause I’m famous you don’t gotta know what pain is
But I bounce back, would ya look at that
I take my spot at the top and I ain't looking back
Hey, confusion like I was losing my mind
But one thing I never lose is my grind
My closet need a lot of cleaning now
I can’t sleep cause I dont like the shit I dream about
Hey Dear Lord please help me get the demons out
And then help me get my genius out
And get back to what I had
If my good’s outweigh my bads, do you think my mistakes is gon even out (even out)
I guess try and see, it’s on my diary, I’m living for my kids
Now they is just as fly as me
Talk well, wonder if Andre Harrell knew how great I would be when he fired me
Almost
Hm
So here we are
So here we are, it's funny how so close can seem so far
Seem so far
Seem so far, funny how so close can seem so far I mean
Nigga, this is your moment
Damn, this is your moment
Damn, this supposed to be your moment, ain't it?
This supposed to be your moment
This supposed to be your moment!
What good is being the one when you the only one that knows it?
Damn we got bitchez, and they bring bitchez
Fuck all y'all niggas, y'all niggas bitchless
This is dedicated (yo turn my vocals up)
You know who this is dedicated to
Me and my niggas fuck all the bitchez
Where did your bitchez go?
They say grief is the price of love, fuck love!
I'm out in D.C. what's the price of love, I'm tryna
Get into something like a virus
Get lucky like I'm Irish
Born broke I'mma die rich
Steve Jobs of the projects
Pete Rock with a South twist
When the beat drop nigga drop heat
Like a teapot
Nigga eavesdrop on the knowledge
Once again it's on
A nigga cash never been this long
A nigga passion ain't been this strong
I'm in the zone
Known to slang dick like it's ten inch long
Open wide get my bid'ness on
Young Dennis get my menace on
No O-Dog more like more Caine
Get dough, fuck hoes that's a full life thing
'06 I was po' like rain
Flow sick and I don't like lames
Stop playing, bitch
Yeah, now, here's the memo
I'm a rebel without a cause, a bezel without no flaws
And shawty, you straight
Bet you look way better without no drawers
Let's sweat out this alcohol (Yeah), bet I'm about to ball
And never let up, look how I just crept up without applause
Fed up with all the frauds and left y'all without a job
The center of attention, this is clever, I'm Pau Gasol
Really, though, I'm LeBron, really don't got my mind
On this new school of rappers, I will really go Columbine (Uh-huh)
And throw up the diamond sign (Uh-huh)
Boy you know I'ma shine (Uh-huh)
Flow is in Ramadan (Uh-huh)
'Cause couple years ago, the game had they pajamas on (Yeah)
But now they on my dick, man, I should throw a condom on
Ayy, 'cause a nigga coming raw like I ain't got one on
And I ain't stopping nor copping no pleas
I just lock-and-load, squeeze
Dog, I'm on a higher level, I'm on top of nosebleeds (Damn)
Niggas say they sick, but when they rock, they don't sneeze
Like the nigga on the block waving his Glock, but won't squeeze
Please... Hey
Now hol' on, hol' on, hol' up
Has anybody seen Jermaine? (No)
Jermaine
Where's Jermaine Cole?
He does this all the time...
Naw, I'm just saying like, I'm just trynna see you, you know what I'm saying? What you was doing after this
Naw, I stay not too far from here, like right down the street-yea like right there
Baby you summertime fine
I'll let you get on top, I'll be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number 9, dime
I guess I met you for a reason only time could tell, but well
I'm wondering what type of shit you on
Do you like the finer things or are you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed?
Done be ashamed, it ain't no thang, I used to blow trees
Getting lifted
I quit the shit, I might get high with you
It's only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you
A flower you, a powerful, you do something to me
Cause girl I caught the vibes
Like you threw something to me-so I threw em back
Now all my niggas hollering "who is that?
Oh boy she bad nigga, what you bout to do with that?"
I'm finna take you home sip a little Patron now we zoning
Baby you so fine
Ay can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
The sun rising while you moaning
Yea, yea now are you shy or is you freaky lady?
Are you shallow cause if not I'll take it deeper baby
Tell me what turns you on
You like the slow songs?
You like some candles lite?
That ain't really my style
But see I planned a trip
And yea we both coming
Just tell me how you want it
I give it to you like I owe you something
When I'm on it, on it like my job
I'm hoping I confess
This life gets hard I can take away your stress if you let me
You knew just what this was when you met me
So let your guard down girl
I'll take your bra down girl and undress ya
Real slow yea I'll make you feel special
I can feel your heart beating fast
From the passion, ya hands reaching for the sheets to grab
And now ya leaking, freaking ain't no speaking but you moaning!
Ya so fine I got to give it to you
I got a slight obsession-of watch your face while ya moaning
Do you like caressing or do you like aggression?
You the fighting, wrestling, biting pillows
Do you want it in the dark or while the lights is still on?
I'm fantasizing in my mind bout how your body feel
While we sweating you dripping wet from what your body spill
Now if your nervous and hesitant just let it go
See baby lately seems my life been hell and heaven knows
That you looking like an angel-sent from the heavens, God bless your every angle
Got a nigga tangle in your spider web
I'm doing shit I never might of did
And I ain't stopping baby even if the light is red
Your body's right as rain
So where the hydroplane
That ass is fat baby ain't no way to hide your frame
Thank God I found you
Just holla when you want it
Cause girl your so thorough
Need y’all niggas to feel me, yo
Feel my pain
Said soft niggas can’t last hard times, yo
Believe that shit
Yeah, (Yeah) aye (Aye)
Real niggas don’t cry
Look, yo
Was just a youngin’ with that fresh fade
Bird chest, legs skinny
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny
Fresh pennies on my feet
Momma paid for everything I’m wearing
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world
Aw nigga, but shit done changed since Maine was my nickname
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game
Now I’m a man worried about my fam
Let me explain
It’s like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shit’s sprained
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle
You feeling like the world’s on your back so you stumble
In the field like a quarterback get sacked, then you fumble
Jobs don’t call a nigga back, so it’s back to the hustle
Niggas praying for they moms, the same time they moms pray for them
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way
But damn a nigga been a lost faith
It hurts on the usual
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral (damn)
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain, my nigga
I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow
But I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that, I’m aiming for the stars, my nigga
I won’t stop, try ‘til the day I die
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry, no
(ay, ay, ay, yea)
(listen, yo)
I sit back and watch the news every now and then
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash
Even the weather’s bad
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted
Like, “Damn it’s ’06 and niggas still up on that gang shit?” (that shit old, dawg)
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen, he was finna to graduate in like three weeks, some stupid niggas got him for his chain
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement, uh (rest in peace)
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped
Some dude snatched her, she was standing at the bus stop
Wait, man she was eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world?
Got these grown niggas fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us
Every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain, (right)
They killed her only son
Now she wanna blow her brains out
Change the channel man, I can’t watch this shit
And I won’t cry, no, I can’t cry
Take a ride through the city man, tell me what you witness
Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits
Violence, hatred, real devastation
Neighborhoods looking like there’s still segregation
Welfare, single mothers, no jobs
Tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie
Fiends in the street so high off of that crack shit
This nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress (bang!)
White folks got the road to success mapped and that’s all good
But why don’t blacks got that same atlas?
I asked the same question a million ways
And it seems like I done prayed for a million days
But still the ills remain, just bills and pain
Shootouts in project buildings, children slain
Skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why
It's enough to make a nigga wanna cry, but I can’t though
Yeah, shit dedicated to my cousin Ricky man
Hoop dreams cut short man
Learned he had a baby on the way
Nigga wasn’t even a senior in high school, though
Hold your head man
I live round here, I live round here
Look at the strength!
Bright lights, Big dreams
Nice night or So it seems
Stroll in the club with her tight fit jeans
Praying that she might get seen by a nigga with a contract
With a sports team or just a nigga that you figure could afford things
Like more rings for her fingers
She used to fuck singers but said they too soft, Just copped a new loft
For you walk into her crib got to take her shoes off
Thats only step one your dress is next hun
You say your kid sleep, I don't want no step son
But lead the way to your bed room, king size bed so we got leg room
She give Queen like head so we got head room, my God
Than I work her like its my job
Her moans is like music to my ears iPod
And than I hit the door, cause baby I got to go
Oh yeah don't act like you don't know
I know you've been through this before
Check it, I make the rich bitch beg
Make the good girl steal
Make the old ladies blush
Make the young hoes squeal
For real, for real
Good girl huh, father was a preacher
Sent her off to college thought he got her on a leash though
From the outside man them girls be the squeakiest
You get 'em inside them girls be the freakiest
Mischievous, downright devious
Say she want cake I got all the right ingredients
Running round fronting like a pure white virgin
Gave a nigga dome while her father gave a Sermon
Amen, let the choir sing
She be walking round campus like the quiet thing
Some niggas scared to approach when they admiring
Man if they know like I know she got that fire thing
Pour a little OJ with some P-trone
I'm feeling ok, but homie she's gone
When remmy Rev called she just ignore him
I had her calling on God 'til the wee morn
And than I hit the door nigga
Cause baby I got to go
"That was the warm up, that was the warm up, baby
Aight, Elite, for real, one take, dawg, and I'm up outta here
One, yup, yeah."
Lord, please forgive me for my sinning
I ain’t saying that I’m finished, but I’m praying in advance
Cause the way her eyes glance like they playing in my pants
Yeah, ball game
I swear the hoes wasn’t in my plans when a nigga took the chance and came to the big city
My beat machine the only fucking thing I had with me
Like Bobby had Whitney, we was cooking up crack
But them fifteen credits had a nigga off track
Picture that, best rapper since Lil Wayne in classes
The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his bachelor’s
But mastered this rap shit
You hear the words coming from my lips bastards
I never crack, I got that Chapstick
I practiced till that shit made perfect and served it to the people on a silver platter
Now where’s the ladder?
Cause either you gonna whine or you climb; I chose the latter
Know you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though
‘Fore you get tossed like a forward lateral
We never tattle, let God handle that
Or let the mob handle that
No Soprano, half black, half white; I’m a piano
I’m an animal, my video on Discovery Channel
I’m a beast when my shit hits the streets, these niggas cease to exist
Like a beach in a tsunami, you'll find me in the ‘Ville
In the state of NC
Bitch, if I ain’t back home, I’m up in NYC
‘Bout that money prob-ly like a fucking robbery
But I ain’t jacking
I’m chasing dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slacking
Hey, take a hard look at my drive nigga, no hacking on my shit
I’m straight smacking niggas, straight tagging niggas
Yo, I freestyle and fuck you niggas, ya’ll be wilding and I’m out
Fresh off the mother fucking broadcast
And I'm here, fuego nigga
Yeah, hey, uh, it's happening fast
I told niggas on the low, they ain't hear it though
Boy that man in the mirror is a miracle
Hey wipe your face, momma told you no more tears would flow
We eating better than we was a few years ago
Sent you Western Union on my pay day, a week later it's mayday
So you returned the favor, we stayed afloat like some sailors
Bill collectors blowing us up, they couldn't fade us
Bitch I made straight A's, go ahead, and try to degrade us, haters
But this one's funny: man one year later I was on them phones
Collecting money, a lesson from me: everybody's got a story dog
Unfortunately learned I can't do nothing for you dog
I'm trying to run the whole game like a morning jog
With hits like a porno blog
Not hopping out the shower to make ten dollars an hour
Ain't judging though, to each his own
You pay your bills and raise your kids inside a decent home
More power to you
But a message to you fuck niggas
I hope your kids grow up and never wanna fuck with you
This punk nigga knocked up two hoes at the same time
And told this nigga they was lying dog, they ain't mine
That's cold blooded but ain't nothing new
Same old, fuck it though, what's up with you?
If you made it this far listening without skipping
Then I gotta show love, don't worry I'm just venting
The late night thoughts of a nigga on a mission
And I rock my girl to sleep in missionary position
Tuck that ass in and then I went and grabbed a pen
And now you have it, words flowing like magic, it's truly accurate
You niggas posing like some hoes up in a beauty pageant!
Nobody touching me, it's like I got the cooties rapping
Remember when we called niggas African booty scratchers?
Yeah that was random, but man so is life
You grab your needle, grab your thread, and hope you sew it right
I find myself fiending for a spot to go at night
With the liquor flowing steady and the hoes polite
The fast lane makes me reminisce on slower life
The unabomber, bitch I'm blowing up overnight (BOOM!)
Hey, yo, it's happening fast (Fast)
I say it's happening fast (Fast)
All the drama that I had to get past
Will it last? Or will it pass? (Pass)
Just as quick as it came (Came)
Hoes knowing my name (Name)
Dog, welcome to fame
I pray to God we don't change (Change)
But even if you don't
Most niggas look at you strange
But I guess I can't complain (Hey)
Hey man it's happening fast (Fast)
Fresh ass nigga, no wonder why them hoes be open
That’s that nigga, so what'd I say? They okey-dokin'
How you figure? You fuckin' wit' me? I hope he jokin'
I'm witcha girl, you home alone, bitch you Macauley Culkin
I'm oviedosin', ayy, homie, Cole be smokin'
Then put my ashes on you niggas, bet you gon' need lotion
I'm slowly roastin', heatin' up so you know we toastin’
Fuck hoes wit' no emotion, fade away like Kobe postin'
Out in Sweden like ain't shit that you can't tell us
Lord forgive me, as a kid, I used to look at niggas jealous
Cause uh, they had them J's and my mama wouldn't cop 'em
Can you blame her? 100 dollars for them bitches want a option
Now we livin' much better, nigga pay whatever
Rock them bitches once then forgot about 'em forever
My kicks like my chick, I don't need to know the numbers
You just need to know I'm comin', I'll kill you niggas this summer
Game on lock, she ain't stepping on this bus if she ain't gon pop
I ain't walking in the jeweler if i ain't gon cop
Stole Mase flow just to say i ain't gon stop,
Who made the beats hot? CL or Pete Rock
Shit or was it a perfect marriage
Me I'm both in one my beats got me the chain
My raps bought me this Range, my diamond chain the clearest
Funny how a youngin, I never liked carrots
But now I'm older and I'm eating better, which means
Less beef and more cheddar, more bread, more lettuce
Was always fucking dimes but nowadays more let us
From a world where love was just four letters, a go getta
My shows better, my flows better
A go getta rarely do i do better
I'm too set in my ways I'm too gutter to change
Should have known that I'm the coldest I'm two letters away
Nigga who better than Jay? From the the the Roc
Not HOV though its Cole yo
Niggas taking pictures every time I'm in the store yo
When I hit the club they be snapping on the low yo
Niggas snapping pictures every fucking where i go yo
Sometimes i be mad as shit
Then I say stupid motherfucker boy you asked for this
Oh yeah I did, didn't I, did it big, didn't I
Made my album sell like it did a bid, didn't I
Check the album credits that's produced and written by
None other then yours truly
I'm bored sue me, I'm all on the Billboards I'm tryna make Forbes sue me
Audio visual nigga, I could score a movie
You couldn't score a bucket, I'm aiming at Warren Buffett
And painting my poorest fuck it, it rains and it pours
I'm covered out on these tours, running a train on your whore
Take her home in a Ford, ironic 'cause I explore
Nigga I explore!
Prophecys fulfilled, as i proceed to kneel
Dodging greed of niggas who cock and squeeze to steal
I do this for my niggas that got degrees and still broke as fuck
Fuck your flag, democracy has failed
I'm in the realest state with no properties for sale
Probably could build with Socrates himself
No soccer moms to throw us on soccer teams but still
Kick shit so cold boy, I can freeze in hell
Now do tell exactly how does it feel
Tryna save a generation knowing that you never will
Tryna do rap without some nigga tryna pay your bills
Cause you black and rap you'll never do no numbers like Adele
Oh well Momma already been through hell
I could turn this into heaven if my records even sell
I'm a firm believer if you never quit you never fail
If I slip I grab the rail, I'll get a grip and never fail
Falling victim to this society, wheres hoes gaining notoriety
And if I ain't rocking chains these kids won't admire me
Niggas try extorting me to get a verse up out of me
Nigga eat dick your street shit don't apply to me
I walk around dolo no security YOLO
So if a nigga plan to put a bullet through my polo
Cause i wouldn't help his promo so be it
Kill you niggas without licking a shot, this cold war, Soviet
No Vietnam, back in Fayettenam. no stay at home moms
We was far from street niggas but we played along
Walk around with our mean mugs painted on
Rest in peace to all the teen thugs
May the lord bless your soul
Cross the crossings this must be called life
Momma stressed she been stressing all night
But momma your little bundle of joy
Is clever enough to avoid the pitfalls of this world they destroyed
This is clever nigga i never seen another nigga
Momma, I just killed a man
My body still trembling, can you feel my hand?
Don’t shed no tears, it won’t be long before they find out it was me, Momma
This may be the last time you see me free, Ma, don't spend it crying
You did your best, me, I was blessed, know you were stressed trying
To keep me out the streets, me, ducking police
Trying not to make a peep to wake you up out your sleep
A drunk and high fool
Skipping class, flunking high school
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned
Said I was playing with fire, somehow I never burned
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed
You tried to show me right, but somehow I never turned
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you 'shamed of me?
Dry your face off, Mommy, you're not to blame for me
See, I’m a man, I gotta take whatever came for me
At times I wonder ’bout my father, would it change for me if he was around?
Would I still be running 'round with the lowlifes?
Bum ass niggas no jobs, no life
Seen them niggas kill for no price
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light
I pulled the trigger, Momma
Tryna be hard, I ain't mean to kill the nigga, Momma
But what’s done is done
I’m on the run, I live my life like a movie now it’s way too realer
Who would've thought your baby boy would've grew up to be a killer?
Yeah, now I’m a killer
Guess I’m a killer
They got me in here with the killers
Yeah, I mean the killers
Yeah, I wonder what's in store for me, lately been stressing
Pray for blessings, hope that there’s more for me than just a simple life
Niggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life
Gave up the jump shot, worked on the gunshot
Who woulda thought? I used to block this nigga's lay-ups
Now he’s in a cell layed up
I wish you well, stay up like insomniacs
This life can make a nigga fold like a laundry mat, uh
I sip this cognac, though
To ease my brain from all this pain and so that I react slow
In this fast world, slow niggas, fast girls
Ho's give up ass while these ho niggas hold triggers
Blast on ‘em, hold up that old checker flag for ‘em
Chalk lines by the do not walk sign, it’s deep
All these cold hearted niggas holding heat
I’d rather blast before they steal a nigga
Tell ‘em now boy, don’t make me turn into a killer, nigga
Yeah, into a killer
Don’t make me turn into a killer
Yeah, to a killer, yeah yeah
To those who had love for me in the past
Who woulda ever thought that time would fly by so fast
I remember back in class we used to make believe
Like it was draft day, swore that we would make the league and be rich
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, aw shit
Watch how they pile up, seem like a mile up
I washed the blisters on my hands and then I'd dial up
My best friend, skating rink is where we headed at night
And if a nigga disrespect, oh yes, we ready to fight
In retrospect that shit seem petty, at the time the shit was heavy
'Cause life was all about your name
You had to scrap with any nigga that would call you lame
Ashamed no doubt, so many niggas got their brains blowed out
Snatch a niggas chain and he got his name wrote out
In obituaries, another body in a cemetery
Another young nigga in the penitentiary
And he don’t give a fuck: no missionary
Rap visionary, paint a picture, nigga: Pictionary
Tell you what it is, I’m a dictionary
I knew a nigga threw his dick in e'ry chick in e'ry
City that he went to, went hard like the rent due
'Til he met the wrong bitch
Her man just came home, ex-convict
And he stay on with that Thriller
Shit, fucking around with them killers
Yeah, with them killers
Fucking around with them killers
Say I’m a killer
It's hard to picture a nigga not getting money
J. Cole living bummy? Hahaha that shit is funny
I’m focused on that cash, I just laugh at them bastards
Eligible bachelor, finna get my Bachelor’s
And if this rap shit don’t work, I’m going for my Master’s
Still scouting hoes on the first day of classes
Keep up with the asses, keep up with the grades
A nigga straight A’s like the Braves
She got me in her dorm room, talking bout her room ain’t clean
And she wanna fuck, but wait until her roommate leaves
Now I could give a damn if her roommate seeing
Cuz if the girl get excited, she’s invited. (haha)
If it's alright with you, yea, shit, then it's alright with me
If it's alright with you baby girl, then it's alright with me, (uh)
And if it's alright with you shawty, then it's alright with me
Hey and if it's alright with you, (yea, yea) then shit, it's alright with me
Yeah, uh, I hate to brag, well naw, I don’t, the big man on campus
I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga glances
And if your ass is dumb you won’t even get a chance
Cuz I gotta chick in every class that give a nigga answers, yea
And if I hit ya shorty, keep it on the low
This shit just like highschool, people wanna know
I see you haters mad, but I ain’t mad at y’all niggas
We get ass like them basketball niggas, I’m ballin’
Got a sidekick so them hoes don’t be callin’!
Hit me on aim, ay what’s your screen name?
When I start typing in, a nigga’s got some mean game, yea
And when I whip it out, shit she gonna think she seeing things, but
Back in Carolina I miss home badly, (yea)
It’s funny hoes I couldn’t have is tryna bag me
But I’m in the Jeep with this freaky ass Aggy
She said she want it from the back, gladly
I’m skipping class just to get some ass, living fast
And college with no sleep nigga, my jabs quick as Zab's
So kill that old college gangsta shit we dont believe
You mad cuz your girl on Facebook poking me, so uh
You know the G, I hit her up like “Hello Elle
I see you looking right the other day, LOL
So, what’s good with you?”
She hit me right back like “Shit, what’s good with you?”
You know I like that, so of course I write back
Hit her with some nice chat
Same night she in my room, lights off I strike that
Yea I put game right, but that’s your wife, nigga take her
I bust then I kick her ass out to write a paper, yea (hahaha)
A nigga doing homework, drinking like a fish
It ain’t a weekend that I’m sober
Fighting hangovers on my way to my internship
And I forgot to study for my midterm, shit!
Hahahaha, wooo!
Ay, this is straight through, nigga
No, no fucking, no double takes
This is straight through the whole shit nigga
Check it out man, tryna tell y’all niggas man
College is a good look
A real good look, my nigga
For more reasons than one, man
Know they try to keep us out of that shit though
That shit like extra expensive
I got scholarships though, so you know I’m not sweating that
I feel for my niggas that couldn’t make it man
Ay Mike we in there baby, hahaah
Ay they can’t, they can’t keep us out the G my nigga, you know
Then we all make it, nah, we ain’t all make it
Shout out to my niggas, man
All my niggas, yo
Whether you graduated or not
Whether you made it to college or not, nigga
Fayettenam, yeah, yeah
Class of 2007 man
Holla at me
I’m going to grad school though, you know?
Yeah yeah yeah
Elite Elite Elite, Elite
Ya know
Slim nigga, lyrically on my limbs
Bigga then a nigga hittin' the gym
Regular benchpressin' the bar
Ten steps up from ya'll, you could follow my lead
If you shoot for the stars, I guess you aimin' at me
But please hold your applause
Ya'll holdin' up the wall goddammit I'm on the flo'
Good Lord, can't you see me gettin' down on a ho
And she drop it so low she sittin down on the flo'
I never pound with the flo, at times I wonder
Aye when they listen to my shit man can they hear my hunger?
Or will these hatin' ass rappers try to steal my thunder
Aye this is big shit poppin', you gon' need a plunger
To take me under, niggas in trouble
You lookin' at LeBron James of the game
I could do anything that you name
I could blaze any rapper in the game that you bring
Pour gasoline on the brain, got the flame for that
So you hatin' niggas refrain from that
A little bitter cause yo game is whack
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah
Aye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me
I know it won't be long 'fore you hear about me
My head's to the sky and I'm on my grind
I'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine
Take what's mine
A dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So, if it's 'bout that C.R.E.A.M, then I'm all up in the spot
I'm just warmin' up, I'm hot but nah, I ain't flashin'
I never gave a fuck about no high-end fashion
And maybe I was too broke, maybe I'm just too dope
To rap about that regular shit, or bag a regular bitch
These niggas talkin' like they on the next level and shit
But Cole's flow so cold, Bet the devil get sick
How do you want it? So sick I make you mentally vomit
These rappers askin' for beats and they ain't even fit to be on it
I see 'em writin' about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach
Because they talk 'bout the future but didn't mention me on it
So now I'm back in the kitchen, cookin' I'm meant to be one of the greatest
No niggas seein' me, this century us and you hate it
Look how I played it, other niggas was jaded
Under-appreciated, now Carolina is rated
I let Elite breathe, yeah
Hey, uh uh uh
You ever prayed for something your whole life?
I mean, all you dreamed about was this one thing
I mean, you know it’s coming
You have faith and all that
But sometimes
Sometimes you second guess yourself
That’s human nature I suppose, second guessing
When life seems to take you through more downs than ups
Seems like it gives you more losses than wins
But do you stand tall and be bold
Or do you fold?
Do you believe?
See, me, I came a long way
Way too far for me to stop now
Not that I would stop anyways, but
I’m so close, I can feel it
Can you feel it?
Warm Up
Yeah, hey, look
When she talk she so closed-minded
All she wanna do is shop, she so clothes minded
Wanna cop the latest 'fore them other hoes find it
Material girl yet somehow I don't mind it
Probably 'cause she so fine it'll blow your mind
She black and Pocahontas, laid back and blow that chronic
Ass so fat, wanna tat my logo on it
So any other nigga that a tap will know it's mine
I put in work overtime
Let me cut, mow the lawn, guarantee I blow your mind
She tried to play me 'til she learned I wrote a rhyme
"That's that nigga from the Ville that I heard that Hova signed
The rap form Lebron, oh girl, that boy the bomb
No chain around his neck, but better watch out for the charm"
You're not my daughter, um, but you can be my baby
Summertime, wintertime, anytime we looking for them ladies
Ladies, yeah
Ayy with your fat ass booty and your perty ass weave!
Beautiful ladies, yeah
Now I ain't tricking, but I got a couple tricks under my sleeve
Now clap your hands one time if you know you look good
All you ladies, yeah
Now if you from the suburbs or the hood (Yeah, ayy, look)
Beautiful ladies
She said "I got a man", well, baby I don't give a fuck
See me I understand, and I ain't tryna split you up
Okay, give me your number and later I'ma hit you up
If you sleep I get you up, ride over and pick you up
If it's clean I'll lick you up, yeah, do you research
I'll rock that ass to sleep and have you sleeping in my t-shirt
Just came home from getting my South Beach on
You know I ran the streets like a dog without a leash on
She tryna get her freak on, come hop up on this ski jet
You scared of that water or you just scared to get your weave wet?
Barely got your feet wet, yes, I know where we headed
Tryna see you throw it back, let's check your reflexes
Good Lord, didn't know what I was in for
You could be my cuddy buddy, baby, what are friends for?
I speed up the tempo, them other niggas lazy
Can't fuck with nuttin' younger than the eighties
I'm grown and I'm looking for some ladies, ladies, yeah
Yeah, The Warm Up
Lemme stretch out
They say I'm the down south Nas, the east coast Pac
The Carolina Andre, the Fayettenam Kanye
So join it, can't beat it, to all the nonbelievers
If you missed it, I'll repeat it, I'm the light skinned Jesus
Here's my thesis for them niggas with them pieces like Reese's
We ballin' while we winking at your bitch up in the bleachers
She fiending just to hop up on my shit like she was featured
On that piece of shit, bed keep on squeaking like some sneakers
On the court, here's some lines you can snort, food for thought
Here's a fork, no pork, damn it, keep it pure, organic
What's the score? Lord, it's a blowout
You niggas out here shoutin', but see me, I'm just gon' show out
Bitch, it's destiny, no doubt, niggas testing me more but I'm sure
Look homie I know my shit can give a tour of the sewer
I'm bored, this shit is simple, on instrumentals I'm Kimbo
Slicing on any tempo, I'm busting like many pimples on the temple
Go hard like I just seen some nipples on Beyonce
No disrespect to Hov, but if I didn't I'd be beyond gay
Almost erased them lines but in the end I chose to keep 'em
'Cause if I said it, I really, I really
I really mean it, yeah
And that's just a Warm Up baby
Lemme give it to 'em
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look, nigga
I rep my city in your city
Just to let you niggas know just where I'm comin from
Ville' nigga troublesome
Gats all around niggas waist like a cummerbund
Leave you leakin' 'til the plumber come
Still we ain't running from no man
Look bitch I'm hot enough to melt a snowman
Ey pack your bags mama we gettin the fuck up outta Po' land
Cause I'm programmed for the dough
While you hold hands with a ho
You ain't got no chance when I flow
Bitch I was a grown man when I was four
Boy, so sit your ass down
You lookin at the class clown
Slash valedictorian, slash hoopin nigga best dressed
Back in school you was just a stupid nigga
And now you're rappin all you talk bout your Coupe is sicker
Your top is dropped but the cops is out here shootin niggas
Stupid nigga, see me I rather tell the truth to niggas
You out here stuntin, niggas is out here frontin
Nigga you good for nothin
I'm freestylin coming off the dome
Bitch Macaulay Culkin Home Alone
I don't even know why I said that
And bitch I get bread that's enormous
Ya'll niggas on my dick man I'm dormant
That means I'm on the low, that means I'm on your ho
That means I'm about this dough
Nigga I'm coming off the dome
Bitch I'm I'll all the way to the chromosomes in my body
Bitch get hit with a 12-gauge shotty
No Maserati, driving like Mr Cosby
Nigga know
I'm coming through I got the sicker flow
I've hit them motherfuckin niggas with that
Nigga know that drunk shit I'll shit
Comin through I spill shit like whoops, bitch
You need to read a book bitch
(Fade Out with J. Cole still rapping)
Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I do
Give me this good, what can I say?
I just don’t know, my love ain't no trip for the weekend
Here to stay for all of the seasons
You’re the weakness that I can’t control
Baby you all I need to get by
You’re fly, so you’re all I need to get high
You got it? Uh, so put ya number in this camera phone
And we can live like the camera’s on, no script though
These boys claiming they ball, got no grip though
My flow switch mode, it’s so schizo
So I’m the one that your girl blow a kiss for
You've gotta love me, Cole World, no Snuggie
Baddest girls hug me, my mind on you though
You’re hoping I’m the one
But I already knew though
It ain’t no secret that I get around, true
But girl, you make me want to settle down with you
Get a crib with a view, lay up in the bed, make a kid, maybe 2
All my ex-girlfriends gon' have to get a clue
Cause the rumors that you heard about is true
Maybe I'd be better off in Hell
(Better off in Hell)
(Can't call it, can't call it)
(I never came from deep pockets)
(Why can't I make a deposit?)
(I can't call it, uh! I can't call it)
Uh, so far I done, uh, yeah, so far I done
Okay, so far I done managed to take advantage
I set a goal and of course it ain't take off like how I planned it
Granted, I want the globe and the planet where my hands is
Granted, I'm on my toes and I'm sick of standing
Sick of the bicker back and forth
The lifted pitch inside your voice
Cause I can't afford a picket fence and a porch
If I get in a pickle, I pull the pistol out my shorts
Payback on a pussy boy, so give me mines and give me yours
Give me time and let me finish to design the method
Enemy, the line, I stepped it
Point me in the wrong direction
Digging in the mind connecting
Everything I ever seen, ever done
Never was trying to set the gas to the fire
I prepped it, walking in shit that I stepped in
Yea
We fresh off-mutherfuckin South Beach
Yea, uh
Sometimes play the villain, sometimes play the hero
Sometimes I be Dilla, sometimes I be Preemo
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego
Other times a nigga swim around like Nemo
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond
Pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn
I get my weight up, inflate up
And make these old niggas open the gate up
At the mansions that they laid up in
Like, "Hello my name is Cole" - I'm walking right up in and well known
Don't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch
And I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL
A few chicks want to text "let's chill"-how obvious
Girls from all over the world is my hobby
And I got a chick who stay in DC like a lobbyist
My old chick from Raleigh that I still like to parley with
Just to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent
The moans turn to screams, I can feel her climaxing
Now if you faking that baby you need to try acting
Hollywood shit, had a nigga feeling like the milkman
Deliver that through the body good dick
Feeling like I got game that Karate couldn't kick
Therefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up
I'm a talk until you tell me shut up
Uh, and we can walk the beach until the sun up
Huh, I ain't gon lie I'm trynna get some cut up
Ay, so what up
Hey, you heard that huh?
Oh you ain't heard of me well I prefer that
Uh, I text my number to you did you get that?
Huh, well when you lonely baby you can hit back
And I'll fix that
Tell me is you with that, hey
Ay tell me is you with that
Ay tell em is you with that
Yea, ay baby is you with that? Yea
Big K.R.I.T., my nigga, I feel your shit
Been feelin' your shit since Felton put me on
I put him on Dot, he put me on K.R.I.T.  
Was here since then, nine years have gone
I wrote more songs than a man can count
Tryna figure out how to put 'em out
Without waterin' down my brand
I don't want 'em to not want my jams
Don't wanna become something that nobody wanna hear
But I recognize this as a bitch-ass fear
Why the fuck do I care if I ain't got your ear?
Then I ain't revered, if I ain't revered, then why am I here?
What if these songs you refuse to share
All due to the fact that you're insecure
Coulda helped somebody out there like you
See the world more clear, let me switch gear
Allow me to use this feature
To shout out one of the first fans that a nigga ever had named Felicia
I was brand new to the game, wasn't used to no fame
So it was unusual when I would land in a city and see you at baggage claim
Come to find out you was workin' for Delta
So you got to fly for the free and that means
That I was seein' you like every show
At first, it felt weird, but you was just so
Casual 'bout it and not some over-the-top fan
And that was just lettin' me know
"I really fuck with you, Cole"
Today I saw you post some terrible news as I scroll, so
This one is for you, want you to pull through
I better see you on the road
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, and on the count of three, baby girl
Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, hey
And on the count of three, Blow up, Blow up
Yeah, and that I will, nigga, that I will
I keep a checklist of rappers that I'mma kill
I used to play the bleachers before I had a deal
Now a nigga gettin burnt, just imagine how that feel
Hmm, ill, fantastic
Flip rhymes, flip beats, nigga, "Jam"nastics
Your style hot now, but they just can't last with
Something like the rap sand-castle
Gone with the tide, I'm here for the seasons
Bend yo' ass over bitch I'm here for a reason
Cold breezin', flow freezin'
This ain't spittin' ho, I'm sneezin'
Used to hit South Beach, stay at the Parisian
No fun nigga, low funds was the reason
Old school bed that the hoes got pleased in
Now them Lowes doors, is what I throw keys in
Man, talk about a come up
Niggas see me in the street they talk about 'The Come Up'
Or talk about 'The Warm Up'
Or "Nigga, when your album drop?"
And why these lil' rappers like to run their mouth alot?
And J. Cole, are you really from the south or not?
I see your jeans, man them thangs, must have cost a lot
Aye do you get a chance to hang out with the boss a lot?
Even them hating niggas like you at the barbershop
Cole.. Yeah, that's my muhfucking name
Nigga couldn't even watch the All Star game
Had to do the whole Valentines Day thang
Gotta play the game, so my lady won't complain
Three or four days, I be back on a plane
Do a couple shows, where the people know my name
Look man, the crowd full of pretty young dames
If you gonna do dirt, then you can't leave a stain, man!
Tiger Woods y'all
He like them white girls, I like them hoods y'all
She got her head straight, she got a good job
She give the best brain, she got them good jaw
I got that good game, that's cause I'm good, y'all
And J. Cole the lil' engine that could, y'all
And yeah I'm coming for the top, like I should, y'all
And bitch I never fall off, knock on wood, y'all
Yeah...
Take ya'll back... to them school days, yeah
Fayettenam, what up, man?
We came a long way from stick and move
Niggas skipping school, just to scrap over bullshit
Nigga if you lose, it's a wrap, them hoes clowning
It goes down in the lunch room
I'm tryna spit this game nigga, fuck food
Bust moves to the hallway
My niggas posted on the wall, always
Ain't thinking about class, dog, my ass tryna parle
If we had this shit our way
We be standing here all day
But look the principal's coming, give pounds then we all escape
All late to class with fake passes
Living life in the fast lane, but ain't passing
They dreaming, tryna be the next Jay-Z and Dame Dashes
I ain't even open my book and it's time to change classes
Walk straight past my ex and don't speak
It's all good, I'll probably have a new ex by next week
I just think, the shit we did was silly, yo, I know that
But what I wouldn't give to go back
Yeah, back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish I was a kid again
Yeah, I sit and wish
Yo, I walk another nigga girl to her class, with my hand on her ass
If he say 'what up' later, I just laugh
Real sneaky yo, gotta keep it low
Up in math, let my nigga read this real freaky note Kiki wrote, yea
Hooping up in P.E. you can't see me on this gym flo'
But damn Vanessa booty looking sick up in them gym shorts
Uh, we bag 'em up, ya'll niggas gonna have to wait
So they passing hate like, 'Damn I can't wait 'til they graduate.'
But some of my niggas will probably never make it
The S.A.T. shit man I doubt they ever take it, cause
Instead of tryna send a nigga to a tutor
Them guidance counselors tryna introduce us to recruiters, it's a set-up
Momma cut the light on, time to get up
Make sure the shirt matching the forces then I head out
At the time I thought this shit was so whack
I'm a little grown, but still reminisce
Close your eyes nigga, you remember this?
Friday night football game, something I'll forever miss
After parties in the gym, grinding underneath the rim
You forgot your school I.D? Fuck, nigga, you ain't gettin' in
In the hallways acting like some hoodlums
See that scrap? Naw, damn I always miss the good ones
Them rumors spreading fast with that he say she say
Twenty people on the phone cause everybody did three-way
Man we played them girls for the fools, but
Wasn't no ladies like them ladies from other schools
Cause seeing them same old chicks got tired quick
She was just fucking my boy, now she all on my dick, gossip, damn
Another chick pregnant, another nigga gone
I reminisce on all the chicks a nigga never bone
Pardon me ya'll I'm just flipping through some Kodaks
Sitting, wishing I could go back
Yeah, this shit is dedicated to all my niggas man
R.J., Mike Shaw, Jim Brown, yeah
B. Nasty, Big Joe, Smitty, what's good? Yeah
Terry Sanford High School, E. Smith
Class of 2003, that's me
I know y'all remember this
For all my ville niggas man
All my Carolina niggas man, (lights off and shit)
All my real niggas, no matter where you come from
A dolla and a dream, thats all a nigga got
So if its about that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I was raised in the F-A-Y (why), a nigga never gave me nothing?
Pops left me, I ain't never cry, baby, fuck him, that's life
And trust me I'm living, look what a nigga made out
The shit that I was given, look what a nigga came out
Momma sewing patches on my holes
Man, our hoes couldn't put this flame out
Straight up, I got my back against the brick wall
I'm from a world where niggas never pop no Cristal, it was pistols
You pass through, you better pray them bullets missed y'all
I thank the Lord, He let a nigga make it this far
A lot niggas don't, a lot of moms weep
I gotta carry on, all the weight is on me
You never know when a nigga might try to harm me
Rest In Peace that nigga John Lee, I pour liquor, homie
It's foul, but yo the world keeps spinning
Gotta keep winning, get up off this cheap linen
Nigga I'mma eat, even if it means sinning
Niggas want beef, I'mma sink my teeth in 'em
Pause, I go harder, I am all about a dollar
You niggas street smart? I'm a motherfucking scholar
So trust me, I ain't stopping 'til my money is long
So much dough, them hoes will think I'm rocking money cologne
Have a model at the crib waiting, "Honey, I'm home."
Cooking greens for a nigga, give 'em plenty, a dome
It's funny, we dream about money so much its like we almost got it
Until we reach up in our pockets, its time to face reality
The ville is a trap nigga now
And if you ain't focused you gonna be here for awhile, yeah
My nigga Mike rolling with me, riding shotgun
Type a nigga know about every car, but don't got one
That's hunger, no wonder niggas fucking with the evils
Posted on the corner, selling crack like its legal
But who am I to judge how a nigga get his paper?
This money coming soon, dog, I'm tryna get my cake up
I guess I gotta wake up these niggas myself
An E&J sipper, but my shit is top shelf
Young J, the rawest shit you niggas ever heard of
A journalist nigga, call me the Fayetteville Observer
You know the routine, man
Fayettnam
Real niggas can relate
And Ville niggas can relate, man
My niggas know about the struggle, man
What you know about your momma sewing patches on your holes, nigga?
I had the light blue jeans with the green patches, haha, oh shit
I was in like first grade man, I swear
It was like the Sixes came out, the Jordan Sixes
Them shit was so fly man, I wanted them so bad
Darryl what up man?
My nigga Darryl had them shits on in class yo
I wanted that shit so bad
I begged my mom for that shit, you know
But she couldn't afford it, yo, she gave me
Got me some Reeboks black tops, ahaha
But that was all good tho, cuz uh
The year after that I had, I had some, some no name shits
Some all black shits, haha
Them shits had metal, metal shoelace buckles and shit, you know?
But you know back then niggas didn't
Niggas ain't even know he was broke man, no worries and shit
But uh, times have changed man, I got bills
My mom is in debt, what you know about that?
College loans and shit, nigga
Gotta get this money, ma
Cole world, cold blooded
Trapping niggas at my shows and them hoes love it
Backpacking niggas with the afros love it
So don't holla at a nigga if you got no budget
Trying to get my braid up, nope not talking cornrows
Trying to get my grade up, oh, look how my score rose
Playing Jigga hits he say good, make more those
Cole got delivery bitch, you got digiornos
They fucking with me because I'm real as shit
Well if you feel this shit, here goes some realer shit
I signed a big deal and went to the dealership
Man they took one look at my credit and said forget it
Now I'm in this train with a mil to my name
Ain't shit changed because I still feel the pain
Like a gym or a rim dog, I'm built for the game
Something like a pimp because I'm still with the 'caine
Unh, a little drug dealer reference what, I can't try
These niggas out here lying, why can't I
Flashbacks where my teacher told me I can't fly
Then he looked at nigga crazy because I say why
Now look, no wings but I'm flier than the birds
Co-signer on a beamer, but it's whiter than the burbs
Something like a genius, but man I've done been a nerd
Just to tutor bad bitches while admiring the curves
That might have been a noun, that might have been a verb
But I'm just trying to find what you hiding in that skirt
Hey Cole got her coming now he might've been the first
So she only fuck with hymn/him like a choir in a church
Good God, momma told him get a good job
Be a doctor or a lawyer, if you're black they won't employ ya'
Well nigga I'mma show ya', this that Jesse Jackson
Af-firmative action so master I'm taxing uh
Don't let the cover fool ya', bitch I ain't no freshman
In my own class man, I write my own passes
I hear the shots fired, yeah I see the stones casted
My shit is already fire, don't gas it
Niggas hear my album say sound like a classic
Niggas say your album might not even see the plastic
Bastard, how you gonna match with a nigga
Who done mastered the shit you practice
Catch this, a Ville nigga 'til the day of my casket
Put on for my city like my favorite jacket
Man you gonna wear that every god damn night
Know what I paid for this shit? bitch, you got damn right!
Uh, yea
Let me warm up man, let me warm up man!
I got to warm up man!
Yea, Elite what up! Yea Warm Up
Look niggas wanna know the formula for success
Sheeitt, but I studied for this test
Ay nigga I'm better than the rest you just rest boy please
Me I'm trynna stretch my treasurer chest, like some double D breast
So a nigga on a quest- no question
So I tell em birds no nesting
Laying in my bed hope to lay a niggas egg, No- you'll never hatch mines
Baby, you don't match mines
I'm trynna shine like the bat sign, when it's crime
And the gats flyin up in Gotham, watch em
Far from a thug but I'll drop one
Far from a scrub but I'll mop em
Watch 'em better leave 'em alone (Malone) like Stockton, when he retired
Shit your shit is fire boy stop
I don't buy it, boycott, stop lying
Ya shit is not hot man if niggas not buying
It's not rocket science
But the way I rock it help me build up my alliance
These niggas ain't playing in New York like the Giants-ha!
A little line to show love to the city that got no love
Don't want to see a nigga grow rather see a nigga hold-up
That's cold blooded, well never to fail
If you can make it here you can make if from heaven to hell
I'm just a little nigga strait out the Ville
Always been sick probably never get well
And no time soon, step to a nigga get 4 times 2
Bet the way I spit it leave your mind blew, with more rhymes due
Nigga you tryning who?
Sheeit, nigga you tryning me, bitch I'm better than all them niggas you trynna be
Shit, nigga you trying me? Bitch I'm better than all them niggas you trynna be
Look, it's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's no time to chill I'm trynna build
Bitch there's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build
It's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
Bitch it's no time to chill nigga! Yep
My man, Shawn, from around the way, son, been down from day one
Never been known for mistakes but was bound to make one
Her name was Nina, see he was all about the cash flow
Til she came and had this man pussy whipped to the max yo
A true dime piece describin her, brown eyes
Caramel skin, thick thighs, goes beyond speech
But besides looks her mind's lost
Known for kickin cats to the curb, leaving their hearts on the sidewalk
Shawn was one of them, she said she was lovin him
But only fucked him because he had some funds comin in
He couldn't see it though
She was cheating and he didn't even know
He even bought a crib with this schemin ho
In the ride, mad jewels, mad clothes, mad shoes
And to show his commitment he got her name tattooed
I gotta hand it to her, she had the stuff planned out
But watch what happened when her luck ran out
What goes around comes around
What goes up must come down
You up now but you'll get yours
Some how
Some day
In some way, shape, or form
Revenge is coming
No way to escape the storm
Time passes, Shawn is thinking about wedding rings
But he knows the signs of cheating and doesn't wanna believe them
He disregards them, goes out for diamond ring shopping
Now the big question is when is he gonna pop it
Waiting for the right time
Meanwhile Nina's the same ho
Like a snare drum but bangs way more
For Shawn up to this point shit's going well
Til one day his homeboy hit him on his cell, like
"Yo son you won't believe this, I just seen your chick." ("Where?")
"In the mall with this cat, he was palming her ass
I swear to God son. Need me to run up on him and drop him?"
"Nah, chill I got this, I'll hit you back if it's poppin"
He hung up, I called Nina, "Where you at? What you doing?"
"At the mall with some friends buying new Timbs."
Somethin sounded funny
She was lying for sure
But Shawn had a little plot of his own
I missed you (Aw)
Missed you so bad I followed you (What, where?)
Followed you all the way to your boyfriend's rendevouz (What?)
Yeah bitch you caught now
So don't even try to give me that shit you thought how it wasn't you who I saw now (No it wasn't)
You trifling ho, I gave my whole life to you yo
And now you basically shove a knife in my throat (It's not like that)
But it's alright though, the same cat you was fucking with then
Is currently laying dead in the trunk of my Benz (Oh God)
Yeah get to crying, in a minute you'll be there beside him
And by the time the cops find you I'll be in the islands (No, I'm sorry)
Visualizin what could have been between me and you
It was just just a dream, you fucked up the thing between us two
So now it's speak your peace before you leave this earth bitch (We can work this out)
I hope that shit was worth it
And now I pray that God is merciless
With this said, goodbye to the reason I lived this life (Shawn)
Pointed the gat to her mouth, long kiss goodnight (No)
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?"
A crooked smile
This crooked smile
Listen
I got a story for ya, when I was seventeen
I had a name, was far from lame and that meant everything
I hit the club with my nigga Ced. ain't nuttin' new
But on this particular night that we was coming through
Niggas was on the stage, battlin' babblin'
Going nowhere, I figured, "Fuck it, there's a couple hoes here"
I might as well sign up and climbed up the stage
I went first, I kicked my verse, spit like a lion out the cage
The crowd feeling my rage, I aired the nigga
Tossed the mic right to 'em like I dared the nigga
Thought I scared the nigga, DJ started the beat
His heart started to beat fast, the part of defeat
The nigga verse was weak, that is until he said this
"You ain't So So Def, your teeth just got Jagged Edges"
Damn, that was the dagger that killed my swagger
I never hit that stage again, I begged my mom for braces, then I had a
Crooked smile
Growing up was just a young knucklehead running wild
Momma youngest, e'erybody knew I was the problem child
Front teeth missing in my smile, snaggletooth nigga for a while
Liftin' up my pillow, tooth fairy never came around
Damn, we was po', but I ain't know
Mouth open at the mirror daily, look and wonder how my teeth'll grow
They came slow and out of line, I couldn't comprehend
The significance at the time, this crooked smile
Was just another sign saying life ain't fair
Some niggas had the perfect smile with the nice wave hair
Oh yeah, remember Brandy? Loved her like candy
She went with my nigga, Sosa, I was scared to approach her
That nigga had the fresh new gear, J's drop
He got a fresh new pair, and there I was with hand-me-downs
Turn into the class clown, teachers couldn't stand me now
Defense mechanism, lookin' for attention
With this crooked smile
And the blood will dry, underneath my nails
And the wind will rise up, to fill my sails
See you can doubt, and you can hate
But I know, no matter what it takes
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
Tell the world I'm coming
Still far away, from where I belong
But it's always darkest before the dawn
Home
I'd rather be with you babe, yes I do
I'd rather beeeeee with youuuuuuuuuuuu
Rather be, rather
Rather beee with youuuuuu
Ay though I love you hate that bitch that's always with you
A Shame I gotta put up with her shit just to get you
She threw another fit you had to split because she was wit you
And now I'm at the crib all alone damn I miss you
Ay when we first met you was too tense for me to get through
And then I got you loose it's like a glove how I fit you
Your two lips they smell like tulips so official
My niggas'll probably clown me if I told 'em that I kissed you
But you clean as a whistle wet as a tissue in the toilet
Love to hit that spot get you hot like I boil it
Even let ol' girl watch she enjoy it
Even though she make it hard for me to see you
Knowing that I need you
Now look, don't make a grown nigga beg that ain't fair bitch
Just take them clothes off oh look you got your hair did
For me looks good she said oh you so sweet
Now get me while you can you bout to have to wait a whole week
Ah hell not the beast really I don't give a fuck
Well since you already bleedin' that mean I don't get to cut
Ay look I'm already fienin' so just let me slide thru
Tell your homegirl relax and let me get inside you
Because that booty mad thick behind your juicy ass lips
I'm trying to get you hot and wet you know Jacuzzi that shit
Then I'm bustin' like an uzi in this bougie ass chick
The only reason that I put up with this moody ass bitch
Is... you
Rather be, (Hey baby its... you) rather
Rather be, (Now baby its... you) rather
(And I... ) rather beee with youuuuuu
I x4
I told you, not to wear that dress to the club tryna dance up on me
I told you, not to push that thing on me
If you know I want it
It’s gon’ get you in trouble
(oooh, oooh)
Baby I told you, not to wear them heels that make your legs look so sexy
I I I I
I told youNot to wear them heels that say I’m ready come get me
Ay Ay
They gon get you in trouble
Go up to my room, you’ve been such a, such a bad girl
Such a sexy naughty girl
You know what you doing baby
Go up to my room girl
You’ve been such a, such a bad girl
Yeah, invitations in the whirlwind
We both bad at it
Told myself no more hittin’ niggas girlfriends
Thats my old bad habit
Here you go, wearin' that
Already know, what I’m staring at
I mean from top to bottom your body is problem so
Somebody better take care of that
And who
Better than, the nigga in the Letterman
When your man ain't home, you can let him in
Late night Letterman
I ain't gon' tat-a-tale
Damn your ass bad as hell
I told you not to stare at me like that when I’m performing
I-I-I-I told you
Thats thats gon’ make us til the early morning
That's warning
Memphis connect
Temperature check, sick as a bitch
If niggas want smoke
Me and that nigga named Moneybagg Yo is a lit cigarette
Pick up a check
So many digits, this shit just be lookin' like cell phone numbers
What the hell wrong with us?
Well known hustlers
Climbed up from the tailbone
Where the world don't want us
Plus your niggas be dumpin'
They shootin' from close like some elbow jumpers
Put myself on
Niggas look real, but they silicone
Tucked titty, got a redbone
And the head strong
Like Biggie said, boy, you're dead wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Huh, can we vibe just a little?
That would be a dream come true
Ain't gon' lie, just like a fiend, I've been feelin' you
Just a little, just a little
Um, uh
Had to let it ride just a little
Let me bring it back so it's clear
I've been wantin' you since we were little
Now we're full grown and you here
Do you have time? Just a little
I can make it worth your while
Ain't you diggin' me a little?
Damn, it look good when you smile
Just a little
Don't let mine ever change
Don't ever change, don't ever change
I'm still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Two steps back just to get it right
Still slummin' while I'm chasing life
Took two steps back just to get it right
Took off my work badge, realize I'm back in the hood
Like what's good, my cousin called, told me he coming through
Like "Yo what up, why you back bruh?
See you should be laying tracks with J. Cole and who knows
Maybe he sign yo ass
See I don't know just how this rap thing go
From the looks of it you closer than most niggas that I know
Please explain, way I see it bruh, you paving lanes
What you don't believe cause boy your songs did some things for me
Had me thinking we was trapped, but Lute you set us free
Niggas stay focused, when it's right for you, it's meant to be
Every time I play a song you gain a fan
Nigga you the man, drop a song, what you waiting on?
You in high demand and that's life
Only one time to get it right
Take a flight, view this world from a different height
See this hood still the same, no matter how you view it
You got dreams, I just rather you pursue it
Just promise you never change, I don't care just how you do it
Fuck them niggas you ain't gotta prove shit
And see this hood still the same, no matter what you doing
So for you I empty out a whole clip"
As I let the Chevy skate, like Tradewinds back in the day
Wish upon these stars like "God, show me that way"
Cause ain't no looking back
Been in the trap so long, I'm tired of shooting back
Keep your eyes peeled, don't let the steel hit you
Envy be that bitch that fuck the niggas that chill with you
That's why I can never trust these niggas
Trigger finger itchin', contemplating should I pull it
Lost more friends to bullshit than a bullet
Brother Pooh called me up, he told me stay consistent
"The fact that you yourself what make you different
Like fuck the gold chains, diamond rings
Keep your eyes on the prize, that don't make a difference
Cause you're still a young king without the bling
Keep your eyes on the prize, shine on these niggas"
I'm hollering hey, good God what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay
Ay tell me whats work without play
All my niggas hollering hey, good God what a day
Hey baby girl tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollering bout the problems of the world
Its just me and my favourite girl, now all around they holler
He gonna have the nerve to fucking tell me niggas from the south can’t spit?
Bitch I’ll smack your dumb ass
(Fayettenam what up? Carolina what up?)
Stupid ass mother fuckers (New York, what up? Queens)
I'ma quit talking shit and about show y’all
I told y’all niggas that I’m getting my bread and going home
I'ma show you all stupid ass motherfuckers (Coming soon, nigga)
Dumb ass niggas
The heir to the throne
South nigga bred to the bone
But haters say he fled from his home (Please)
Now picture that, I was 18 with million dollar dreams (Yeah)
Moved to Jamaica Queens, like Prince Akeem
But ain’t looking for no queen, (nah)
Came to get my c.r.e.a.m. (yup)
City on my back, I just lift my wings, I’m fly
You niggas on my dick, why lie?
Thought them niggas from the south couldn’t spit, voilà
I’m here. humble out of respect, not fear
So please be clear, nigga please beware
I’m a motherfucking monster, B.S. me? (Nah)
No, my hand game like fucking PSP
Now pop the champagne, money is coming soon
My dick do the damn thing, honey it’s cumming soon
She jerking, bend her over, now she hurting
Living reckless got me thinking of death, look how she flirting
Well, fuck that bitch, man a nigga tryna breathe (Yeah)
Some of these niggas be tryna dick her down and leave
Rest in peace, y'all boys living too fast
Caught up in the cash, and got shot up in a flash
Ville niggas don’t play
When it comes to that money, think real niggas won’t spray?
Mid-day when it’s sunny, they kill niggas broad day
On some old new jack shit
This rap shit is like tag nigga you not it, so run
Ha ha ah
I’m the man, ha ha ha, yeah, hey
I’m the man
I’m the man, (I told y'all niggas)
They say I act like I’m the man, 'cause motherfucker I am
Niggas study my style, I should be giving exams
Damn boy I'm so flamboyant with the ensemble
Polo jacket, polo tee, what a fine combo
And I’m the man, now understand a nigga bossin’ (Yeah)
Scheming on that drop top CL but it’s costing (Yeah)
Long term plans for the fam, we’ll be golfing
Never catch a nigga double-crossing, unless i’m flossing (Woo)
In the streets niggas peaceful until you force em'
To quarter back them bullet passes, you could Randy Moss ‘em
Goddamn you niggas got handled
Niggas only publishing, my style got sampled
So I switched like a thick bitch with some heels on
I seen a nigga get popped, I feel for ‘em
I know who did it, but you think I’m finna squeal on him?
Shout out to R.J. Hill I would kill for him
That’s word, nigga observe my genius
E&J sipping got a nigga straight leaning
My DNA dripping while your girl stay drinking (Haha)
I told y’all I’m the man, what the fuck y'all niggas thinking?
First and foremost, Fayettenam what’s good?
Carolina, what up? Bull city, Raleigh, Charlotte, Salem
Greensboro, Wilmington, nigga
Everywhere dog, I’m reppin' from long distance, man
I told y’all boy, I’m bout to get this money and come home right quick
Y’all niggas still see me tho, you think I’m still there; you ain’t even know I’m gone
Back so much, nigga
I hear you all little niggas talking, nigga
Prince of the city, nigga
Prince of the south, nigga, holla at me
Ya know? Heir to the throne, bitch
I wadn't lookin' for ya, I wadn't searchin'
I wadn't creepin' around, I wadn't lurkin'
I wadn't sleepin' around, I wadn't thirstin'
But I got a thang for ya, I got a thang for ya
You on ya job and it's damn sure workin'
Say she ain't a ho, but she far from a virgin
When it's time to cut, I'm somethin' like a surgeon
I do my thang for you
Hey, baby girl you gotta trunk, I might put you in valet
Way you stretching make a man think I put you in ballet
If I'm sliding through your city, I need you to dial me
And how much my niggas smoke reminding you of Friday
I can take you to DC, introduce you to Wale
You can look all through my phone as long as you don't call Jay
Is it cool to parle, we can do this all day
Just me and you off in my room, we call this do the hard way, hard way
I put it down, any spot, any city that I'm in (Hey)
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and tell a friend
To tell a friend, I put it down
Any spot, any city that I'm in (Hey)
And my niggas blow trees like the wind, so tell a friend
To bring a friend and bring 'em in
Bring 'em in, bring 'em in
And if they all bad you can bring 'em in
We take it to the grr, it's just you, me, and them
Now bring ya ass over here
A nigga tryna take you home like a souvenir
One in a million, girl, you lookin' like you knew Aaliyah
And ah, I got a thang for ya, I got a thang for ya
A stewardess and yet you flew the leer
'Cause you're fly as hell, shawty walking through the air
Game cold like the toes on a polar bear
And ah, I do my thang for ya
Now baby girl if looks can kill then you catchin' bodies
How I'm stretching you, guess no need to go get pilates
When I'm sliding through ya city, meet me in the lobby
And you put that thang up on me like you tryna rob me
Can I hit it in the mornin' while you moanin'? Prob'ly
Got you sweatin', now you gettin' wet as a tsunami
We can do this all day, treat it like a hobby
But if I tell you get to stepping like you Pam and Tommy, don't mind me
Did I meet you for a reason or for a season
Or either the night of ya life at the Four Seasons?
Whisper to ya home girl you love Cole World
'Cause his flow thorough, I give you a few more reasons
Not because his verse or 'cause I can buy purse
You know, the type of shit your man could only purchase on the first
And not because he faker than turf, softer than Nerf footballs
I got his girl's lip gloss all on my girth
Because I'm so clever better than ho-eva
The coldest nigga even when wearin' like four sweaters
Well versed, well rehearsed, the go getter
These broke niggas got good dressing and no lettuce (Argh)
You would think niggas would know better
It's oh-11, you would think niggas would flow better
I know you're so fed up
And so I had to blow and I ain't talking coke header, I won't let up
Yeah, what's good baby?
Shit, I ain't seen you in a minute
Now you wanna' hit me
Shawty I'mma tell you something you don't wanna' hear(yeah), hear(yeah), hear(yeah)
You threw a nigga to the curb
I fronted like I didn't even care(yeah), care(yeah), care(yeah)
But deep down
I needed your umbrella couldn't make it through the rain(yep), rain(yep), rain(Yep)
So I been fuckin' everthing in this town trying to run from the pain, pain, pain
And now suddenly you say you wanna chat, but what is that?
You feel like Kobe, like I'm Shaq
Look how you need a nigga back
Ironic
You burned my heart up like some chronic
Now you say you want it once mo' but what fo'
You did me dirty like some must
So shit why would I?
Plus my niggas know you played me so how could I?
Nah fuck trynna look cool I ain't nobody's fool
I sang the blues for like four months
Now you wanna show up?
You saying that you feenin' for me screaming to me
Boy I need you bad
Oh, you want me bad how the cops want black folks
Bad like Dirty Diana
Bad like black toast
Bad like sour lactose like that crack smoke
You feenin'
Left a nigga out to dry like some semen
Baby deaded me
Was far from a dog I had no pedigree, Unh
No leash needed
You ripped up your lease speeded out the crib
Now I'm supposed to just forget and forgive
Pardon, you say I'm your heart
But baby how bad do you want it, want it?
One thing you should know about me is I never play to lose, huh
Always aim high and rarely obey the rules
Never tell my business, if I did, it make the news
They say, "Time is like money," you should come and pay your dues
And come kick it, can I get a minute? Maybe an hour, huh
Would you let me peak my head in for a second while you shower? Huh
I bet you got some real good power, if you feel me
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, you know just what's gon' heal me, baby
Uh, yeah
I said it won’t be long (no)
‘fore we out here baby
Gotta get you up out here baby
Said it won’t be long
We up out here baby
I say a prayer and look up in the sky
Thank God even though a nigga headed to this tired day job
Will my eyes stay wide still I know I’m gonna blow
This is music for my niggas cause I know you want more
Cause that old shit fake but this new shit real
J. Cole not Jay but this that Blueprint feel
Hey Cole is you crazy that's some big boots to fill
Yeah straight out the Ville and the shoes fit well
Seen heaven, seen hell, seen niggas get killed
Knew every detail still never would tell
Scared of the repercussion, scared of them people bussin'
Bullets be hittin’ nigga’s you swear they could be percussion
Niggas be holding triggers before they could read instructions
Oh God, never did our fathers teach us nothing
No law, but became a man on my own
Showed my momma I could stand on my own
Dear mama, your son hurting
Living in this cold World where niggas shun virgins
And praise hoes
As days go by shawty 19 years old
No clothes for her baby yet she stay so fly
Tell me why mamma do you cry
Is it cause you know my teacher be feeding me lies
Is it cause you know that Preacher is greedy inside
Cause racism is alive I see the disguise
Mamma I know it hurts
It hurts me to watch you go to work barely hanging on
Some rich man getting richer while you slaving for him
So whats the options for him
A young nigga from the hood without a pops at home
Surrounded by no good
And soon no good becomes so good quick
A little drug money got him feeling so hood rich
Killing your hood with the same shit Ronald Reagon filled up your hood with
And it’s still in your hood shit
I’m feeling no good mamma
I’m sick of my soul
Is there a better life for us I just sit and I hope
I just hope and I pray
It’ll change one day I’ll make a change one way
And mamma I can fly you out this cold world
This cold life, it’s all wrong
There’s no right
Its hard to see the good when there’s no light
Just grab onto me, trust me hold tight!
This is pain, this is love, this is sent from above
This a gift from the Gods, this was meant to be
You can run, you can hide, you can front, you can lie
But in time you gon' find you was meant for me
You a part of me and I'm a part of you
I'm addicted, one hit won't do I need a lot of you
Overdosing, your potion has got me floating on cloud nine
Tell me what I'm supposed to do when I run out of you, I'm through
I need a fix like d-boys need bricks
And plus whips to transport 'em
J. Cole, I seen it tall, you can't short 'em
One more time together
I hope your new man don't mind, girl you're mine forever
Is it on me?
Hmmmmm, hmmmmmm
Hmmmm, hmmmm
NYC, Cole World
Look, they say I'm something like a teacher
I guess they right, I'm with your bitch on her
How to play FIFA, kick game Messi
Switch lanes while I get brains, bet me
I don't whiff stain anything these pricks aim at me
I am hater proof, the straight up truth
Went and got my weight up God
Now I'm straight-up Zeus
Silly little rappers rhyming 'bout their made-up coupes
That you ain't ever gonna drive, jets you will never step inside
So just step aside, rather look up at the sky
Don't you see this middle finger from my big ol' G5, I
Chartered planes, ballin' blowin' money fast though it's all in vain
You only live once, so fuck the cops
Who'd rather see us all in ball-and-chains
My aim is to stretch my name in your Hall of Fame
Next to Elvis, paint a vivid picture of where hell is
And crawled out, heart froze and it never thawed out
So I balled out, with my balls out
Screamin' live for the moment, make sense don't it
My mama need a crib I'm gon' cop it and she'll own it
We gon' toast to the days when they foreclose our shit
Now we livin' better thanks to the flows I spit
And I'll make sure she paid like she wrote my shit
That's a Wayne line, no time to count this dough I get
All this gear I don't wear, I need four closets (damn)
Go figure, my pockets got bigger
Now all those I don't fuck with say "That's my nigga"
"That's my nigga"
Look
They give props to the others but them niggas ain't help
Take a look around, girl I built this shit up myself
At a time when niggas cry 'bout how they sit on the shelf
I gave the world 2 classics to put on my belt
Way before "Work Out" I did them sit-ups myself
Too many hands in my pockets, niggas hit at my wealth
I gotta, re-maneuver these deals, they need improving drastically
Cause homie if you asking me
I'm supposed to be the richest nigga since Master P
If not, at least half, my nigga at least half
Afraid of 30, still looking twenty, like he's Fab
Subtle shit, throwing these jabs like he's Zab
I seen, Mac Miller, that nigga got mad millers
The rap Brad Miller and even a tad iller
You see me, salute me, it's crazy the way they do me
You would feel me if you niggas knew me, let's make a movie
Out this shit, cause these hoes getting choosy out this bitch
Playing "Juicy" in jacuzzis, getting woozy I could sip
Champagne and hopefully forget the whole damn thing
We pullin' hoes like a ol' hamstring
Cole so damn mean, and high as fuck nigga no landing
Long as I'm alive, no man king
And nigga that was the hook
This music's my weapon so anyone that's interrupting
Get a Colin Kaepernick bullet straight to the chest
Tryna make an impression, so if I aim to the left
And you can't make the reception, ya man'll catch a great interception
I'm nice nigga, could've dropped the album like twice nigga
So nigga fuck your advice nigga
Started off friendly, now all these niggas my enemies
What could you say to offend me?
I could go forever, Flex, I could go forever
Born Sinner, TOMORROW, June 18th
I could go on forever
2-6, Fayettenam
Carolina, Southeast shit
It's a Carolina thing, from the 'Ville to the QC
All my niggas on Bragg, Bunce Road, to The Murk, Greensboro, Bonnie Doone
Eutaw, Winston, Cliffdale, Durham
Visions of home, the streets that I roam, it’s been awhile
Raise me like the father I never had, I’m still your child
And though I’ve grown in ways that you’ve never known
I’ve ventured into the world, I’ve moved out all on my own
I’m doing this all for you, I hate to leave you alone
Seen shit you wouldn’t believe, I write em down in these poems
And put them out for the world, I know you listening too
Heard you saying shit about me I hope the shit isn’t true
Man look at the shit I came from, this narrow point of view
How you hatin’ on a nigga that wanted it more than you?
I ran through them spots with you and fucked the same bitches too
And just because I ride with you, I scrap with them niggas too
Came back for them niggas too, ain’t no trappin nigga, it’s true
Yet they play me on repeat because I rap for them niggas too
See I started with nothing but passion and then I blew
To the Roc, damn the tops a spectacular fucking view
Visions of home, visions of home
Yeah, visions of home, this is my zone
This is my joy, this is my pain, this is my song
This for my cousin Ricky damn nigga it’s been too long
Hate that my nigga Smitty slangin’ but to each his own
Gotta feed yo’ self, smoke a little weed just to ease yourself
Fuck the whole world, I don’t need your help
You’re the reason why momma had those rocks
All my niggas never even had no pops
Remember that? Ya remember that?
If ya don’t, double back
Momma found a much better crib on a safe street
But I’m still where the trouble at, where the trouble at?
That’s ‘cause my folks there, what it look like if I don’t go there?
I’m dead wrong, it’s been way too long, long
My folks there, what it look like if I don’t go there?
I’m dead wrong, it’s been way too long
Visions of home
Just got off the phone with my nigga Smitty
Shit too real back home boi, for real
This for my nigga, Ced, hold ya head
I know shit rough, but nigga we don't give up
We don't get mad, nigga, we just get tough
We just get right, nigga, we don't get left
Fuck what they said
'Cause what we learned coming up, you can't teach that shit
Life deal a nigga blows, but we eat that shit
This one here's for my brother, we gon' beat that shit, now
I say my prayers
I got too many people in my head right now
So many that's in jail or they dead right now
One time for my nigga Craig right now
He in the feds - damn, the times change
And these stupid niggas talking 'bout crime pay
You can keep that shit
I just made a million, call me when you reach that shit
Ain't bragging, I'm just shedding some light
One time for my granny up in heaven tonight
And the young boy from a show down in Hampton
Told me that my song was the reason he beat cancer
Ain't know what to say, I just froze
Little too deep, I suppose
But after a year of review
I figured out it wasn't me, it was you, nigga
Congratulations
Yeah, look how I came up
Yeah, ayy, look how I came up, nigga
Ayy, look
Momma I came up
Cold as hell in New York but I flame up
Straight up out that dirty type of shit you cannot clean up
A dollar and a dream the only things I had to bring up
Now any nigga out there gunning for me gotta aim up
Say what, niggas ask me what the Ville be like
Just tell em that it's real, hoping that they me feel me, right
I'm so bright I close my eyes and I can still see light
I'm so live you motherfuckers gotta kill me twice
Man, I promise I'm murdering classics, paying my homage
The fifteenth of the month and I'm just now paying Mohammed
Said the rent's due on the first, but he don't know the shit
I been through and it hurts, can't wait to blow
Yeah, I think about heaven sometimes, can't wait to go
If it's real will I even get in, I ain't fo' sure
'Cause I've been sinning
Getting bent it's been a minute since I been
Up in a church
Only time is when my friend up in a hearse
Lord, I'm praying for me my Momma
I just went up in her purse
Not to steal
All I saw was some bills and not a dollar
In sight
It’s time she lived a more desirable life
I'm chasing money
And dreams only God got the means to take em from me
I scheme while I'm riding through Queens
I ain't no dummy
A Fayettenam repper 'til the day that I'm gone
Nigga get your weight up all the way up if you hating on me
Cause boy I might pray but ain't no preying on me
I'm hot like Satan just laying on me
So when you get to hell you can say you know me
I said I might pray but ain't no preying on me
So when you get to hell, you can say you know me
Put my forearm in a sling, pen game Dr. Seuss
This that buy and buy, how'd you get so fucking cool?
Had to heel-toe out my body, girl, to tell the truth
Nigga feeling like I never catch up, that's the fuel
I've been here since the beginning like I promised you
Blowing smoke, showing growth, no one's close
Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever
Never, Rozay rich forever
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked
And just from life, knocking you on your ass
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys
Back in the days, I would've hated on the New Boyz
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went
A couple singles but could never be the main event
Without substance, something for them to grab on
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long
I ain't even certain, one day they love you
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane
I pray to god end they reign
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about
And could've died when I came from disbelief
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak
We the new lost boys, shouts to Mr. Cheeks
Shouts to Queens, getting money regiment with my getting money regime
I'm a money machine, developing the routine, nah mean?
Nah mean, nah mean?
That was like a Jay Z joint
Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?
You know how he used to say it
Nah mean?
B-r-r-ing, warm up
Face like 10. Shape like 8. And I gotta blow you out
She taste like cake. Wait... Look... Its your birthday..
Well then you shouldn't of left home in the first place..
Came with her friends the designate driver...
And I never met a woman thats so innocent to lie...
Don't know if you believe but you the illest chick alive
Ya brain tell em sick of it I call it ill advised
And I love you for your mind..
But I'm after something different..
For I take you any deeper..
Put a mattress on your feelings..
While I'm back here
Just twisten shes fellin she tease she ain't ready to fuck she loves fuckin with me..
I told you...
Not to wear them pants
That make your ass poke like that
Real nigga fuck around and stroke like that
I told youuu
Not to touch right there when I'm driving this car like that
You gon’ make a real nigga have a heart attack-
Don't do it no
Got my eyes on your legs
And my mind on your head
Know what you said-
But girl you gon' do it though
Gon’ do it slow
Gon' do it fast
Either way, you know, your ass in trouble
But she likes the attention
Hang around a nigga cause the pussy on lunch-in
She know what I'm about
She know I love her mouth
Cause she don't run her mouth
Dat’s
Oooh ohh look like somebody need a time out
But just in time cause I need something to rhyme bout
Sit in the corner but keep poking that behind out
I put a belt on that ass you'll never get them lines out
I'm too real you can forget what they lying bout
I drop my pants you gon' think they let the lions out rawrr
Somebody cool as bedonkadoodle, blow out suck in
Sound like I'm eating ramen noodles
Hot and heavy I'm sweating profusely
Keep my shades on medusa couldn't seduce me
Hold up and let me turn the camera on
And I'mma put a twist on it like it's M. Night Shamalyan
Here you go, wearing that
I mean from top to bottom your body is a problem so
Better than, the nigga in Letterman
I ain't gon tat-a-tale
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing a bet from a lack of promotions
Okay, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Let me try this
Uh, Yeah
Money coming soon
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
Omen what up nigga?
Yea niggaaaa, yea, uh
Gimmie my money, man, why else would a nigga be grinding? (right)
Out for them diamonds, dog, how else could a nigga be shining?(true)
I'm glowing, knowing that the flow intact
Get this record deal, I swear to God, my first 'mil I'm blowing that! (haha)
Like fuck it I know I'll grow it back, shit, it's nothing
Funny how blacks spend dough on mad shit for stuntin,'(yea)
But shit, that's all we know man, thats how a niggas raised (true)
You learn bout two things: getting pussy, getting paid. (uh)
And you should be gettin' laid by the time you in ninth grade
So niggas lying on they dick and hoes giving nice brain, yea
In class dreamin' bout having these nice things, (uh)
And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin'
But them whites ain't. (hmmm)
I brush it off like, "fuck it, it's motivation,"(yea)
Some niggas gotta walk through life, some niggas roller skating,)
Some niggas bypassing steps, some niggas chose to take 'em. (yea)
And for that fortune, man, some niggas sold their soul to Satan
But fuck it man, I ain't hatin,' I gotta go for mines
My little God-sister pregnant now, I put in overtime
On my grind, yea, just like the nigga making Folgers
I'm focused, on my bite, like a cobra, I'm tryna get my Oprah on
These hoes is crying cuz I won't pay 'em attention, (nah)
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin tuition, (ahaha)
Real niggas hustle by using their intuition, (yup)
While these fake niggas ain't into doing, they into wishin,'
I'm talking Benjamins, nigga
Grants nigga
From Washingtons, man
Tired of those
Yeah!
Till I'm rich, ain't no reason to settle nigga
Its greed that make a nigga wink at the devil to get that cheese
You niggas couldn't think at my level, even with trees
You couldn't get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please
I'm chasing G's tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves
Ease to the top and I'm not finna leave till I'm hot
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga
Boy, I'm shining without the diamonds in my mouth
Out grindin' while you reclining on your couch
I'm climbing, you haters blinded by the doubt
My niggas riding is devout, so talking violence out yo' mouth
And you gonna find what I'm about, nigga!
Far from a slouch, nigga, I ain't gonna parlé with y’all
I’ll probably hit ya, my hand game like Bobby Fisher
But check, them checks is all a nigga thinking
For them Presidents, I’ll treat a nigga like Lincoln
(Cole World)
Now you can choose the easy or hard way
Cole took the long way
A loser car-ley I moved up to Broadway
With night time to broad day
Pregame to foreplay
Used to cruise up to Bojangles
In R Jay’s lil Hyundai
Little bottle of that E&J
Liquor all in my DNA
Shout out NC A 'n' T, where I found that TNA
Ain’t seen me at the VMA
Nigga like me wasn’t nominated
One month later fuck a hater
Nigga like me done dominated
Wanna ride to the top
Then roll with me baby
They waitin' on me to drop
Like hov and B baby
Went from crappin' in diapers
To rappin' in cyphers
Ta doing more numbers
Then all them fuckin' lifers in Rikers
You see life is just like a box of chocolates
Never know what you 'bout to get
Take a bite rock wit it
And I love a bad bitch with confidence
Yo smile nice yo style right
And girl you got some mean thighs
So this right he is mean time
In between time
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup
I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mine bomb
Eat that shit like wonton
Jokin' baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein' that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right
H-town, oh yeah, I got this drink in my cup
I got this drink in my cup
I came down, hold up, hold up, I said hold up
Hold up, I done came down like hold up
Hold up, hold up, fuck, 'chea
Yeah, ain’t nuttin' to it but to do it, nigga that's true
A quarter milli and a Buick, nigga guess who?
It came to me like the dream that I once had
Them niggas said I couldn't do it, then I busted through
And now I'm flying worldwide, singing rap songs
Fucking all the bad hoes that I once knew
And busted nuts for all the times I was shitted on
See it was once fuck me, now it's fuck you
Clearly, now hear me
Back with a vengeance, hope you niggas feel me
You cut me deep and know it hurts severely
I'm a forgiver, I still love you dearly, sincerely
It's Truly Yours, bout to stack another quarter milli
Nigga got a quarter milli, don't be silly
Life make a nigga wanna yell out
Change for that fame, how some niggas turn sell out
Too old for my mama crib, I'm tryin to get the hell out
Stayin' out these cells but we working on that bailout
Help out, please. Sure is hard livin without cheese
Ain't shit in my pocket only these house keys
They pray for a nigga but yet they doubt me
That's why I'm out getting higher than balconies
But no I won't jump, being broke is childish and boy I'm grown up
My money runnin' late tho so boy I won't front
When my paper finally make you should know I'm gonna stunt
So, hard
Yeah, this is the... warm up
Okay, I roll up, hold up, look at how I showed up
I blowed up, had a hole up in my pocket, now it's sewed up
They feinin' for that crack, you know that rock, I got that product
You niggas tryna stop it, better load up, I hang my coat up
Aye, I'm gon' be here for a while so I smile, haters
I'm on that green like a flower, like an alligator
Now or later, I'm serving niggas; I'm a sound waiter
Just tell me what you want, I bring that back an hour later
Look how I cater, dog what you afraid of? Nothing
They talking gangsta without no data, they fronting
Jackie-Chan, Jean-Claude-Van-Dam, straight stunting
I wish a nigga would say something
I'm a Carolina nigga, boy I got it on my back
Piggy back style I ain't talking 'bout no tat
And I'mma rep the Ville in every city that I'm at
And I guarantee I'm bringing home plaques
Shoutout to my brother Zach, and my mother, I love ya
Yea look ain't that about a bitch? This nigga on his own dick
They say I'm like the human body, I produce my own shit
And I tote my horns. A star when I was born
My name ain't James, my word is bond
Yea shoutout to Canibus, had a similar line 98-99
Damn, that was the times never mind dwelling in the past
You're listening to the future
The flows gets tighter, them hoes get looser
Then they wanna seduce ya like Medusa, be cool
I said I got a girl, she told me, "Me too! "
So that must mean you want a nigga to eat that seafood
Baby don't be foolish but call her I'll watch her do it
Yea and this is only "The Warm Up" yea
Sometimes you rip straight through
(I told you how we was gon’ do it)
And sometimes you just love rappin’ this shit so much you just
(Drama I told you how we was gon’ do it)
You just like “fuck it” let me get that shit again
God, please forgive us
Yeah, blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers
He played the corner like Revis, he should've had better defense
I was a wilder nigga, back on my therapist shit
Moving careless as shit
Of the railroad tracks, where the scarecrows at
No brains on them niggas but they'll air your back
Fuck the man, Uncle Sam, I won't sell your crack
I'mma pass your classes, I'mma learn your craft
I'mma fuck your daughters, I'mma burn your flag
Beware of the days when the first go last
And the last go first, damn the past sure hurt
That’s why I hit the Henny in this flask
With my foot pressed heavy on this gas
Life is like a Brillo pad
Sometimes I sit and wish I had the life that Willow had
Said I walk around mad ‘cause I never see my dad
And you wonder why my motherfuckin’ brother’s so bad
And I was in the third grade first time I skipped class
Whoa!
Switch topics, look, my bitch tropic
Stack so thick to fit need six pockets
Smash whole cliques, so sick I get nauseous
Quick as pickpockets, slick like Rick Fox’s hair
Diamond chain, yeah the Roc is here
You lean back like a rocking chair
You niggas not prepared, no preparation
This is dedication
Slit your fuckin’ throat and blame it on my medication
Illuminati meeting, showed up late and met a Mason
Who saw me and assured me that there was no better nation
For, crooks and thieves, looks deceive
They throw The Book at niggas with no books to read
See, there I go, every time I try to stunt
Can’t help but kick the real shit
Man, why I even front?
Maybe ‘cause that’s all you little niggas ever want
But I’mma change the game
See you in a couple months, boy
The songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Finally give a nigga leg room and a whip
Yeah Cole World, make way for the chosen one
Ain't nobody else I’d rather be, not even Oprah’s son
Momma’s youngest gettin' paper like the oldest one
We livin' better, guess God felt he owed us one
Closets barely had no clothes in them
So you throw my niggas in hoopty
But we still bag hoes and them
These niggas give they heart and soul to them
I wonder if they know we dovin' them
Ass fat so when pinch ‘em like a Doberman
Run up on em politicing like Keith Olbermann
What’s your name
Where ya from
Ya got a dream
I’ll sell ya one
Come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Won’t stop, won’t stop
Hey and don’t stop
Now if it don’t jam the hoes won't rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends won't cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don’t got
Gotta see it to believe it
And don’t stop
There’s so much pain on my brain I gotta jot it out
But as of late nigga, it ain't been shit to pout about
I turn up the news, my blues seem petty
Cause my view of the city is incredible with no album out
I’m blessed nigga, I’m blessed
When I’m all alone these words just flow out of my chest
Turn ‘em into poems, they worship, I’m the best
And though I’m takin' long
They fuck with me none the less
Yeah, enough sleepin'
I put you niggas to rest
The only one sayin' shit is like a nigga got tourettes
Unimpressed with you niggas
You the shit only cause I digested you niggas
But I digress, boy you bout as G as a fucking tie dye vest
And your wifey is a bird even in her Prada dress
Want a nigga like me to come and get her out her nest
Like come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Hey, dont stop
On that Henny
My tour bus got plenty
I surplus so many
Wanna' serve us so many, Cole
Wanna' serve us so many, go
Babe, now I do some things I ain't so proud of, wait
Need to get this off my chest so can you stay
But you want me to beg
That ain't playing fair
I won't, won't do that
Shall we say, I'm still young but grown enough to make mistakes
You're the only one I left in me and my place
If you want an excuse, that's one thing I don't do, no babe
Love you baby, more than my own life
What else can I say if you're not satisfied
You be asking me about where I be
Wondering who I see, ain't you here with me
Baby, don't you trip, cause I lost that shit
Fuck them other chicks, but I know you ain't convinced
I tell ya'
Hey, I'm still young but grown enough to make mistakes
If you want me excused, that's one thing I don't do, now baby
Yeah, got a vendetta even though I been better
She be out of pocket when her friends wit' her
Disturbing the peace, curse words in the street
Man, shoulda' let the muhfucking Benz hit her
But I chilled though
And peeled off, real slow
Straight face, so she'll know
But damn that thing feels so good, make a nigga do the heel-toe
That's high school shit, baby this a different world
A world where women don't last long
Got so many hoes that I passed on
Leave her heartbroken with a cast on
Learning all the words to the sad songs
I know it seems that my past wrong
And so it seems that I'm past gone
Like one false move and yo ass gone
But you a lil' mo' purty, lil' mo' thick
Lil' mo' smarter, lil' mo' quick
Lil' mo sweeter, lil' mo' slick
Superwoman like Lil' Mo hit
So stop thinking that I'm still gon' dip
I know it might seem weird to you
That sometimes our dreams come true
But sometimes our fears do too
I bet they never seen him comin'
Like a blind bitch you fuckin' from behind
It's the motherfuckin' dime, bitch I'm fucking up rewind buttons
My shit is jumping like Lebron
Fayettenam on my back like some scratches from your lady
On your mattress where they gave me that
I bet niggas can't wait to pay me back
While they relax, I stay in tip-top shape
And I stay up on my toes like some gym socks, flip-flops
Tell them hater to rehab, kick rocks
Game tight like Ziploc
Half-Black, other half white like Kid Rock
Try to tell it to a cizz-op
Thought it would work, it did not
He told me "Nigga stizz-op, you know you is not"
Wrote the ticket and rizz-ocked
Fuck, this is for hip-hop, gassed up like a quick stop
They light a fire under my ass nigga my shit hot
Even if you squatted over volcanoes, niggas your shit not
I'm raw, but I kid not
Your shit flop, I give props to the legend
Praise God but I give not to the reverends
Lookin' up to the heavens like
"Where did all my blessings go?" You chase a dream
But then you stop, guess you'll never know
I got a show for you to watch, here's an episode, professional
Set to blow any minute now, many women smile
Look the lights and the action, and the cameras be callin'
You niggas got to log in, bitch, you fantasy ballin'
I snuck up like I planned to be, this ain’t random, we called it
Like once they get a hit of this, they hooked like that Twitter shit
Thought I get a deal and head straight to the dealership
But looking at my deal I probably can't afford benefits
Medical, dental shit, left but I always came
Back like a rent-a-whip, dirty ass game
Dog, I could run a kennel with all these bitch niggas
Who don't lift a finger yet they wanna ride in the limo with
Me, I switch the tempo on them sort of like Timbo on em'
Start talking that "we" shit, I pause Nintendo on 'em (hahaha!)
Start talking that beef shit, I turn to kimbo on em'
I got no words for these niggas I'm instrumental on em'
Yeah! And I'll still keep goin', keep flowin'
Can't help but think about it all the time
You know what's on my mind
I told her "recognize Smith and Wessen"
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
What is you discussing?
Hey, oh no, not another line about how life's a bitch
Well fuck the world and enjoy it
If she is, wonder can she ride the dick?
If so, I take her on a voyage
I like 'em long-legged, mega thick
Work it out, you know, employ it
You wanna know how I know I'm the shit?
Cause I keep clogging up the toilet
Coley Cole, fresh as a 4-week old
Not a scratch on me, hoes ask for me
Niggas ask about me, silly if you doubt me
Close your eyes and see where the game is headed without me
Give you the real, this nigga give you the chills
You looking at the reason the label give you the deal
You remind them of me, let's see, how does it feel
To know I fathered you niggas and left you out of my will?
Ill
Enough of that bullshit cake rap
With your childlike scriptures
I'm busting off, nigga, take that
Don't let the limelight get ya
The hood say "We fucking with you Cole, see?
And we're gonna ride right with ya
Yeah, we know you got college degrees
But we got priors like Richard"
And here we are, raps just like CPR
Nigga turn on your TV, BET, you see a star
Me and my team like E.T., completely we be from Mars
Damn he got bars, as if he's speaking of CB4
Need a barrage of freaky broads to keep me hard
Like 3 Nicki Minajs, flow completely retarded
So I'm deeply regarded as one of the gods, and yes
Her ass clap and so that's a round of applause, I guess
Fayettenam, nigga
Hahaah uh
Carolina, nigga
Yeah, Yea, let's bring it in
Yea, this is for my niggas in the struggle
Uh, uh, uh
Nothing but sweat, tears
Just another perspective
Yo, uh
Lifestyles of the young, black and genius
Sons strapped with guns packed in jeans
And the blunts got my lungs black as Jesus, (yea)
Play where killers hung at and slung crack for leisure
And tell a nigga run that get gun clap for sneakers
Young niggas emulate what's coming out the speakers
So everything we learn came from rappers, not teachers
Cause if we can't relate, then how the hell you gonna reach us?
Surrounded by crooked cops and preachers, (yea) Who am I trusting?
No time to think about illegal when your stomachs touching
By any means, nigga, even if the gun is busting
I see the world for what it is now
I see the odds is looking slim for our kids now
Cause, uh, it wasn't set up for my people to rise, (yea)
My niggas slang, but I see the pain deep in they eyes
Niggas living like they don't give a fuck
And I don't blame 'em, it's a cold world, live it up! (live it up)
The things that I've seen, (seen)
The dreams that I dream, (dream)
The rain in my sky
The pain in my eyes
But know that it gets better baby
Hope that it gets better baby
Don't let this world break you, (you) naw, naw
Don't let them break you, (you)
I look up in the sky, see that ghetto bird circling
And rollers on the block, my niggas on the curb, cursing them, (fuck)
Another day in the ville, do I stay in and chill? (no)
Or go play in the field?
Help my mother paying these bills, you tell me, nigga!
We young, black, some strapped
Them whites got they lunch pack for school, we had our guns packed
And all a nigga wanna do is take his momma from that
But they'd rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back
You kill a nigga over beef and cheddar even better
Just one less coon they won't have to arrest soon
Fuck a crooked cop three times
Bitch, I'm getting cake and ain't a nigga finna eat mine
That's why a nigga looking like a street sign, (yea)
Posted on the corner 'til it's sleep time
Wake up and it's feeling like somebody hit the rewind, (why)
Cause them ghetto birds circulate, my niggas still cursin em
Another day in the city, my niggas say it with me, yea!
Hope that it get better baby
It’s ya nigga, deep thinker, big drinker
Late night, with ya wife in ya crib sneaker
When you out of town, and you not around
Turn your ass over like a nigga stepped out of bounds
Crowd around young’n
I got ammo and a lot of rounds coming
Up in the streets where you not allowed, runnin’
Got the songs bitches ride around hummin’
And the niggas stay thumpin’
And the hater’s hate pumpin’
Got the 808′s bumpin’
So the trunks stay thumpin’
And the nigga get high only on occasion and
My mind too wild
Damn thought weed supposed to calm you down
But I’m so high I could palm two clouds
Boy look, these niggas quote my lines like the Lord’s book
You niggas less rhymes more hooks
More bucks but less love
You hear them drums, Questlove
No Roots, I’m so truth
I used to rock sidelines like a coach suit
Had to look at all them loafers, yeah them boat shoes
Now I’m in the game but I won't boast to you dummy
Remember niggas had short jokes for my money
Toast to the honeys, money and the liquor
And bitch I don’t sound like any other nigga
With my finger on the trigger
I burn rappers like Henny on the liver
Grant death wishes like a genie I’m a killer
Lord giveth and he taketh like an Indian giver
Hard to keep jimmy in zipper
When you got them bad Aunt Vivians with ya
Remy and weed, I got em on Pluto
I prefer Henny but the hoes like Nuvo
Ayy, yeah
That new Rihanna shit
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?
I guess they know that I'll cut a bitch
Boy, I'm already paid, getting money for the fuck of it
I'm on some other shit
So if you fly, what am I, do that make me the mothership?
Beam me up ho, they wanna see a nigga down
Take his crown, we be up doe, yeah we be up ho!
Now hit the ground, bow down to the sound
Good God
I guess they know that I'll cut a ho
Yeah I cleaned up good but I'm still out the gutter though
Don't forget this shit
You gotta problem? Then meet me outside if you with the shit
I've seen where the players sit
A couple racks gone just to watch 'Bron hit the layup, shit
I be on some nigga shit
But bitch, I'm way past nigga rich
I guess they know
Heard she hating though, feel no ways
I ain't fuck with that bitch, no way
Said that shit to my face, no way
Bet we shut down the place, no way
Bitches stuntin' on me, no way
They ain't fucking with me, no way
Price of fame, it ain't cheap, no way
I don't check the receipt, no way
Cole World, used to stay off his dick
A nigga getting cream like an old-ass Laker
But I ain't come to talk about all that paper
That's what they talk about when they ain't got shit to say
Can't understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know they sayin' same shit, nigga, different day
Cuz on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows, hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish n' chips
Why I do a lot of shows, I'm the shit that's it
Never stingy with the hoes, word to Cliff and Chris
If I fuck six bitches I got six assists
Yeah, Hey, Warmup
Hey yeah
J. Cole, cause I got it yea
Hey warm up, yea hey uh yea
Cause I got it
I remember me and my niggas goin' hard on that BlackPlanet shit
Was finna go to college, need a BlackPlanet chick
While you was playin' hard like a BlackPlanet Crip
Talk that shit in real life I had to backhand a bitch
Remember back in '99 my favorite rap Canibus
Bomm Sheltuh was the shit, Nervous Reck and the clique
Put the battery in my back, gamme' the gat and the clip
Now these hoes want a nigga phone number and a dick
'Memba back in '98 that's when I first planned this shit
Watch when I hit the streets these new niggas can't exist
When ya'll was wearin' rap diapers I was tearin' down cyphers
This ain't no overnight I put in time like a lifer
'Memba back in middle school they used to think that I was hyper
Now I throw the Ritalin in my flow, get 'em hyper
Watch for vipers, that girl is a snake
He gon' wife her, shit
You know powder blue suit, white Nike her
Hey she that nigga leftovers
You the microwave
The bitch done seen more clubs than Tiger, (aye)
Get a driver plate, while he drive away
Yea you was almost fly but your flight delayed
A little late boy
Me and my niggas been eatin' off little plates boy
And yeah I'm hungry so trust me don't feel safe boy
This is Carolina's finest
I'm high without the marijuana, honest, I promise
Yea, you know that I got it
Yea you know man
I'm a sure shot right now homie, I got it
Ay 1996, my own room now, I'm hangin' posters up
Holes up in the wall my stepfather said I ain't supposed to
But I'm hoop dreamin', hangin up pictures of my idols
Jordan was like Jesus, SLAM was like the Bible
I used to read it twice and cut the pictures out
Had the Jordan free throw dunk tongue stickin' out
Focused tryna' figure out, should I leave it here or move it there
Even hung them shits on the ceiling
I had to use a chair
Cause I was only like eleven, ain't even had no pubic hair
Told my mama when I make the league I promise you a crib
And I meant it, was ill wit the pill
Real skinny nigga, you couldn't tell me I wasn't a little Penny nigga
Pictures of Reggie Miller, even David Robinson
Kobe with the half-fro Stackhouse and Iverson
Was all over, reflectin' my life, boy, you heard me
Top it off I throw on my Carolina jersey, fo' real
Nigga, I thought I was going To Carolina Nigga (I got it)
I coulda swore I was gunna be a Tarheel, Nigga, Dean Smith Nigga, You know?
It didn't take long though,Figured I'm not balling my nigga
Look I'm 13 now ain't shit the same
Yea nigga still hoopin' but the shit done changed
I got a new love, addicted to rhymin' it's like a new drug
Plus a nigga sick with it
I'm fuckin' whole crews up
And all hell, I started studying my idols
Pac was like Jesus, The Source was the Bible
I know my Mama wonderin', what the fuck is this about
Cause all that basketball shit on my wall was gone
Replaced it with pictures of some rappers with firearms
And plus a couple posters of bitches posing in thongs,
You niggas was mowing lawns I was in here writing songs PUT ME ON
I just wanna be the best for real
I wasn't doing it for no money or no fuckin' girls
Back then I knew I was the nicest nigga in the Ville
Right now I feel like I'm the illest nigga in the world
The World world word
Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system
DJ OnPoint
Damn, broke as a bad joke
But still I laugh though, frontin' tryna have hope
It's sad though, I'm tired of being broke as shit
I'm seeing other niggas ball and I'm like 0 for 6
Ayy, man, I just graduated, good old college degree
Shit, my niggas drug dealing see more dollars than me
I know my calling, it's in my blood to do this music thing
Won't be that illest nigga that you never knew his name
I'm looking at these fake A&R's like, "You a lame
That boy a genius and you ain't even listen, man, you insane"
But you'll see though, just what the hell a nigga 'bout to be though
So give me one year then play this back like TiVo
'Cause boy I'm finna blow, I'm a motherfuckin' torpedo
The music's in my blood so watch these niggas turn mosquito, uh
I play the villain and the hero, some grow man shit
Feel like a goddamn kid, man I'm Pac and Big (What up?)
"Up" is something that I can't give
Won’t see me disappear like the old Aunt Viv'
'Cause even on a slow jam, I'm so damn sick
Man I even spread a virus to a program, quick
I gotta focus on my flow and get some dough, man, shit
No dollars got me actin' like I got no damn sense
But peace to my broham's and to my ex-lady
Yeah we been complicatin' things with the sex lately
Maybe I'm being selfish, but nah, I can't help it
'Cause girl we go back like a throwback Celtic, Jersey
Regardless of where God lead us
Just know that I was Martin and you was my Gina, uh
But I'm through living in the past, Lord
No more thinking rewind, I'm more fast forward
Less rear-view mirror and more dashboard
I'm visualizin' cash and stamps on a passport
That CLS with a full tank of gas for it
Cop my mom a whip, nigga, and she ain't even ask for it
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon' get my mama out the struggle
Said I'm wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon' get my mama out the struggle, nigga
I'd like to welcome ya'll to
My life, my life, my life, my life, in the sunshine... (Okay, in the sunshine)
Everybody loves the sunshine
This is the come up, nigga, uh, sunshine
Ayo real quick man
Y'all be a part of this experience man, The Come Up
While we gettin' outta here, I just wanna give a few shout outs man
(Sunshine) First and foremost man, my fam man, my mother my brother man
(Folks get down in the sunshine) God nigga, yes God nigga
For real my brothers from another mothers man, RJ man
(Sunshine) Mike Shaw, what it is man, Dreamville all day, we not
(Folks get down in the sunshine) We callin’ that shit Fayettenam, nigga
But we also callin' that shit Dreamville
Nigga, you got a dream, you can get the fuck ‘bout outta yo situation, nigga
Shout out to By Any Mean, my nigga Ebro man
Them two nice niggas, man
All the way, all terrain music all day
(There’s trees and plants and flowers) It’s a beautiful life man
From Rags to Riches, watch me man
(There’s trees and plants and flowers) From Rags to Riches
I'm on The Come Up
Chill nigga, don't run up
A yellow nigga, finna rise and shine like the sun up
My mind on that paper, I ain't trying to wife the slut up
I'm dying for this cake and I ain't trying to wipe a crumb up
They ride with the gun up, kill you and light the blunt up
Uh, don't shed a tear if a nigga might get done up
But, just say a prayer if a nigga might confront us
Cause his life is summed up, the medics wipe his lungs up
You coming to the 'Ville? You need to get a license from us
City on my back, I feel like I'm holding Big Pun up
No pain no gain, my nigga, I just numb up
I blow brains, Cobain a nigga if he jump up
With no shame, don't blame a nigga if you shot up
This is cocaine on flame, baking soda and water
And if you feel that then I guess I sell crack, get it?
Fall back, man, a nigga feeling crazy
Shitting on niggas like a nigga was still a baby
Carolina nigga shout-out to the 'Ville that raised me
So many hoes whipped, you would've thought we still in slavery
And niggas still sleepin' they feelin' lazy
Uh, a killer maybe, you make me I will
Cheat me on my scrilla, I send you to meet Dilla
From them NC streets where the beef they deliver
And the clip is on E cause your chest got a fill up
While a nigga like me is just getting head like a pillow
Bread like gorillas getting bred
So long as my momma and my niggas getting fed
Fuck what a nigga said, man, I'm Fayettenam bombing
Cause hatred is flattery you bitch niggas is charmin'
Who the fuck you harmin'? Boy, ya'll niggas is charmin'
And I'm armed and waiting for a target
You fucking with the best like Carmen
Aw shit, pardon a nigga for departing
I'm just getting green like a yard or a garden
A nigga finna blow while you niggas is false alarmin'
And just think, man, I was raised on ramen -- chicken noodle soup
Now I'm filet mignon-in'
I promised my momma I was coming to make this money
And I swear I'm going to kill the nigga that try to take it from me
Yeah, that's real talk, nigga
It's J. Cole, nigga
Therapist whatever the fuck you wanna call him, it don't matter
You know, I'll make y'all niggas understand man
I know you can't believe yourself right now
You thinkin' this niggas from the south, hahaha
He can't spit, how the fuck is he so good?
Open your eyes motherfucker, can you see? Niggas on top
Yup, we on top
Who dat who dat?
Back up on my 1, 2, 3 metaphors
I'm rhyming with CD, you would think I'm in stores
And y'all know me, I'm D-O-P-E
Screaming skins all day, no MTV
I see a girl giving out blows like a prize fighter
I'm on top of the words: call me a highlighter
Oral sex in the morning: that's a head start
Words like bullets, yeah I'm shopping at a Lead Mart
State of the Tar Heel, fuck how y'all feel
Young but I'm good, I got that fuckin John Wall feel
While y'all pissed off, I sit and sip Cristal
Hornet's nest flow, I assist like Chris Paul
Flow like a quick river, lines like a stick figure
So many drinks, I'll probably borrow someone else's liver
And I'm warming up just like a fireplace
I know I'm an acquired taste, go ahead and try to hate
But I'm just a brainiac who don't know where his brain be at
I'm smoking Huckleberry so I guess I'm Mark Twaining that
They told me I was insane, in fact
I'm tryna get my train on track
So you should probably counteract
The fact that you attacked the Datt
Who dat who dat? You know what you been waiting for
I mean, the game was all bad just a week ago
Rappers was bullshit - listen, I ain't hating, no
Now a brother, hot enough to fuck with one of satan's hoes
Wishing for air conditioning
Feeling god would never listen
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention
Man, just look at how I elevated
Then I redecorated; that means my tables turned
Just try and fail, clientele the only way to earn
So if you're selling crack or if you're selling rap
Make sure it's mean so the fiends keep on yelling back
I won't steal your girl? Test me
I stay Childish, watch me breast-feed
Grandfather ran numbers a criminal in Harlem
The only thing he used to make was trouble and my father
Father had me, said "Stay away from cocaine!"
Blood stained gangster, my swag screams dope game
I talk real nigga, this is what you ask for
I shit green like vegetarian assholes
Louder than Wayne's pants at the VMA's
Stick to what you good at nigga! Oh, everything?!
Niggas want me everywhere, I'm yelling out "Sorry!"
There's only one of me like white girls with black Barbies
Niggas mad that I ain't do shit too
I got a fly Asian bitch, that's a Shih Tzu
Throwing out your jazz man, but you don't look like Uncle Phil
Fucking girls from TV shows, my DVR is on the pill
Shake it on Youtube, yeah that's a VEVO ho
Black guy with a white voice, Cleveland Show
I don't know, all I wanted was different things
Hope these hood niggas don't blow me off when they're listening
All I do is wear what white guys wore in the '50's
And for some reason these white people think that it's interesting
Too many girls, that's still not enough for me
I love pussy like that old lady up the street
Everything I spit is compilated and best of
Black nerds run shit, go and ask Questlove
I'mma hit it twice, retail
I got a package like a gansta, G-mail
Google and a penis reference, same sentence, goody goody!
I love my dick so much they let a nigga host the Woodies
Got a whole barbershop like, "Oh man, this shit is tight!"
Solid shit.. one wipe..
Maine on fire, my empire be higher
Than an octave on Mariah, you niggas should worship sire
Your crew holding dead weight like a fuckin' hearse's tire
Meanwhile I'm like the flow diversifier verse is flyer
Gave you truth at a time when niggas prefer the liars
I was David promising the world that I'mma serve Goliath
Then I swam with sharks, made it to the land and parked
My dick in bitches with intentions sick as satan's worst desires
Hell of a intro speedin' through this life at a hell of a tempo
Get my head out the window
20k in my pocket as im feeling the wind blow
And I ain't have a wallet since Nintendo, comprendo
Orchestrating these capers watch my paper crescendo
I used to wanna save the world, now all I do is spend dough
Till I snap back like Hov hat
Now I'm back with this big black strap like hol' that
Maine on fire
Top down bitch i ain't no liar
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher
Every week can see my name on flyers
Henny by the shots many bottles pop
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar
We collect a hundred thou
Getting over on promoters might as well say run it now
I was such a cunning child
The one your girl mama wish she brought back home instead of you
The one your mama glad you hung around
Cole a charming nigga that can harm a nigga
Chest out in your hood like I walk around with armor, nigga
But its just me and all my nigga's and we fuck the baddest
Bitches on the planet witnesses this is
Hustle at its, finest cause while you nigga's chase vaginas
We just let the paper blind us
While vaginas chase behind us
Take notes make money don't make jokes
For the master grab his rope and make us all scapegoats
Real shit but if the world really bout to end
We might as well let my nigga Craig out the pen
Pain so deep the words bled out the pen
And maine don't sleep nigga I win then come again
Aye baby tell me have you ever seen a nigga chasin' dreams
Leavin' everything he love behind to make this cream
Kisses his momma on the cheek, say, don't worry I'll be back
I gotta get you out this shit, I'm a hurry, I'll speed back
You see, that's the type of shit the boy be thinkin' when he dreamin'
And he don't pay no mind to them niggas that's disagreein'
Sayin', nigga, is you crazy
Them same ones that's talkin' be the same ones not doin' shit
Aye, nigga is you lazy
Or is you scared to follow dreams
I know you gotta have one
The opportunities be in yo' face
You gotta grab one nigga
But while you're bullshittin'
I'll be woodgrippin' gettin' wealthy
On the road to riches, God help me
I'll holla at ya'll niggas when I see you, wouldn't wanna be you
Cause you fear what I don't, see this here is what I want
So I'm a get it poppin', I'm rockin' despite the obstacles
Look, my nigga what you call impossible is possible
Aye, tell my niggas to keep they heads up
We made it too damn far just to give it up
And we way too strong
This is a song for the Ville
And baby don't cry, you know I'm comin' back
I did it for the city, gotta get up on the map
And I know we gon' shine
This is a song for the Ville, yeah
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressin', I know it's temporary
Starin' at my granny obituary
She almost made it to eighty before they buried
Damn, can't even tell you I'm sure I'll to make it to 30
Cause you never know, sometimes life takes a turn for the worst
Is you holdin' on to will, or did you let it go
Heaven knows I'm tryna hold on
So every night I pray and hope my life is prolonged
The journey seemed so long but hold up
Don't take me up
I got big dreams nigga, ya'll can't wake me up
Life's a bitch but death don't break me up, I got too much to live for
It seems too many niggas die with way too much potential
Gotta get up out this trap even if I got to scrap
I'll lay a nigga down flat before I'll let him hold me back
Ya see I ain't afraid of obstacles
But what you niggas call impossible is possible
Yeah, so aye
Aye, some niggas take they life for granted, wastin' time
Time is money my nigga, I cannot waste a dime
Or a minute, too much business to handle to be sleepin'
Too much spinach to eat for niggas beefin'
So I'm out here trick or treatin', can my niggas comprehend
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, motherfucker let me in
Stop hatin' that's a sin, why these niggas so sinful
I guess they hate to love a nigga, yes it's that simple
As I ride through the city, feelin' lucky to be breathin'
I know a couple peers that didn't make it to the season, pour it out
See I believe that things happen for a reason, no doubt
Strange times, as I watch these niggas throw they gang signs, and they strapped
Crips or Blood, nigga we all black
From the same city, the same schools we was taught at
Aye fuck the drawbacks and obstacles
Man what them teachers call impossible is possible nigga, yeah
Is the whole world gunnin for me
Or is it just all in my mind?
If you want it, come and see me
I ain't got nothin but time
One day youre gonna set me free
But first you got to let me shine
Niggas ain't high as I be
See, look mama I’m flying
To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland
I’ll probably never land
Neverland, Neverland, no, I’ll never ever land
Check my fortune cookie, it say Cole World
Could that mean it's meant to be?
So much drive a nigga could've been a chauffeur
This life is fuckin with me mentally
Fake niggas try to act like they're a friend to me
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemy
My good girl say they want to know the inner me
My bad girl saying "fuck all that, enter me"
Double shots, Hennessy, bring out bad tendencies
Try to cut somethin, need a volunteer, Tennessee
Anything to take my mind off
I logged on and made them motherfuckers sign off
I got them on my dick, they’ll never climb off
I switch watches yet I never took time off
I don’t know what's worse, fake friends or fake fans
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn
I’m sortin' through this
Organized confusion to get my thoughts together
This shit is soundin' like a movie you can watch forever
I got to make it to the top, it's either now or never
These other niggas can't adapt because they're not as clever
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt it's better
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter?
Cole World, snow flurries in the hottest weather
And so sick they can’t fix this with modern medicine
We at your door and she's got to let us in
It’s what you want, I whet your appetite
Cole hit the scene now I’m what everyone rapping like
Shame you feel you have to bite
Still ain't nobody snapping right
Pedal to the metal as I’m speeding through the traffic lights
Bitch I got to catch a flight, come on already
Still fight like I’m the underdog, I’m on already
Got a few niggas we about to prove wrong, y'all already already
Yeah, um
Ayy, y'all still got that falcon special?
No
What the fuck you mean you ain't got the spalcon special?
Alright, never mind
Let me get a ten piece nuclear, extra wet
And don't have my fries soggy
Last time I came here my fries was extra fuckin' soggy
Y'all rice fresh?
Aw, hell nah, you hesitated
Man, anyway, let me get a ten piece lemon pepper, extra crispy
Another ten piece
Man, bitch, I want half and half
Barbecue, don't forget the fries
Oh, lemon pepper, half mild, wet
Add an extra fry too
'Cause y'all be skimpin'
I don't wanna hear none of that shit like y'all did last time, for real
Ayy, add a twenty piece teriyaki
Oh yeah, don't forget any my drinks either
More liquor when we ride
Toast niggas, we alive
Golddiggers look inside, I ain't in the back
Me? I’m in the front seat, driving like I’m 1 deep
If you want to come see, you know where I’m at
Go-getters on tha rise, toast niggas we've arrived
Old niggas step aside, ain't no coming back
Big thangs on my mind, switch lanes and recline
Get brains from a dime, how you love that?
Alone in my zone, tell me don’t it sound stunning
Been fucked the world but she just now coming
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground running
I ain't never been the one for fourth down punting
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I’m crown hunting
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lockpick just to lock shit back
I want "Money, Power, Respect" since The Lox said that
Better stay up on ya toes, this is not tic tac
Yeah, I’m a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Balling like a Laker, you should pray for next year
Cause I’m repeating and I’m 3-peating
And I’m knee-deep in the game
It's quick sand and I keep sinking
The label heat seeking, nigga ain't sign me
What the fuck was he thinking?
They say I killed the game, that was only preseason
I’m heavy
Lil' nigga I’m heavy
I’m so heavy, I’m feeling heavy
Carolina I’m heavy
In New York I’m heavy
Out in LA I’m heavy
I’m so heavy
No album to my name and I’m already hot
You can say I’m pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling yours be seated
Cut my leg off I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in tha game bitch and you can retweet it
Email that shit, make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don’t want to believe it
I'll be in the airport damn near barefoot
Security hollering out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I dont even be weeded
No point drinking I can’t even be faded
Real recognise real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I’m glad to be hated
Fucking bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it
My money was running late now it’s happy belated
I'm heavy
Nigga I'm heavy
Hey, I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy
Lil' nigga, in New York I'm heavy
Queens, I'm feeling heavy
Fayet-nam nigga, I'm so heavy
I'm feeling heavy
Lil' nigga I'm heavy
(Coast to Coast Instrumentals)
I don't know what the hell that is
Should have just called Puff for the fucking instrumental
Fuck it, no time for that boy!
They say we living in troubled times
Aye, do you see the trouble signs?
Aye, lifes a bitch, and I'm cuffing mines
My dough in flipmode, what up to Busta Rhymes
I used to never see green, I was colorblind
Now I get my hustle on
Pay dues like a hair salon
My way like a Usher song
Higher power where these verses from
You niggas hoes, put your purses on
Church, get your worship on
Born alone, work alone, die alone
Hot fire like Dylan
Bitches get their dial on
Fake niggas get dial tones
I ain't no Viacom nigga
I'm a fire arm, nigga
Look how I alarm niggas
Watch my dope pile on
'Til it's like a mile long
Niggas couldn't fill my shoes
Couldn't even try 'em on
Showed your lil' ass look
That's how you take it
Two-facing niggas, couldn't tie my shoe laces, boy!
That was the warm up, this is the blow up
Now if you ain't talking no bread boy, ain't no need to show up
Man they say I'm repping the Ville too much, but fuck it, so what?
When my niggas carrying toys like they don't wanna grow up
When my sisters drinking like fishes and won't even throw up
Let's po' up, get to' up, know the police gon' show up
I slow up
Some niggas ain't got no luck
Some niggas can't get no love
Some of 'em can't get no bucks
So tell me what do a nigga do if he can't get a job?
My brother got him an interview, but he can't get a ride
What's up God?
No this ain't no Wu-Tang shit
This is my lil' fire drill, just some routine shit
Just to shoot fiends with
And hold 'em off a lil' longer
Every verse I write I swear I'm only getting stronger
Can you ponder?
Imagine what my shit gon' sound like
If I told you that The Warm Up was just a sound bite
Damn right, believe I put it down right
And I'll be sure to tell you lil' niggas what that crown like
I showed you love, I brought you through
I gave you pounds right?
Aye, in my face, you knew your place
And so you smile right?
So why I'm here, and now you talking like a little girl?
You sound like Whitley, nigga
Me? I'm from a different world
Your shit is garbage
If I drop you, I'm a litterbug
Busy getting money
I ain't fucking with that Twitter, girl
Fuck what they say, wishing me harm and sorrow
They here today, bet they be gone tomorrow
They catching Z's on me, aye we gon' call 'em Zorro
I'll let you sleep today, but it's on tomorrow
Yeah, I said it's on tomorrow
I'm coming for the game
And I ain't talking loan or borrow
Pray for the days I get cash, checks and never weary
This the last stretch, I'm a half step from legendary
Don't even know if summer gon' feel me
So many sides to a nigga
I wonder who's the real me
Tired of fightin'
Tired of always trying to enlighten
Hit the blunt that I am lightin'
To catch a spark cause I'm writin'
Some shit that'll cause a riot
Or make a war go quiet
Make a fat cat diet
Make the square bitch try it
Make a cheapskate buy it
Tell me who as high as this
Balenciaga kicks for kicks
Tell me who fly as this
Effortless, got dressed quick
You niggas stress at this
An hour on your outfit and
You still can't impress a bitch
I cruise through the city so mean
Gangster lean, with no promethazine
So obsessed with cream
I done hit the lottery in my dream like four times
Took a minute but I burst on the scene in '09
Now tell these hoes meet me and please be on time
She come up out the jeans, and it seems she want mine
For her unborn child
Girls gone wild meets black girl lost
She got the type of body, piss fat girls off
This ain't love dove, this lust
Do you know how fast that wears off
Let me take you back to queens
Where a nigga was a king, uncrowned
Country boy, new kid in town
Ran the streets after sundown
Hit the spots you wouldn't come around
Same block that Sean Bell was gunned down
Told that hatin' ass cop harrasin' me cause I am black
"You ain't have to do that man like that
The nigga ain't even do a crime, yet you squeeze 50 times"
He turned to me with a smirk "51 to be exact", damn
Cole world, no cupid
Got drama with these niggas fronting like they so ruthless
Ok I am supposed to like your record
Cause you got a little record
Tell me do that make you real
Or just real fuckin' stupid
Nickel and Dime nigga
Came back with the hustle but get with the times nigga
You live in rewind nigga
Real niggas believe in me
Cause ain't nobody seein' me
And the way I shine is intended to blind niggas
And I am ghost
Disappear like Copperfield in the six
Switch gears and cop a feel for your bitch
Yeah that yellow bone thing, that's my honey
Everytime my fucking telephone ring it's about some money
And you know that, nigga
You know that
Nobodies feelings getting hurt, nobody getting mad
Black heaven is a place where people like me go
Up there in black heaven, black heaven
Where do my niggas go to when they pass?
And why do good niggas never last?
Some get addicted to the fast route
The hand in hand, you know that cash route
I pray to God that we see better days
I caught a record while the record plays
I'm thinkin' Lord don't let 'em carry me
See I know one day when they bury me
I'll go straight to black heaven, black heaven
Yeah I go straight to black heaven, black heaven
Don't let the paranoia get to me
Can't take a trip to penitentiary
I make a flip and take the summer off
A half a brick? Now that's a somersault
I look to God, it's been along road
I got my braid up, like a cornrow
I've been through hell, one day I'll find my way
If not then maybe I can buy my way to black heaven
Yeah, hahaha
Real niggas can relate, yeah
Hahaha, Ville niggas can relate, man
Yeah, yeah, uh
I see you looking at me hard shawty, what it's gonna be?
But you right next to your man, don't let him run up on me
'Cause I see him tryna grill, better take his ass home
Before I lay his ass out, then I take ya ass home
I even gon' front man a nigga tryna cut
I ain't tryna take his place, I just want to hit you up
When that nigga ain't around I just want to pick you up
Bring you back to the crib, sip a little liquor up
Then I give you a massage, get you wet, get you up
Then I give you what you want, if it's clean I lick it up
Now you can do me, if it's right my shit is up
Face down on your stomach, take that ass and lift it up
Then I do my thang, now shawty listen up
Yeah, your pussy do bang, got no problem hooking up
Just remember why I call ya, and why we getting up
I ain't tryna be ya man, I ain't tryna split you up
'Cause I do my thang, now shawty listen up
I be that nigga on the side when you feel you want to creep
When you in the bed alone why ya man run the street
All you got to do is dial, let the phone ring twice
Baby girl I love your style, I won't even think twice
I ain't even gonna front, man a nigga tryna beat
I ain't tryna wife you up, though you is a dime piece
I just love the way you ride like a certified freak
How you throw it right back, got a niggas thighs weak
So just hit me when you want it, you know how to find me
Got no times for no games, you know how the grind be
But-I'm a make the time if you bout' it dial me
I'm a make you say my name like a caller ID
Give you money to get ya hair did-he can do that!
Pay for dinner and a movie-yea he can do that!
Work you out in the bed-maybe he can do that
But I know you much rather call me to do that
And girl I'm with it! Haha, yea
I'm so with it, babygirl I'm so with it!
So let me hit it!
If looks kill then Melanie you a felony
We both hot I guess we couldn’t take the jealousy
All in my ear I had my homeboys telling me
How to be a player, we fell off like Bill Bellamy
MTV shhh, we used to watch Law and Order, NBC shh
But now I’m watching solo on some empty seat shit
Thinking of you, I got a lot more drinking to do
Reminiscing, though I seen it coming
Yeah I had a premonition
Right beside each other and somehow it felt distant
Lets rewind back when days sunny like Liston
Smile just glisten, your booty like a cushion
Is this the moment where we making up
And realise we tripping forever breaking up
And then I break you off, put you to sleep
Know its deep when the girl of his dreams is the same one to wake him up
So peace shawty, but CÎROC I got peach in it
Everything at ease, you in double M G presence, Ralph
You ain't heard, a nigga like me
Been around the world twice sipping ice tea
Come with me, to Madrid that's where Real play
Quit the job baby, come and fuck me all day
You see my lifestyle's been nothing but lifestyles
Late nights and early flights, rushing right now
But she, gotta have that, grab that, what's that? Long?
Automatic, cut that, flush that, gone!
And I don't wanna be a playa no more
Okay I'm lying, but I'm trying
They say the money talks and bullshit walks
Have amazing conversation while we flying, I ain't lying
Haha uh
Yeah, Yo
Bear with a nigga man
Gotta a little head cold, ya know?
I'll still kill it nigga
Show y'all niggas how it do
Real Quick
Uh You know what they say;
The window to the soul is in the eyes
So disrespect a nigga, I will close a nigga blinds
Yeah who can hold us? Super focused
Shoot them hoes with the Super Soakers
I got 'em so wet
Fuck that Moet, I'm Hennessy drinking
Wonder what my enemies' thinking
Nervous? nigga, please
I'm finna be caking with dough-
So much bread, its like a nigga be baking
Watch so cold, it's like the shit will need blankets
Money coming soon, tell my niggas be patient
We gonna replace those whips with some sicker ones
We gonna erase them chicks for some thicker ones
Hit and run, bigger funds
But still can't forget to pour liquor
As I reminisce on them niggas that couldn't come
Rest in peace, can't control another man's destiny
So I do what's best for me
I know you fake niggas well, ain't no test to me
On my plate is a meal, ain't no recipe for that
So nigga chill or the tec will speak, "Blaaat!"
Them niggas will put you chest to feet
I'm talking reckless
What you expect nigga, I'm flexing
Y'all dyslexic, got a nigga twisted
Never shot a nigga, I don't gotta get convicted
Cause if I say the word, your whole squad is getting lifted
What up then? Niggas ain't saying nothing? Shut up then!
Wouldn't last a minute in the city I grew up in
Where I got my swag, cool as the breeze is
Chip on my shoulder, I walk like I'm Jesus
About that paper, we could give a fuck if you believe us
Looking for model divas that barely speak English
Fuck 'em while we rich, cuz when we broke, they gonna leave us
We earn stripes, looking like zebras
Y'all looking like Adidas
We do it for the streets, cuz they need us
Got beef? Come meet us
Ok I thought so
Y'all niggas are so mad cuz I floss so bad on bitches
And with this stroke, I'm Picasso
Make her stomach feel the fossil
Now she yelling out God so much thought I had her singing gospel

Dear Mr. Policeman
Am I wrong, ain't you supposed to keep the peace, man?

Or cause I'm black, hmm, maybe?
Tell me why my hands start sweating and I hold my breathe every time you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won't hear a sound, man I'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pull me over, ya frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me, what do you see?
Thug niggas, drug-dealers its a trip
Every nigga in this whip got a mothafuckin' college degree

My teacher said, "Impossible", but I'mma fuckin' try
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules
There's niggas dying everyday, we don't make the news

Top story: Tiger Woods be fuckin' a these white hoes
Anchorman stop snitchin'
Cut to commercial, he be textin' all his side bitches

Are you perfect mothafucka? How you finna to judge me?
These cops is Bad Boys, they be just like Puff
They hate their jobs and their days be fucked up like us

You see this what I like to call - buyou music
'Cause you better buy you a car

And you better buy you some where to stay
Or I'ma walk right by you

Hey, hey, hey, yeeeah, Cole World

How you figure it's gon' last? He just sit up on his ass
And play that damn Xbox that you copped for him (Copped for him)
Buyou, buyou, how much to try you? (Hey)
Ain't sayin' you for sale, but baby, let's be for real
Buyou, buyou, shit that I could buy you (Hey)
These niggas all the same, either they Ken or Ryu
Stringin' you along, allow me to untie you
Vitamin D supply you, let them little boys walk by you
They frontin' cause they broke, but the numbers don't lie
If they swear they so fly, tell me why they never fly you?
Yes, straight out the Ville and I'm blessed
Never met death, well, at least not yet
Off to the place where they rest under flowers
Niggas get wetter, like sex in the shower
Dear Lord, what am I here for?
Is it the hoes? Or the money? Or is there more?
I know the world is going to come to an ending
Before it does can finish up my sinning?
I see the devil grinning, as if he was winning
This is the bottom of the ninth inning
I'm coming back like light skinned
What a sad sight, looking at my gas light
Like "Damn man, I just threw 10 in"
Look five dollars won't get you what it use too
And look, love don't mean what it use too
And everybody and their mommas on youtube
Is it just me, or is this unusual?
Don't wanna loose ya', just wanna reach ya'll
So let me slow down, to the beat ya'll
Put the remote down, move your feet dawg
One time for the niggas holding heat ya'll
Keep that tucked, 'fore somebody get hurt
See me, I rather cut catch her body give birth
If you were the last nigga walking on earth
Turn yourself and clap your hands like this was church
Trust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer
My nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, homie do what you like
(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!
My baby hope you ready, me and you both goners
But in the meantime, shawty do what you like
I say money make the girls go down
They say money make the world go 'round
So my broke niggas, ain't it a shame
If Bill Gates made it rain
Then world goin' drown
Can I get a dollar?
Shawty got a low Impala
Made that ass drop, hydrola', holla!
Know she got a man, and I don't understand
Why he don't grab that bitch by the collar
Follow, look uh
I need my women a little hood
Living in a world where bad means good
That explains why the bad hoes attract 'em
That explains why the bad rappers go platinum
Or gold these days, go DJ
If the world stops spinning like a old DJ
Keep playing, I need a little more time
Pre paying, just a few more dimes
We slaying, keep praying, hoping
2012? You gotta be joking!
Ain't enough time and a nigga trynna' sign
But +The Whole World+ done lost they minds
Look, bombs over Baghdad, bullets in the Ville
This is not a test, this is not a drill
This is all real so before we all kill
Let me get one more feel. Baby!

Hey, you know they say pain is pleasure
Turn it up when you play this shit
One time for my latest girl
You can be one of my greatest hits
Tired of rapping ’bout chains and whips
Do you like to get chained and whipped?
Do you like rough sex? Hit 'em like I’m upset
Do they get your panties wet?
Le-le-let's go, you rockin' with Cole, it's the best flow
Put the game on lock while those lame-os watch
I'm on fire, they are not, I kick down the door, they all knock
Bitch, I’m a boss, they on a clock
You used to be a good girl, don’t matter
Since you gone bad, you only got badder
Sticks and stones may break my bones but chains and whips excite me
Just one night full of sin
Feel the pain on your skin
Tough, I don't scream mercy
It's your time to hurt me yeah
If I'm bad tie me down
Shut me up, gag and bound me
'Cause the pain is my pleasure, nothing comes better
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
S, S, S and
M, M, M
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say ah, ah, ah
The game need balance, the game need balance
Woke up this morning to the rumors of niggas wilding
Picture me hating on a young nigga with talent
Album flop, but it's cool, he caked out on his allowance
I was out in Vegas, Kicks was the latest
Bitch was the baddest, her head was the greatest
Only one thing that I ask of you haters
You can't diss a nigga if you got him on your playlist
From straight A's to A-list, Only niggas with AK's can play this
My Jordan's thirteen like eighth grade, You niggas debaters
But you ignoring my pay raise
I made it from 8 dollars an hour, that's 400 a week
To 100 grand a show, that's 400 a week
Ice and wrist, It's Cole summer to keep
Life's a bitch, Just don't cum in the sheets
Riding 'round the town ducking my old bitches, old
Riding 'round the town ducking my old bitches
You ain't hold me down 'til a nigga came up
Why you want me now? What's the focus? Wait, I know
You was pressing dial and my name came up (right)
I've been off it and I've been gone for weeks, still smell the set up
Put her on repeat, can't put no pussy on a pedestal
I be home all week, so for a week she in stilettos
Call me when you need, only when you- ooh
Call me when you need, only when you-
Oh you heading out of town with your bestfriend

I knew you'd come back (come back)
I knew you'd come back (back)
I knew you'd come back, back

I'm going OT for the week
Double OT for the weekend
Got me a freak and she geeking
She talk a lot when she peaking
Speaking 'bout life, drama and her current affairs, let‘s bury it there
I got enough problems, got no worries or care, spare you an ear
And she think that's me on the internet
She don't know me that's the internet
She just get high off my intellect
I just get high tell her "give me neck"
My mind on this check (you know what I'm saying)
My mind on this check (just know I ain't playing)
My mind on this check (this money of mine)
My mind on this check (that's all on my mind)
Lust persists, why pretend?
I can't tell no lie, bitch I'm too poppin' now
Empty bottles, empty promises
Yeah, Pistol Pete flow, smoke like a swisha sweet blow
Cole world, get ya Pea Coat
Rappers got no point, niggas miss the free throws so
Ain’t no mystery why there picking me for
I’ve been hot since ’97, I ain't Mr Cee though
I am Mr NC boy, with the pen destroy any emcee boy
I’m skinny, didn’t eat so I’m hungry like a hostage
Finally seeing money so it’s funny how they eyes lit
Surprise it's, that nigga that you should have been on
I handed you niggas my demo, dawg I couldn’t get on
One time for my city bitch I’m putting it on
Like a condom when I’m with your girl, ballin’ like it’s intramural
Back in middle school, hoopin’ to impress the girls
We was young and disconnected from the rest of World
I reminisce on Andrea, eh, God bless ya girl
She used to let me sit in class and caress her curves
Help a nigga get through puberty, the lessons learned
From her, wasn’t nothing like it
We passed notes, she read minds like a fucking psychic and write back
I was the class clown, I told jokes and hope she liked that
Rode the bus home and wonder how it be to pipe that
If I was just a little faster I know I could have smashed her
But was just a virgin, couldn’t make it past flirting
Now I’m taking baths with their naked ass jerkin
"Make It Last Forever" playing in the background
You can take it as whatever I was laying that down
She gon' hate my ass forever, I ain't bring her back round
But hold up, what you expect it, how you feeling all neglected?
Sending all them text'es, spillin all your stresses
We knew just what this was before I was feeling on your breast’es
I never disrespected, I’m clever nigga check it
I tried to warn these women, guess they never get the message
This is Cole, ain't nothing like it
So girls don’t wanna fuck him, now they wanna f-ckin’ like him
And hope he fucking wife em
Yeah, nuttin’ like him
Yeah, ooh, yeah, oh
Ain't no other, ain't no other niggas
A-ain't no, ain't no other niggas fucking with me
Rappers throwin’ jabs but it feel like nothing hit me
Fake niggas, snake niggas I think something bit me
Scratch that, can’t impersonate perfection man
But I can school you, this here is the lesson plan
Now uh uh apparently, some of y’all comparing me
Either you blind as hell or either you just don’t care to see
Don’t make me pull the trigger I think you niggas is daring me
Go fuck around and get your new favorite rapper embarrassed, see
I’m the supplier of that fire and the kerosene
Don’t wanna make a scene, those ain't no shots fired
Just know the shit that I’m dropping, take you a lot higher
These niggas bitches on the low, they Mrs. Doubtfire
How can you doubt fire, man if you brave enough then come put it out Sire
The South by your side, this the mouth for your eyes
You niggas spit it with no one to vouch for your lies
I spit it how you see it, but ain't had the words to say it
I spit it how you think it but ain't had the balls to speak it
I put it out, sit around and let the world critique it
Until the fans up on it early like a nigga leaked it
Just know you fucking with the best, this be our little secret
Until the world find out and then y’all gotta shed me
Til then just know there's nothing like him and there's nothing near me
Yeah you fucking hear me, nigga
Yeah, yeh
Mama told me I was special
Gotta love her for that (yeah)
Yeah, truly yours, J. Cole
My mama coulda been a movie star
You know like Judy Garland
I went to St. Johns, I coulda went to Juliard
Cause my beautiful mind mixed with my musical bond
Deep as a funeral line, dawg, I get it from my mama
I used to be embarrassed getting picked up in that Honda
Thought my niggas might play me if they found out that my mama was a white lady
So like gravy, had to cover that
Plus my older brother black but he look white
In an all black school, picture what that look like
No wonder he was under-achieving, not believing in himself
Coming home, just be keeping to himself
Looking back through the silence, he was screaming out for help
Maybe this verse can find the words to get the demons out himself
So yeah, I’m exercising
Right now my record climbing, I’m sort of a stair master
Niggas got there faster, I took the long route, I never been a scared rapper
Boy this ain't Fear Factor, they tell me can you hear the wrath spilling out these paragraphs
Made the world clear a path
Bet I’ll be on top from now till the hereafter
I'm special, mama told me I was special
You know I love her for that
That's right, I’m special
Tell me, whats the marketing plan for realness?
What’s the demographic target audience for brilliance?
What's the first week numbers for my inspiration?
Who can A&R this passion and this dedication
Name: Omen
This ain't a verse, this a revelation
We need some more Sanaa Lathan’s in our population
I’m meeting women I would never date
The kind that say they want a marriage, but they really want a wedding day
I’m seeing groupies tryna act like they don’t notice me
But the writings on the wall call it hoetry
Desire calls, but that's not what my focus be
Music’s forever my lady unlike Jodeci
See when a leader's speaking, you should simply follow suit
I stay in the zone like it’s college hoops, let me show you how to shoot
You know aim for the goal, these are just the chronicles
They're calling me the Honorable, though I am not no Muslim
I’m finna blow like woodwinds, tricky like a good sin
I’m something you’ve mistooken, mistaked him for fakeness
Haters don’t know what you facing
Oh goodness, oh gracious
They looking at greatness
I was special, mama told me I was special
Gotta love her for that
Yeah, hey!
Hey, I'm just a Carolina nigga goin' hard for the 'Ville

So much bass, I mean niggas can't tell where the treble at
On the track, niggas can't keep up, they look, they trailin' back
Now these bustas couldn't catch up even if Id pedal back
Won't lose, bet on that! or be in debt forever
Plus whatever Jigga say, I'm hot
That's like the pot called kettle black
Now these industry niggas like damn, "Jay said all that? "
Same niggas could've signed me, now they gon regret all that
Bet on that! Bitch, this my beat, look how I get on that shit
I'm on it like I own it cus I sewn it
Needle and thread, hip-hop heads know them drums express youself
Aye look, I tried to school these niggas, they need extra help
I mean they just don't get the message dawg, no text could help
And now I'm on some 'fuck you niggas', go molest yourself
I'm tryna ball til I fall, catch myself, then ball again
Fall to the floor, dust myself, do it all again
Pardon him, sick nigga, never been a bitch nigga
Spit it for them ones like me who never been a rich nigga
Had the dream to make a team and get up off the bench nigga
You fuckin' with me, ya odds is slimma then a stick figure
Get bigga nigga
Hey, blood, sweat and tears, I paid my price
Hey, so come and get this good game
Aye you should come and get this good game
I pray for days and nights I gave my life
Hey, so you can come and get this good game
Think you should come and get this good game
Hey heeyy
I'm just a down south nigga, lil' east coast flow
From the concrete jungle where the trees don't grow
From the 'Ville, where the motherfuckin' streets so cold
Nigga I could show you streets where police won't go
We just tryna get a piece, my nigga we so po'
Why you lookin' at him, wonderin' why he sold dope
Or why she smoke crack? Or why he tote gats?
Gotta stay up on your toes cus if your feet both flat
A nigga heat gon' clap, your heartbeat go flat
The Lord giveth and he taketh, well he repo'ed that
They don't quiver, they don't shake, man they just reload gats
So much beef for a nigga to have a feast on that
Now a nigga like myself ain't had to keep no gat
But nowadays mo'fuckers is weak, won't scrap
So them OG's tell a nigga, "Please, roll strapped"
It's fucked up a nigga man it be's like that
It be's like that (Hey) and it be's like that (Hey)
Them boys from the 'Ville and yeah it be's like that

6 in the morning, I’m gonna call Wale
Tell J. Cole meet us down in the A
And bring Wiz Khalifa cause the green look pure
We some real niggas
We just looking in the mirror
I'm on fire, whole hood blazing
Hustle game incredible, ice game amazing
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Look's like a chandelier, look in the mirror
Eyes super clear, you looking in the mirror
Who you heard see when you look in the mirror?
If you a real nigga, you looking in the mirror
D.C. all up in this bitch
Bout time I got my respect
And now these hoes are on my line
Like Sally Mae on college debt
Gotti here, I’m in this shit
Here's your nigga, come hear this year
I bet you hear that white music
But I don’t mean Top 40 hits
Talk to the mirror
And I don’t need a cure
And when I’m done with this muthafucker
You’ll need an urn
Shopping I’ll be in Paris
Plottin' don’t even worry
You walk in my closet your favorite stylist will be emburrsed
You out where, we don't ever see ya
My niggas out here, they spot me like Chippy D
And I’m probably smoking reefer til I got that emphysema
How else can I emphasize I’ll only let the mirror see ya
It go microphone check, one, two, yola
Two chains, two guns, he bipolar
Two baby mamas, 3 kids, two Rovers
That's too many problems, too late to think over
The cars off the showroom, the clothes off the mannequin
Hoes out the centerfold, I be going in at em
One bitch from Howard, another bitch from Grambling
College girl going wild, we gonna need a camera man
Bird talk feather man, Louie jacket leatherman
Fresh to death that bullshit irrelevant
Man in the mirror, I can’t get my shot again
My bitch like a coke bottle, your bitch like a Pepsi can
Mirror mirror on the wall
Bitch, I was born to ball
While you took the summer off my money did a somersault
Backflips, cartwheels, Carolina Tar Heel
Ain't no nigga touching my style, it got a force field
Magneto, blew up like a torpedo
The view from my condo make hoes say "neato!"
Game strong like the arm on Marino
I stack Cheetos and Doritos like casinos
Fresh to death like I’m buried in a tuxedo
At times I look in the mirror to boost my fucking ego
I say it’s your World, Cole World to be exact
With a flow that’s so thorough, no sir you can’t re-enact
150 on my chain
Balling, but it’s not a game
High: that's why they call us planes
All the bitches know my name
I take em home, fuck her, get high and never call again
And my niggas all the same
Now that's what you call a game
Hundred thousand dollars and that’s on champagne
Bitches choosing their excuses: my new car’s to blame
Wanna dump a nigga, fuck a nigga with a lot of fame
Don’t want nothing from a nigga; he all kinds of lame
Try doing what you doing but it’s out of range
Niggas taking shots, don’t know how to aim
Don’t know bout you but I see a real nigga
When I’m looking in the mirror
With some diamonds in my ear muthafucker
All this fightin' shit I kinda love it
Them tears, at least you're feelin' somethin'
For a minute I felt you're goin' numb
No calls, did you get forget my number?
I, used to love you
Love you, love you, love you like you never been loved before
Now it's just fuck you
Fuck you fuck me like I ain't fucked up enough
Told me he hurt you before
I tried to be better, oh
Damn I got issues with hoes
In different area codes
With this good dick on they mind
But I'm supposed to be yours
Good God why can't I supply
Luh
All this fightin' shit I know you hate
All the points you make, I got debates
And we can end this if you want to
And I just say that shit to hurt you
And I, used to love you
Knowing what I know, I got to pray, I got to hope, I got to say I'm gonna make it out, yeah
Going with the flow, I got a plant inside my hands, I'm on my knees, I got to pray to God, yeah
And I don't see no other way, I gotta make it out, yeah
Can't live like this another day, I gotta make it out
Can't live like this another day
Uh yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
What am I here for?
I'm a man so I cannot let them tears fall
But understand trynna get my head clear ya'll
This shit is on my mind
Asking for the lord to show me all my signs
Show me something
Cause I'm trynna find something
I'm lost can you show me something
I sit and reminisce on them niggas no longer here
And how I used to hit the mall and ya was always there
I sit and think how I didn't grow up with my father there
No need to cry cause it only made me stronger yea
I watched my brother get in trouble with the law and yea
That shit cut me like I was sitting in a barber chair
Cause I don't want to see them locked up in them bars in there
And I don't want to see him stretched out in a coffin yea
I'm wishing I can move my momma out so far from here
I know that she deserve much better and she worked hard as hell
That's why you never see me settle cause they want us here
I'm trynna side step the devil but he heartless yea
But just know that I'm a rebel and yo it's almost here
I'm talking bout the revolution I am Paul Revere
So dry your eyes momma please you can pause them tears
Cause I promise I'm gon get us outta here
I'm gon get us outta here
I'm a man so I cannot let them tears fall?
But understand trynna get my head clear ya'll this shit is on my mind
I'm lost can u show me something
I swear I'm praying for my niggas when I say grace
I know them niggas don't care who they hit they spray strays
But lord please protect my family cause if they graze
Niggas is loading up that ammi and them A-K's
I know it's wrong and that revenge is all in your hands
But last night I heard they robbed and killed an old man
Now if they cold enough to take a life that's innocent
I know that they could give a fuck whether I live and shit
And so I'm asking you if you can hold me down lord
Be my umbrella-ella-ella in this downpour
I know you never ever ever let me drown or
Won't let that devil ever ever win this round naw
And though I stray for you, you know that my heart is good
And I know I ain't exactly living how I probly should
And I'm a try to act better like it's Hollywood
Niggas congratulate me I just tell them God is good
God is good
Yea, huh, yea my niggas drug dealing in the trap
I'm tellin you wake up nigga it's a trap
You set up and to them young mothers fed up
Just keep your head up
Don't let up
You fall you get up
You make your bed up that you sleep in
Fake rappers ain't practicing what dey preaching
Hey tell you hit the trap while they relaxing on the beach and
I'm here to spit the facts
A nigga backflipped off the deep end
I smell this shit for what it is
Not kells but I love the kids
And so I make the song to let em know that they important
Cause them racist teachers couldn't give a fuck bout wat they score is
So they try to get them hands up on them Grants like Horace
Now slanging for you knoe it cops is knocking they got warrants
Damn!, uh, and how he running for it
Damn!, yea and now the cops is running for him damn!
And now he finally slowing down
Hands behind your head, lay down on the ground, nigga
I'm tryna get with ya girl, I ain't even going stunt
Miss Fat booty, man I seen it from the front
I mean that shit was pumped, had me fiending from the jump
And that ass was right, shit would make a fag look twice
So I approach like “shawty , whats good with cha?”
Nigga was hopin’ to go back to the hood with ya
And yeah I see them other niggas tryna look at cha
Wouldn’t slang the thing right even if they could get ya
Me I’m from the Ville where we learn how to mack well
And you gon’ yell when I hit it from the back well
Take you to the crib and throw on a little Maxwell
Grab a condom know cause, shit, I don’t know you that well
Haa, was fucking with that
Far from hater but see dem brothers was wack
So don’t you worry bout them mean muggin’ girl
I’m tougher than that
And niggas mad cause this light skinned brotha is back
I’m sayin’ though
Stripes on the Polo
On the late night, fucking your wife on the low low
My pipe like a pogo stick, no homo
No ice but I’m cold though
Cologne on my nuts in case she might wanna go low
I’m from the Ville where niggas fight for the dolo
So think twice or take the same advice from the fo’fo’
Me running to PoPo and muthaf-ckin’ no go
A Carolina nigga, I’m the muthaf-ckin logo
Shit, fly as hell on my ozone shit
Disrespect me nigga you could get your cornroll split
And that goes for you too, I’m on my Bono shit
Niggas got no delivery thats that Digiorno shit
I got porno chicks callin’, I still neglect them nigga
I’m about my money like a bill collector
For you slow niggas I put it more in laymans
If you ain't talkin’ money its a foreign language
But uh, shawty can I get wit cha
Fuck it, aye
Do or Die, new arrival
Holla at my niggas
You survive you's alive, yo
Now either you follow me and ride, or you's a rival
The difference between you and I is you a model, you posing
But who am I though?
The mulatto out for that lotto
Money coming soon, the newest model
Your crew is hollow
The type of niggas gobble dick, chew and swallow
Your girl told me shoot in her face, she suicidal
Oh shucks, you niggas is closed, you fold up
I'm from the Ville, niggas get killed over four bucks
Thank God we made it, my niggas, we grown up
Now we crazy over that bread, call us the "dough-nuts" uh
More sluts once the money blows up
But them hoes stop if the dough drops
I won't stop though, a chip off the ole' block
I'm from a city where niggas hold blocks
Leave you looking like old socks, damn
Cops patrol blocks, spotting on us
The boys is rotten, I know they want us
Probably arrest a nigga, get a bonus
You kill a nigga, get promoted
Shit is crazy, girls getting babies before they get diplomas
So much I just go nuts
Niggas telling me slow up
Never that
I'm tryna get where that cheddar at
Y'all don't hear me
Always somebody that don't want you getting cheese, yo
This whole bullshit is like Tom and Jerry
I'm kinda very raw, niggas can't deny facts
If you black they sending you to jail or Iraq
Honor is something you can't sell or buy back
Niggas don't like bragging, they 9-11 fly cats
Hijack niggas, "Get up out your whip nigga, strip!
I want it all- ice on your wrists and the kicks, "
This shit happens, I ain't just rapping, believe it yo
They got streets in the city police won't even go
Peep it though, uh
It ain't no secret, niggas beefing cause my ego so big
It got me speaking like I'm diesel, like I'm devil, oh
Niggas know my style though, I ain't tweaking, I am lethal though
Have your daddy looking for you
This ain't Finding Nemo though
Let me slow it down, dumb it down, y'all warned
The son came up out that womb, yo, a star is born
If real recognize real, y'all are foreign
My team run a play on your bitch and we all scoring, yea!
Lord I've been dreaming about the paper
I want it all
I wanna shine, I wanna ball
I want the whip with the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I've been dreaming about the paper
Man, man I'm on it, I'm on it
Get on my level boy I'm hot like, I've been dancing with the devil man
I'm on it, uh uh I'm on it
So in case you ain't heard, observe
I'm bringing that fire, you know that flame throw
I'm getting you high, I spittin' that brown sugar that DeAnglo
Just look in the sky
A nigga so fly I'm up here touching rainbow's
Ain't making it rain though
No don't be silly mama, I'm no pinata
Letting my paper fall, no way
But if you feeling it, you can take it all and show me
Don't fight the feeling mama
Not Jeffrey Dahmer but your body is a killer mama
I'm tryna rock that ass to sleep like pyjamas
I'ma ball hard with the Roc, crossover hit the shot
My palms itching like I just got the Chicken Pox
Haters wish they could, bitch, I'm bad meaning good
I live my life like you should cause
Get on my level boy I'm hot like I've been dancing with the devil man
And I'm back with that flame, I got that flow that'll blow your brain
They calling me Cole yeah that's my name
And just like Martin I know that pain
No novacaine and won't complain never
But spit it so hot whenever I drop a verse I change weather
Now hey badder I'm dropping that Floyd Mayweather or Lebron James
Rather so much better than these featherweight rappers I'm ahead of my time
And never pressing rewind
Now watch me shine
I'mma ball hard with the Roc, crossover hit the shot
Get on my level I'm hot like, I've been dancing with the devil man
(Watch me shine)
Big plans
Big things
Big money
Big dreams
Big crib
Big screen
I'm tryna shine like
I'm on it, uh uh I'm on it man I'm on it, I'm so on it
Trae tha Truth
Wonder what it's like, how a nigga kill a nigga on sight
Did he hesitate? Think about his life, think about his kids, think about his wife?
But that nigga heartless, group homes, nigga never had no fosters
Cause who taking home the little black kid, poor thing, his momma is a crackhead
So the state raised him, and the hate raised him
They clowned on him at school but he fronted like it ain't phased him
Shit, now it's about getting money cause these cool niggas think his shit is funny
Gotta have clothes, gotta have dough, hoes ain't checking unless you got plenty, now a nigga selling dope
Holding onto a little hope of a better life, huh, but that hope fades so quick
Cause he getting paid so quick
He be robbing niggas just to cop the shit the minimum wage won't get
Young niggas trapped, young niggas strapped, heart turned black, won't turn back
Aye nigga I'm the best man
As if my best friend was getting married
Even with my eyes closed I'm something like a visionary
Paint you a perfect picture, nigga this is pictionary
Man they goin' have to put my picture in the dictionary
Right next to real then put your picture right next to fictionary
Claiming that you trill but you want bitches, all you niggas scary
Don't try to hide from it, oh boy we see you
Claim you goin' ride, oh no we don't believe you
Help wanted, classified, you need more people
Hating mind, I'm greater sign, hey we are no equal
My life is like a movie you like 3 or 4 previews
This the city where they glad to see your soul leave you
You're body laid back like neil so evil
Cole world baby 3 below zero
Getcha life snatched and your vehicle repo
I bring it to you live you gon' see it no TiVo
We on (nigga)
We on (cole world)
We on (cole world nigga)
We on
Look man I'm tryna count money like a CFO you see us ho
Doing shows with hoes speaking languages that we don't know
Look here man, if love is blind then these bitches can't see no mo'
They fucking with the boy like a pedophile
If she won't go then we goin' roll cause J. Cole got a mean old flow
I looked up to some niggas but they ain't fuckin with me no more
Chip on my shoulder like I just left the casino oh
Nigga I been broke so don't hate me cause you don't see no dough
Hip-Hop was like Santa Claus cause no body believed no more
And then I came around, now nigga watch me paint the town
A lil black, a lil brown, a lil white, we a mess
This is Carolina repping you can check-in, be our guest
Me I'm blessed, shout to Khaled while I'm howlin' we da best
All these corny rap niggas tryna be my BFF
Nigga please, go head with that old bullshit you rhymin'
See this that good music, so we ain't got shit in common nigga
What's sunshine with no rain
What's joy without the pain
And I'm still gon' do my thing
There ain't no holding me back
Aye I'mma get mine, believe that
And what's sunshine with no rain
And what's joy without the pain
The city fucked up, even thug niggas getting robbed
Know it's bad when the drug dealers getting jobs
Same niggas who skipped out on graduation
At the gas station
Filling out them applications, but
They ain't calling me back
Best friends be our references
Paychecks spent on necklaces
Downpayments on them lexuses
Debit in the negative
Overdraft, with the sky overcast
But I'm screaming fuck the pessimists
Cause ain't no holding me back
The lil' nigga had big dreams, to do big things
But in this game, everything ain't what this shit seems
Try hard, to climb up to the flag-pole
Just to find out that your heroes is some assholes
But ain't no holding me back
I'mma get mine, believe that
Aye what's sunshine with no rain
Aye what's joy without the pain
Man I'm still gon' do my thang
Too many best-rappers, not enough best-rhymes, though
Guess I'm delusional, used to doing it all the time, so
Maybe I'm just jaded, out of touch and unrelated
Unable to connect greatness based on the person who makes it
Or maybe I just hate it
And that would make me hater
Maybe it is great but that don't mean it's greater
Having your profile raised doesn't make you a raiser
Being ambiguous with assertions, isn't making you safer
What you mean, though?
Line us up, paddling us on the back
Like we steamboat, you president of the frat
You goin' sling toast, like you Ringo
And you think Doc Holliday's
Just goin' tolerate and too sick to let that thing go
It's just a matter of returns
Ashes to ashes, scattered them from the urns
To start a fire shaky to gather them from the burned
And reassemble these ashes, the blackness is something firm
Then moving blackness backwards in the bread of some other shit
Any deep we spreadin' wheat seeds from a bucket shit
McDonald had a farm and he lovin' it
Rolls Royce of the scented voice against the arms of the government
Artists gettin' robbed for their publishing
By dirty Jewish execs that think his alms from the covenant
I'll retire when I'm tired, that's a Firestone death
Easy to say when nobody's there, like a microphone check
They wanna hear what I'm gon' say before the microphone check
Make me sign an NDA before the microphone test
'Less you face that type of faith, institutional opposition
Then with all due respect, you are not my competition
Nah
Disappear (ghost)
But a dollar and a dream and a model for the team
Or a slogan for the soul
How you living your just another soldier right?
What I'm fighting for don't even know what I'm writing for
Man this ain't even real life no more
I'm on the edge and I got nothing but a song
I'm lucky if the birds sing along
Just to make it in this broadway lights
Now I'm shinin in the broad, day-light - go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got a glow like a lil' Lightsaber
So, clap for him, then applaud Hov
He gave 'em the platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir
The flow cold as a shoulder of a gold diggin hoes
When a broke nigga 'proaches
Told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muh'fuckers soak it in
Clap for him
Is it the girls, or the money or is there more?
I know the world ’bout to come to an endin’
So, before it does, let me finish all my sinnin’
I see the devil grinning, as if he winning
This just the bottom of the 9th inning
I’m coming back like light-skin and
What a sad sight, lookin’ at my gas light
Damn, man, I just threw ten in
Look, 5 dollars won’t get you what it used to
And, look, love don’t mean what it used to
And everybody and they momma on YouTube
Is it just me or is this unusual?
Don’t wanna lose you, just wanna reach y’all
So let me slow down to the beat y’all
Put the remote down, move ya feet y’all
One time for the boys holdin’ heat y’all
Keep that tucked ‘fore somebody get hurt
See me, I’d rather cut let ya body give birth
Now, if you was the last man walking on Earth
Turn this up, clap ya hands like this was church
Hey…and clap for him…
Yeah, Cole world out in the UK
Aww yeah
Impossible, impossible
How many niggas done jocked the flow
Young boy from Fayettenam, how you gon’ tell me not to go?
The south of France we out in Cannes and I ain’t never been on no yacht before
I took the bitch, she went with me, we literally just rocked the boat
Nigga, lock the vault, sewn up, young Simba, grown up
Told y’all I was growing up, now I’m on ya’ll I’ma load up
You was hatin’ me, cops waiting patiently for me to fall gracefully
Know a couple ya’ll couldn’t wait to see
You bitch niggas better own up
Phenomenal, tired of acting like y’all don’t know
Hoes fallin’ like domino
She ain’t fucking she gotta go
Am I wrong cause I got some dough and copped a couple finer things
G-Shock to Rolex, my, how the times have changed!
Life’s better now, might spend a thou’ for a bright sweater
Tell ‘em my price went up now
Had the right set up, ain’t no way I might let up now
Do you know how ill it feel to make a dyke get aroused
Nigga
Got a young chick from the hood, south side
Little did he know the shit was going to back fire
‘Cause she act quiet, got baptized, sang in the choir
But the thing she desired was a
Older nigga show her how to be a freak
The young girl is in heat, it’s deep
She living on her own and it’s vicious out
And I’m thinking of the best way to kick her out
‘Cause all she ever talks about is Louie, Louie
All she ever talks about is Louis Vuitton
And nigga, I can’t fuck with her no more
I mean Louie, Louie, all she ever talk about is Louie, Louie
She talking ‘bout “me too”
LA on my next flight, you guess right, she said “me too”
Now everybody gonna Ms. Me Too
You on a boat that won’t travel
Won’t float and won’t paddle
If I go broke it won’t matter
This stupid ass shit don’t make me
I been poor, won’t break me
You so caught up on material shit
We both know that you can’t even get
I mean my window down
Let me roll my windows up
My plink went down
I just got my little cup
My freaks go down
Nigga I can’t fuck with her no more
Ayo, ayo…
Dude got a rich bitch, though
She off the chain, ready to go
Baddest thing, head to toe
Fine line between a rock star and just a ho
But she walked that
Goddamn, girl, she walked that
Big money talk real loud
I mean I can barely talk back
But I, but I got good game, good game
Nothing like them lames you used to
I know the rules gon’ use you
I just want the same shit that you do
Can you keep a secret?
Sometimes, man, your beeper leak it
Nigga told me she evil
I danced with the devil then, please believe it
Please believe it
She take my hip-hop, ayo
She don’t want to fuck with me
Am I big snob? Ayo
She might not fuck with me
Am I a big splotch? Ayo
She don’t want to fuck with me no more
Bustin, I'm going off
Sting like a bee, float like it's Noah's ark
You know it's hard, flow is sharp
Like I'm blowing darts
Niggas bear with me
These hoes out here looking like some spare kidneys
They give it up, how gracious, ass outrageous
Up in the club you could spot her, a Dalmatian
Said she found God, but to me she found Satan
She only getting hotter
What's good with the Ramada Inn?
Got a game tighter than them jeans her ass hiding in
I got that D baby, ain't talking vitamins
She said: "That's cool nigga
But can you buy the Benz? "
She playin’ niggas like a violin
I hit that ass just a little more violent
She hitting notes, then I'm ghost like it's Shaolin
I'm on the prowl maybe soon I'll throw the towel in
Until that day's found
This is my playground
This is a playground
But if shit got hard, would you stay down
Would you stand up for me, would lay down
Or would you 'scape town on the first Greyhound
Hey now, hey, this is a playground
Would you stand up for me, would you lay down
Hey now, hey this is a playground
This is a playground, merry-go-round
Like a dream for a nigga
But I swing on a nigga if he push me
I'm makin' moves like the Rutgers
These ain't no monkey bars motherfucker, not a sucker
But these labels throw me deals like the prosecution
Want to underpay me and fuck me like its prostitution
I write that constitution, you know, that classic shit
How you going to own my masters
And you ain't mastered shit?
Give them my ass to kiss, my lawyer laughed at this
Said they was on some bullshit when they drafted this
Like MJ, so I wagged a finger like Dikembe
Until you niggas talking proper paper, no comprende
And now the deals got mills like Wendy's
And got these labels doing bids like inmates
Hoping my pen lays my name down
Until that day's found, this is my playground
Runnin' from cops, for hundreds of blocks
Like Short Dawg before he stumbled
And dropped
Gun in my crotch and its unloaded
I just toat it for fun hoping that one day
They catch me on camera like Gunplay
Gunbutting motherfuckers that's one way
To sell a album
Need all the help I can get
Cause on this shelf that I sit, its real lonely
My fans do they still want me?
They waitin', I am fightin' satan
He think I am his lil homie
These stories are metaphors
They hold a deeper message for those who fed up
Hoping you had my life instead of yours
They say the grass is always greener
The pussy's always cleaner on the other side
Until you mow the lawn with gonorrhea
And you realize you had it better
Way before the cheddar came
Looking back I wanted your respect and never fame
But you know the saying right Jermaine
Careful what you ask for
Cause even when you was mad poor
At least laughed more
Never thought I'd still be proving myself on my sophomore
I understand its been a year and a half since my last tour
But things have changed since I last seen the ring
But the one who seem to claim that he the king got a glass jaw
And I'mma break this shit
Cole World no handkerchief
Two classics and I am Kobe Bryant on some Laker shit
Fighting to make the playoffs
Writing and taking no day offs
I'm on fire like money hungry company lay offs
No pink slips if loose lips sink ships
Then God dammit ahhhh fuck these niggas Titanics
I am joking, only provoking
In hopes to go number one again
Hoping some rappers disses me just to make this shit fun again
It's no fair
Pac had Mobb Deep and Biggie
And I get left with is Tyrese and Diggy
This is bullshit
Gotta get my groove back, you know?
It's been a little minute
This is for my niggas tryna make it
Watch out for them evil ass niggas tryna take it, uh
They love to see a nigga dead, up in jail
Living in a world where we set up to fail
But I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna to get it (Uh)
I'ma get it, nigga, I'm finna to get it (Yeah)
I'ma get it, nigga, I'm gotta get it
Tell 'em Geppettos my niggas in ghettos with Scarface dreams
On the block with the hard hate, that's all they seen
Niggas killing niggas in broad day on all they screens
Watching cops loving car chase scenes
Niggas arrested
Treat us like roaches, the prison's nigga infested
They hate to see the day we ain't slain, niggas invested
All created equal looks like equal to a less than
Depending on your race, or depending on your address, man
I've been blessed, was given less and but still progress, man
I hate to see the position my niggas left in
Sling dope or nigga you slave for minimum wage
Ashamed
But we living in the cage, so nigga get paid, shit
How could I tell a nigga not to hustle?
Yeah, it's a better life my nigga, but it's not for us though
Instead they wanted us to break, they never wanted us to make it (Yeah)
To my niggas: smarten up until we smart enough to take it, nigga
Girl get your head right, you best get your head right
You make sure my home good, I make sure your neck bright
You text me you wanna be next to me
I book you the ticket right next to me
Girl, you could pick up this check with (flex)
Uh, uh-huh
I'm I-95 cruising, the sun in my eyes
Headed south, dog, my mom ain't seen her son in awhile
Yea, I'll sure is
Can't wait to see my niggas and fuck with my old chicks
Can't wait to cruise the city, be catching them old grins
Same niggas, same place, doing the same old shit
Yea, so nigga watch it!
A nigga been in NY tryna get some bigger pockets
You still up in the ville, tryna make it in the trap
I'm finna put us on the map; I told you I was coming back, Cuz
Yeah, so make way, the prince of the city, ain't a street I can't stay
You niggas is hatin,' just be happy I ain't changed
Blunts rolled to the murk, we all want the same thing
And that's- money to feed us, yup
We pray to God, but, we ain't tryna meet Him yet, haha!
Yea, If I never..
Nigga, man
Actually that is a bad idea, my nigga
'Cause, uh
Nah nah nah
Now I'ma always come home
Its where a nigga was grown
Where a nigga was shown
How to scrap, yup
Shown how to mack, yup
Where my niggas sold a whole lot of crack, yup
Juggling them hoes
There was a whole lot of that, yup
Momma work to the bone, puttin' clothes on my back
I'm comin' home to give everything I owe to her back, yea
Yeah, I swear they say, man
Shout to the whole ville!
Of course, so real!
Uh, If I never- if I never went home again
"Hello? Chill out nigga, what's up, boy?
Yeah, I just touched down man
I'm over off Ramsey and shit
Aiight, well look
I'm about to go check out my mom's man
What's jumping for tonight?
Oh the Live? I'm in there, nigga
Fast lane, looking bad thang with them brains
From the passenger side of the ride while I drive
And I swerve, vision blurred, make it hard to observe
Blame the liquor I absorb and plus I’m high as God
Why is it Lord that I can’t seem to slow the whip down?
The same boy standing up when them teachers told him sit down
Look now, I done growed up and still don’t follow rules
Carter blues, nigga hold up, y’all still don’t got a clue
Yeah, all the cool niggas from high school that still ain’t doing shit
‘Member when y’all used to fuck niggas till they blue and shit?
Now your ass broke as a joke and them niggas doing it
Funny how the tables turned and life, nigga, you ruined it
Three kids that never see they daddy ‘less he need a dollar from his baby mama
And y’all still don’t wear a condom, is you stupid nigga?
Falling in love with these hoes, is you Cupid nigga?
You better learn ‘fore you burn boy, see me stay on top of my game, David Stern boy
Did this dirt like worms, now my mom was more concerned with the future
Y’all niggas stuck in neutral, this a city where police tryna shoot ya
The army tryna recruit ya, I’m here to get ya higher baby so this here the booster
I’m tryna be the king, this that Martin Luther
Shit is crucial, now let me introduce ya to the real
From the ‘Ville, still pourin' liquor ‘fore my niggas killed
Busting, I'm going off, sting like a bee, float like it's Noah's ark
You know it's hard, flow is sharp like I'm blowing darts
Niggas bear with me, these hoes out here looking like some spare kidneys
Up in the club, you could spot her, a Dalmatian
Said she found God but to me, she found Satan
She only getting hotter, what's good with the Ramada Inn?
She said “That's cool nigga but can you buy the Benz?”
She playing niggas like a violin, I hit that ass just a little more violent
Until that day’s found, this is my playground
What do I gotta do to prove to you I’m not the dude for you to just try to fool with?
Niggas ain’t got a clue bitch, niggas wanna bullshit
Don’t know that my crew thicker than these cute bitches, we normally knocking boots with
Too slick to grip, my nigga should stop that
That verse was so old that I done forgot that
But now I come off the top with the hot raps
Niggas know you better stop that
Coming through, got the Glock cocked back
Nigga I ain’t even got one
Nigga, I’m aiming at your face with the shotgun
Lyrically, spiritually
Niggas tryna mirror me but I’m vampire and I’m so damn higher than the average nigga
Can you get witcha ya? I just signed with Jigga, nigga how high you figure?
Damn, I’m slipping up on my words but my verbs so sick that I never slip
Niggas know uh-uh, please save me XV
Yea, lost in the world
Like Siddhartha while I author these quotes
Cutting hoes like a varsity coach
Caught fire, no larceny
Please you gotta pardon these boasts
A lot of niggas pray to God that he choke
Never see the album drop
Fall off and be broke
Reminiscing on the hard times
So often he'd hope
To slip his foot in the door
Promise when I made it
I'd write my hooks for the poor
But now I'm hella faded
And got my foot to the floor
While I'm pushing this Porsche
Seem to be more concerned with how I look in the Source
Staring in the mirror just to see a look of remorse
Take a look at my chain
Look at what I became, mayne
Yea, that old me that you knew well is still in me
Somewhere, deep down there
Hiding in the corner is a nigga who cared
Believed he could change the world and he dared
Now he sits alone
Used to write poems but that's gone
It's been so long cause he's scared
The world ain't fair and I'm fully aware
When the revolution comes will I stare
Or will I ride
Lost in the world like Siddhartha while I author these quotes
Caught fire no Larceny, please you gotta pardon these boasts
A lot of niggas pray to god that he choke
Never see the album drop Fall off and be broke
Reminiscing on the hard times, so often he'd hoped to slip his foot in the door
Promise when I made it I’d write my hooks for the poor
But now I'm hella Faded and got my foot to the floor while I'm pushing this Porsche
Take a look at my chain, look at what I've became! (Man)
You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to say so
I say this' my song for you, my friend
And you can only see that I
Can hardly let things go, no oh yeah
So listen to the sound of my voice
Your brothers sending all my love
Is giving me no choice no no no
Listen to the sound of the point, ha!
Ragamuffin is a freedom fighter
He's handeling a choice and I know, that
Dear ragamuffin is one of the friend
What you see is what you really get in the end
What you ever gonna gonna do I dunno
Dear ragamuffin shall not fall down
Cause he has the wisdom of a not fool around
What is a good sense under ya ground yes
Dear ragamuffin is one of the band
What is a good sense under ya ground yeah
Yeah, that old me that you knew well is still in me
Somewhere deep down there
Believed he could change the world, and he did
Now he sits alone, used to write poems
But that's gone it's been so long cause he's scared
The world ain't fair, and I'm fully aware
When the revolution comes will I stare, or will I ride
Dear ragamuffin is one of the band (ride)
What you see is what you really need in the end (ride)
What you ever gonna gonna do I dunno (ride)
(ride, ride, ride, ride)
Dear ragamuffin shall not fall down (ride)
Cause he has the wisdom of a not fool around (ride)
What is a good sense under ya ground yeah (ride)
No, no, no, yeah
One time for the plan
Straight to the top, I got the power in my hands
Live for the moment, be hot
Act like you want it, reach high
Now we ain't known, but we try
Now holla back and reply
Feel like I lived for this moment
I see it in their eyes, them other guys don't want it
My style they can crown it, but can't dethrone it
I was aiming for the top and now I I I'm on it
What a powerful performance
I was in my zone, send flowers for opponents
Tell 'em "Get well soon"
Cause I ain't in the mood
So if you read that word backwards then it should spell 'doom'
I'm on fire, y'all can inhale fumes, as I zoom by ya
As you thinking, 'Who's higher?'
Fueled by a desire you should admire
That's why I'm what they aspire to be 'fore they retire
A livin' legend, with God givin' blessings
And game so cold they probably watching this in Heaven
Expecting the incredible, so baby watch me do that
And make the Angels say 'Lord, how he do that?'
A champion's mentality
And so I'm scoring, ignoring the fact you're fouling me
And one, where I go you can't come
I was schooling your father boy, that make you my grandson
I've been around the block twice, now my shot nice
No referee but best believe out here I got stripes
Now that they finally consider me a legit scorer
Would you believe I started off as a bench-warmer?
Have me feelin' like Master Splinter
Now the haters and commentators say 'there's a winner'
Hey, hard work pay off, now I don't take a day off
I rest not, I guess that's why your best shot? Way off
These are the things that dreams are made of
The sweep, no time for sleep, when you're elite
If what you reap is what you sow, then what was you expecting?
Expect to come in second
While I become a legend
Why don't you reach for the sky?
You don't believe you can fly?
I guess I'll see you when you get here
And they say that’s flattering but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y’all need to practice that more
See my man Nate, ask me if I gained weight, I said nah
My pockets got fatter, that’s all
Money was an issue but now that that’s solved, I ball, I ball
Like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantel
Dawg my shows be off the handle
Take the proceeds, go to gamble, ha
Bet it all black, and pray I quadruple my salary
If I win maybe then I can pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealing with some real life shit
She be asking when, bitch, when I feel like it
Cole World, Cole life, Cole blooded
I be on my shit and look at all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club staring at me
How that feel? Very happy (very happy)
Cole World, Boy, check the degree’s
These lil niggas is trash go and get the Febreeze
That’s why I blew up on you sucka’s all thats left is debris
One soldier’s all that’s left is fatigues
Act like you know me boy, I’m Kobe
How the fuck you gon step in my league
Rapping bout bullshit, your message fatigue
Played out, phoney nigga probably only got arrested for weed
And out here talking that dime shit
Dom Perignon shit
Not gon cut it like some scissors on my lawn shit
Grown cause I own shit
This is what you won’t get
Game so cold, bring the blizzard to the Palms
I’m a wizard, I’m a don and I put this on my mom
I’m offended, I’m appalled
If y’all ain’t bowing
Claim you a monster but y’all ain't growling
Claim you a beast, why y’all ain't howling?
‘Bout as sweet as a jumper on the gay Ray Allen
I’m ’bout fucking hoes like Ray J wylin’
Killin’ niggas like K K K violence
I guess it’s why they pay homage
Momma I’mma be BIG and I put that on the late great Wallace
Christopher, check my temperature, nigga my integers..
Whatever man
Been f-cked the world but she just now cummin’
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin’
I ain't never been the one for fourth down puntin’
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I’m crown huntin’
So I lock pick just to lock shit back
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac
Yet, I’m a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Ballin’ like a Laker you should pray for next year
Cause I’m repeating and I’m 3-peatin’
And I’m knee deep in the game its quick sand and I keep leakin’
The label heat seekin’, nigga ain't sign me, what the fuck was he thinkin’
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season
Man these niggas get exlusives
Man, I’m already hot, you can say I’m pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling your’s “be seated”
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it
Email the shit make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don’t wanna believe it
I be in the airport damn near bare foot
Security hollin’ out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I don’t even be weeded
No point drinkin’ I can’t even be faded
Real recognize real like they related
Fuckin’ bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just happy he made it
My money was running late now, now it’s happy belated
I’m heavy, nigga I’m heavy
"You gotta do what your heart tells you to do. Let me tell you something' right now. You're only allowed three great women in your lifetime. They come along like the great fighters, once every ten years. Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, Joe Louis. Sometimes you get 'em all at once. Me? I had my three when I was 16. That happens. What are you gonna do? That's the way it goes, you know? Tell you right now. See this girl? Maybe this girl, she put wind in your sails. Maybe she's your first great one..."
You got your feelings hurt?
You wanna talk about it?
Guess what bitch, I don't wanna hear about it
I do my thing and I don't care how you feel about it
Well,  it's that yap talk, pistol holdin' nigga on your damn street
Pussy  nigga usually pop a trigger if the hand speak
Lackluster, I'm a smack suckers
You know better, you know better
We should go and make a baby
You been patient, you deserve me on the daily
You ain't really with the beggin'
You know better than be talkin' to me crazy
'Cause you know this, yeah you know this
I ain't one for being bogus
Got this weight up on my shoulders
Girl you treat me like a bogey
I've been stressed out, keep me stress free
You've been waitin' for me so long
Couple days I had to prolong, hold on, hold on
You niggas gotta be outta your rabbit ass mind
A savage over this cabbage
You really think I'm finna let your faggot ass shine? (No)
Whipping niggas like big body Cadillacs
I'm on my grind, yo, bonafide honcho
I could see through you niggas with cataracts, blindfolds
Matter of fact, I'm so bomb, niggas scatter that
Niggas that, Niggas so rat, Niggas better act pronto
My whole state in a reign, better pack ponchos, y'all know
Shit is real in the ville, you could die slow or quick
Survival's a bitch
But everybody don't meet her, so tuck the nine yo
Wherever y'all roll, niggas allergic to 5-0
God knows I don't put up no facade, no
No fraud, niggas scheming like Sideshow Bob
Keep my eyes so wide, nothing otherwise
Disrespect me, you could watch your mother sigh
From the other side, punk-ass nigga
Jump and get lumped fast, throw you in the trunk
Blast pop while I pump gas
Skunk ass niggas is trash, you need a sponge bath
My niggas will ride all day like a fun pass
That's some New York shit, I'm from the south, though
Don't never disrespect me out yo mouth, ho
I got major clout though, y'all niggas dissin' me is doubtful
You talk shit? Watch your life fade like the outro
A verse from me is like 11 birds
I did the math, it’s like two thousand dollars every word
Top, top top, top of the world!
Uh!
I'm on top of the world (Yeah) and I can't get no higher (Uh uh)
And if I fall, waitin' on me it's a fire (Yeah)
But in the meantime I get whatever I desire (So)
So if I told you that I'd stop, I'd be a liar (Ok)
And nah, I ain't worried 'bout the things I do (Uh uh)
It might be more than a plane's eye view
But uh (but uh), ma I'm on top of the world (Uh uh)
I'm on top of the world
First off, uh, rest in peace Track Willie
Ridin' with me cus, back then nobody pulled for me (Whoo!)
Now I sit back reclined and shine it's all fine
Cus the flow merit status was before my time
I remember daydreamin' when I bust like the semen
Of a heater, said the truth and nobody believed him (Uh uh)
Now the story's fabricated, the public is elated
That somebody from the west considered the next greatest (Who's next)
The Prince (haha), and don't get it twisted (Uh huh)
I spit from the soul but the steez is just gifted
I lived it, talked about him (yeah), ridin' now, we'll walk about it (yeah)
Death of Cornballs like chalk, put the line around it (Haha)
On some D.O.A. shit
No gangsta reality's as real as it gets (Fo' real)
I remember writin' rhymes in the halfway house (Uh huh)
Now I'm sittin' at the top, there's somethin' to talk about
These words go together like a verbal collage
It's murder how the words'll collide
And bring you further from where murderers lie
And maybe you could see a mill, no not no burgers or fries
But give you food for thought, my nigga this is Gerber with rhymes
Servin' up lines for your child like mine, nigga this live
So you think you seen a style like mine, it's a mirage
But I, I'll be obliged like Mary J
Then show you how to strive, when it die like everyday
And nigga stay in court like Perry Mason or Gary Payton
New shoes up on his feet like every week, his mom's interogatin'
Like where you been? Who you been with?
Scared he runnin the streets with them freak and them nitwits
Look up in his face, she see the fatherly resemblence
Read him more than a book
Scared he inherited way more than just looks
But uh, mama I'm on top of the world
Uh! I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world!
Cole World, young Simba, story of my life
How to shine, put glory over ice
Rules made to be broken like a Oreo in life
Unabomber, they thought I blew up overnight (Boom)
UPS, plus it down, huh, while you BS'd and fucked around
I took a dollar to the city of the dreams
Called up my homies and then I put them on my team
And so we paid, and now we out in London, oh, behave
Cold World if you wonderin', snowy days
I made it through with no heaters, fuck the leaders
When we starvin' they won't feed us, we don't need 'em
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the story of a young man who left everyone and everything he loved to chase his dream. A lil' nigga from North Carolina, Fayetnam to be exact. Packed up all his shit and moved to the big city of dreams, where he ain't know a motherfuckin' soul, and he ain't have a motherfuckin' thing, just a dollar and a dream.
This mixtape is provided partly in part by, Dreamville Records. Straight out the Ville where anything's possible. All-terrain music, that's Carolina's finest boy. And by any means, when ain't shit handed to you, you gotta take it. Without further ado ladies and gentlemen I proudly present to you, J. Cole, The Come Up.
Below that Mason Dixon my residence
Dirty South Confederate
Ay we should hold election's I say Bun B for President
He represent them Real Niggas
TX to ATL to NC yea them Ville Niggas
Them Trill niggas chill nigga this that rider shit
My bottom bitch say "I'm not a bitch boy I got a bitch"
I keep her ass in Prada shit
These rappers counterfeit
I potty train niggas yea this that "teach you how to" shit
I'm 'bout to shit my minds the Glock my mouth's the clip
My words is bullets I'm 'bout to spit
I'll leave you leakin you lay in pieces
As if the streets a couch and shit
You see me on my bouncin shit
Watch how I put you out this shit
Man I'm makin so much money gotta pay somebody to count this shit
Probably gonna make my accountant sick
Boy I'm higher than a mountain's get
These new niggas ain't talkin bout nothin
Cause it's obvious they ain't been around this shit
So they bound to split
When they go down, profound with these pronouns
Ladies lovin J. Cole now
So you better not bring yo ho round
You know the residence
Them Trill niggas
Ten times removed, I forget about where it all began
Yeah, no Zack and Kelly but tell me and to The Max we go
And treat these verses like Margarito and Pacquiao
Teachers thought I’d never come out my shell and well
Now I hop on beats and go pistachio
They’ll never steal my dreams like Leo DiCaprio
So before the madness grow, I speak what they have to know
In a town that was small, I crashed in the lawn
The effect that I met was like a splash in the pond
See I, rap for my mom in the back of the car she said
Boy, you crazy, Momma’s little baby
I always told her I would drop a project one day
Now I’m takin' off, my project's on the runway
From suburbs of young nerds to projects that see gun play
To models on the runway, it’ll reach ‘em all in some way
They hit my brother with ten years, he said don’t leave
I said, there’s no weave baby brother I’ve been here
So this is my beginning
I look to the sky, with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky, is the limit
But I don’t know why, and when I finally fly
I'm gonna show em all, this is my beginning
I look to the sky with a cape on my back
And they tell me the sky is the limit
But I don’t know why, but I don’t know why
July baby but cooler than an October boy
With more lines than a zebra wearin' corduroys
On my high horse, I should go to Troy
Set my flight course, as my wings deploy
Postcards and Polaroids
But not enough time to buy a stamp and show my boys
In Japan eatin' fish that's coy with little soy
Then I’m off to London watchin' this bridge that we built destroy
Don’t take advantage of the simple joys
My Ma text all the time but I miss her voice
And I know you wish you caught me before I flew off
But I was runnin' red lights like Rudolph
Just so I can zoom off, like takin' Nike shoes off
Hit the stage that I grace to amuse y’all
Wanna be a pilot, you gotta learn to fly
And you wanna be a star, your home in the sky
That's why
Look, my RCA blast and some jewels that I cut like Cartier
Soon as I stepped outta the chamber like the RZA
Bobbin' to my Digital shit
Plan to lash at all the haters with this physical whip
My lyrics flow like, how much more can lyrical get
When all I try to do is put they soul on spiritual lift
The pastor tell it, I’m abusin' my miracle gift
When I just do like him and use it just to get me some chips
So if the rappin' this male do, just happen to help you
And fell through the cracks, and it happen to fit
Watch it connect your soul, my hustle like Russell
I just hope my grind connects with the globe
And then bring some more label reps to my home
Then I can pass the cake to the next nigga on
Fly maneuvers, Metropolis is on
I say bye to, but I will never be gone
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil For real, you the only father that I ever knew I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville Talk to a nigga
One time for my L.A. sisters One time for my L.A. hoes Lame niggas can't tell the difference One time for a nigga who know
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna
Be saved
No role models and I'm here right now No role models to speak of Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up And tell her, "Hey, what's good?" "Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it." But then I thought back, back
To a better me Before I was a B-list celebrity Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody You wasn't sweatin' me
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows— —out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do' Nigga, you know how it go She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird
Trap
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)
Fool me one time, shame on you Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow) She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow) She shallow but the pussy deep (she
Shallow, she shallow) She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
Be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved Don't save her, she
Don't wanna be saved
This is just my check in on a mission tryna find myself
Vexed missing blessings
Tryna find my Wealth
The best
Always dressed
In nothing less than
What's comfortable
Excuse my diction
I been bumping Nas
For a month or two
Watching all the things in this world
That's supposed to be a part of me
Got me ready to make my own Carter Three
See this shit is a part of me
So pardon me
I had to part
My opposition
Had to get my own pot to piss in
Had to make my own bread
Build my own business
I had to make it past chilling in the hood business
Seeing my dad really put me in a different state
Fuck what I been running for
I'm lost in another race
The one for my soul
The one against my demons
The one I drink away
The one that keeps me scheming
Late at night to be a star
You know I call it dreaming
It's not about the fame I mean that
I really mean it
But let me tell you the truth
And why I do this here's the reason
I promise you it's not no corny shit
I'm really speaking
I wanna save lives first and foremost
Cuz I remember Chance The Rapper saving me from jumping outta dorm rooms
But I also need money
Cuz my family ain't got it
And see I got a talent
That could fill up mom's wallet
So for me to not get paid
Is literally me wilding
You gotta understand
My life won't be like yours without it
And I cannot just chill
And wait to perish at the bottom
So you gon have to hear me
Make my way thru all my problems
Cuz Nigga I am legend
Fresh Prince but I ain't rich
I'm a dog
Kinda small
But ain't never been bitch
Problem 1
Nigga, I was broke last year
I couldn't afford shit
Almost sold dope last year
Just weed
You know in case I make it with this dream
This next one in line
Behind balling in the league
See I cannot fail
Because my pockets so frail
Worst part of my day
Was putting up with Auntie yells
Then Nic called
You know that's my big dawg
He said we gotta hit New York
You a big fish don't get small
So he took some dollars
He coulda gave to his daughter
And put em on a nigga that he knew would take this farther
I was scared as fuck
I even fainted on the plane
Cuz I knew this was it
I'd never see the bay the same
We
Got up in them offices
Gave em a good listen
Told em' I could see the future of the game
I got a vision
I can change the whole thang
Like when Jordan met Pippen
I know you see the same
Nodding yo head while you listen
I know that I got a thing for being the best out
Respected like D-Rose
Savvy like Steve Stoute
Dipping on these hoes
Blowing my weed out
Fixing my Yankee cap
Rewriting my daily raps
I swear I'm the cleanest out
Cole I need a beat
Like you need a damn haircut
Got some bars
You wouldn't dare touch
See at least you fucking with me now
I was scared first
I didn't wanna let you down
Peace to who wears the crown
Look around
Now I swear It's different in the world for guys like us
Not just emcees
Niggas who really say real stuff
Including Lil Uzi, 21, Kodak, Tee Grizz, Lil Yachty, Denzel Curry, Migos, Rae Sremm, Rich Homie, and of course my nigga Thug
All my dawgs painting what our childhoods was
You get no love
If you hating
On a young man
Stacking up his chips
Like he finna go all in
The system want us missing
I can see they hate the vision
I'm done tryna play the game for niggas that's just sitting
I'm done tryna be the guy
That's getting all the bitches
I just wanna touch the sky
And bring you all there to witness
So let me spread my wings
Aye let me spread my wings
It's therapist
The golden child
Peep what I'm saying
Yo, yo, check it, yo
Yeah you cats is fly but your plane is crashing
You came and passed
My range blasting
I came slashing
Same fashion
That OJ stabbed him
My brain's packed with more lines than caine addicts
These insane raps should stay wrapped in a Straitjacket
You featherweight class bitch
Don't want mine
That's why your whole squad is telling me
"Pick on someone your own size"
I got the whole nine
Ain't perfect but I'm border lining
My album come with a surgeon general's warning on it (Sick)
I spit a born vomit
The hot shit
Even when I die shit
I'll still be the livest
Quit with the nonsense
You hating but you feeling it though
Stepped on stage
Got arrested for stealing the show
Stealing the zone
Never left it
Niggas never contested
On a five star scale you get one less then Texas (Get it)
I got narcoleptics
Why the whote now
When this shit goes down
Niggas barely show up when I show down
I hold ground
Go more rounds than carrousels
And you beating me only happens in fairy tales
You dreaming
My pieces is so dope you feinding
That Cole flow you sink
When I dive off the deep end
I'm head hunting
Heads front
But ain't said nothing
So heads up or spill red blood cause your head is gushing
Bitch what
No STD's
But still a sick fuck
You blast from point blank range and never hit once
I'm heaven sent
From devilish
To Specialist
You niggas couldn't make a good impression of what cements
So throw up the white flag
No need to fight back
Drop your mic
Head to the freezer
And grab the knife pack
Get your lights snatched
I'm cold as the ice cap
Sold my soul to satan
Turned around and stole it right back
I'm jacking dead broke folks cause I'm dirt poorer
I tried to ball but fouled out in the first quarter
Flagrant rhymes
The facts that you proclaiming
They aiming the same phrase as mine
Taking the same frame of mind
I'm out to shine on any track that I'm hopping on
Changing album names
The false alarm
It's not the bomb
The style is off the wall
Kick shit like Bandhan
Therapist is the man
Hands down like a handstand
With a grand flow and my heart had to follow
I'm so ahead of my time I wrote this rhyme tomorrow, what
Whoever thought a Carolina nigga would've been the greatest
We strong cause the hard times made us into men
Hold up I gotta say that shit again
I said the hard times made us into men
See a man gonna stand with the world as a weight
But the boy gonna break, only so much he could take
See I traveled outta state and I ain't know a soul
Told my momma I'd be back when I had a million sold
Million flows million stories I done told
Shed tears when they cut me from the team couldn't wait till next year
Then I told the best player look
"Though I ain't as tall as y'all niggas
Next year I'mma be better then all ya'll niggas"
Ay this is for the Ville shout to all ya'll niggas
I pray you never pass like them ballhog niggas
And at all cost nigga I'mma shine
They gon' remember my name like it's tatted on they mind
J. Cole J. Cole
Ay, fresher than a day old newborn, bitches blowing kisses
That's the same ho that you on
I knew her back in high-school, but heard she failed college
She blew me like she blew her nail polish
That's knowledge if I ever seen it
Say I'mma call her, but don't ever mean it
See I'm preoccupied, watch how my stock arise
She want the time and that's just something I cannot provide
Cause time is money and I, I ain't no dummy and I
I'm trying get paid, man I gotta stay brave Atlanta
I let your misses sip me, I ain't talking David Banner, ain't a planner
So if it's random then it's naturally
Name a motherfucker out here matching me
Nigga I'm feeling good, nigga I'm feeling good
Nigga I'm feeling good
Let me tell you a little story about my homie Corey
Right now he's locked down serving at least forty
But excuse me, I got ahead of myself, I'm sorry son
This story starts in his youth, he was hardly one
When his pops got knocked for coping rocks
From under cover cops on the corner of his block
And he never got a chance to meet him
Cause the very next year his pops is laying still in the prison cell bleeding from stab wounds, fatal
Bad news Corey's mother and older brother already caught in the struggle
Brother barely ate tryna hustle just to carry weight
The whole family underweight cause they rarely ate
One thing my nigga never got was love
And his whole childhood he was watching drug addicts
His brother supplying it, old mother buying it
You expect a scientist to come from this environment
Get real!, this shits hard enough brought up black
But being poor plus your mums on crack
And your brothers a hustler tryna take you under his wing shit, just a fucking wonder his breathing
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you I'll make a difference
I promise you ill make a difference
Age five, Corey had dreams to be a cop, but
Age six, his older brother passed the Glock, let him hold it
Plans change, he started his campaign
Age thirteen, little boy doing big man things
And that's what he thought
He was jacking rims from mustangs
Beating down on his class mates for chump change
Running round with the tough gang
The older niggas he sold dope for 'em, they bought clothes for him
However, soon he got older and selling petty dimes turned into some pretty heavy crimes
The shit got to the point where he was stealing rides from his block
Even robbing quick stops
Ladies loved him, he was crazy fucking
Knocking boos daily, pretty soon he had a baby coming
But he didn't claim it, his baby mother was crazy loving him
She said "Baby, let's settle down," he left her hanging
He'd rather be on the streets slanging a wild cat
But god damn i seen it coming a mile back
A drug deal gone bad guns bursting
Now Corey lying in a cell cause he merked him
Whats the moral of the story?, figure it out
So the next time you ask why niggas are wild
You know with out a doubt, don't try and deny the shit
Young black male, a product of his environment
Cause i can't stand to see my people struggling
But what we up against? tough conditions in this life
And they wonder why these niggas all get hype, get high and fist fight
Or why they live like they living, to get ice and cars
No type of jobs, income coming from dicing and robbing niggas in broad daylight
Its hard cause all they know in this life is scars
This mic is all i need to change the globe, re-arrange it and make it so
Niggas ain't in pain no more
Cause they they don't pay no more mind to all youth
Till they got to locking them up and dawg that's the truth yo
Thats the truth yo, that's the truth
There's gold at stake for Golden State
How much weight can King's shoulders take
When the odds ain't great some fold and break
While greats let the dreams of a ring motivate
Boys become men when postseasons begin
These lights shine brighter baby, sink or you swim
To those who got here by the skin of they teeth
The formula's the same now: win and repeat
Never sleep on a man that's expected to lose
With a chip on his shoulder and something to prove
The bottom's full of Wolves and they thirsty for blood
The mission is to catch somebody slipping above
"But numbers don't lie," I've heard 'em say it at times
"Cream rises to the top," is a favorite of mine
And the cream of this crop you'll admit is impressive
But to quote the boy Hov, "Gotta finish your breakfast"
And watch for the quiet ones, they bringin' the storm
Even with a man down, "The show must go on"
No time for crying, better pick up the slack
Cause ain't no guarantee that you gon' ever be back
Allow me to set the scene first
This little nigga no older than seventeen in a Martin Luther King shirt
Walkin' down the mean murk, where the fiends lurk
And the same dirt’ll find a nigga
Even if you tryna' get that clean work
He caught eyes with a bad bitch in a jean skirt
She gave him a mean smirk, he smiled back
He remembered this man that hit that shit a while back
He met her, fucked her, never dialed back
How niggas do, he kept it movin', couldn’t wait to get home
Report card for his mother couldn’t wait to get shown
Straight A’s as usual, his momma would smile
Youngest child, college bound
Knew his momma was proud
Cause he was headed out the hood
He promised himself one day he’d get her out for good
That made him smile
The favorite child, but damn, fate is foul
Drive by, stray bullets that laid him out
On the pavement fading out
Now he bleeding thinking, God, man, you couldn’t wait a while
My momma struggling who gon save her now, huh?
Now he fading out thinking God, you couldn’t wait a while?
My momma need me, who gon' save her now, nigga? uh
Yeah, he’s fading out, the favorite child
He’s fading out (the favorite child)
(Let me live, let me live, let me live)
Peak in my life, check if you like just what you see
Though you might disagree with my plight
This shit that I write is just like therapeutic for me
There's no shooters for me
Just some niggas that wanna prove to me they down
I rarely bring 'em 'round, cause they still stuck in their ways
Mindstate still the same
Can't help nobody till they ready to change
But I don't give up, I'll be here waiting for you the day you decide that you'll no longer be a slave to your pride
Until then, keep your head on a swivel
For my niggas that dibble, dabble in street life
Hopin' to get a nibble of American pie, equality
An arrogant lie
Told louder by the people that hold power
Listen, this is a setup
I know you feel the rush that niggas get when dollars switch hands
And you can say you got your bread up
But don't be short sighted
See, it's a war that's goin' on outside
Nigga, you got to know about this shit to fight it
I wanna help you through
I'm on the road to sanity with all humanity behind us
Hope they comin' too
These words I spoke are nothin' new
There's nothin' that you cannot do
The truth is right aside of you
Through troubled waters just canoe
Have faith for something greater than to guide you through
These words are for all, me and you
That poverty stains kept the pain buried
As that boy out of St. Vincent-St. Mary: G.O.A.T.
I know you brought Patrón, but did you bring a contract?
Ion think y'all really understand... how much this shit means to means to me, man y’all just-
I'm back home and y'all just sat through my whole fuckin’ entire album and shit that's fuckin' crazy, thank y'all for doing that shit man
I been planning this night for a long time so this shit is- crazy to see like- turning to reality and shit
And I appreciate y'all for sitting through this shit I want to tell y'all some shit
About this album so when you leave here tonight-
I know people been- people been telling me niggas playing the album like crazy and I appreciate it but
But we leave here tonight, I want y'all to know what this album meant to me
So when you driving home
And you playing it this week, next week, next year, whenever
You gon' always remember what this shit is about
What I had to go out into the world and learn- on my own
I’m coming here to tell y’all tonight this is what this album is about
And I'm taking this message across the fuckin’ world ion' care
Here it go:
When we young
And even when we old
The world is constantly, constantly pumping us with images, and messages, about what life is about right, and what- what we need to make us happy
In the United States, we call it the American Dream right
But what does it always include?
A lot of fucking money
A big ass house
A brand new car
A wife that's not even genetically fuckin' possible to have and shit
And bitches
And bitches too
They tell us we need all that to be happy right
So what ends up happening?
The world is setup so that 99% of us can’t live like that, but what do we do?
We idolize the people that do live like that right?
We call them celebrities
We follow they lives
We go "oh man it looks so perfect, I want to be living like them"
And I'm coming here tonight to tell y'all I'm the same dude
That was on the other side of the fence, right here in this city, right down the fuckin' street working at the fucking skating rink daydreaming
Oh y'all niggas love the skating rink
Daydreaming about shit like "Man I want to live like that, I want that" right?
And then I went and got that shit
But I'm telling y'all this
I'm not saying that to stunt, I'm saying that to say this
When I got over there, on that side of the fence, and I started to look closer I'm telling y'all
As not fuck J. Cole I'm telling y'all as Jermaine
As I really started to take a closer look at all that shit we want, and all the shit we need that makes us happy
I started to see for my, with my own eyes like wait a minute
That shit don't feel right, that shit feel weird
And I started to notice that, all of that shit that they tried to tell us is all bullshit and it's all wrong and it's not what we need to make us happy
I had to go figure that shit out on my own
And how do I know that?
How do I know that?
This is how I know that
It's a man right now in the world, he got millions of fucking dollars, he got a billion fuckin' dollars right
He got everything that we think we need to be happy, he got it
He got the money, he got the cars, he got the big ass crib, 3 or 4 of them bitches, he got the genetically impossible wife, and he got bitches. But yet, this dude is fucking miserable right, he's empty inside, he's miserable
But you got a family, that comes from where we come from, from this city right here, worse conditions than what we come from
They couldn't afford to a ticket to this show tonight if they fucking wanted one right?
But yet somehow, they got more happiness and joy in their life right now than this man will ever have in his life
How is that possible?
How's that even possible?
He got everything they told us we need to be happy and he's miserable
And they ain't got shit
But they happy
What do they got that he don't got?
(Love)
What's that?
(Love!)
That's that fuckin' Cumberland County public education system there coming into play Goddammit
I need everyone to put your cell phones in the sky one time tonight Fayetteville we gonna light this shit up one time
Ay yo
A nigga been dreaming about this shit
I grew up in the city and though sometimes we had less
Shit
Cause what's money without happiness?
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
2,6, Fayetteville, Fayettenam, I fuckin' love ya'll
My name is J. Cole, Cole World
This been some legendary shit man until the next time God dammit
Peace and love
Mm, lucky me (Me), pressure's what I eat (Woah)
Ain't no roses at my feet, just the blood on the concrete (Hit-Boy on the beat, so bitch you gotta go berserk)
Look, the mission is covert, I stuck to the code
And you don't know the code word
Once they start me up, just know that it's over (Woah, woah)
My soul is solace, surrounded by angels
And soldiers on soldiers
World turned me cold, gang turned me colder
Sittin', 'course I look like I'ma beat a fuckin' feature on her (Like woah)
Cup runneth over and she comin' over (Woah)
And she told me that her lil' bro wanna be me when he older (That's facts)...
Lucky me, if they want my spot, then they gotta come for me
Just know I want this shit more than whatever it is you want from me
And the only thought at night that comforts me is starvin' whoever's huntin' me
Shit, lucky me, to be rich and...
Lyrics from Interview
Lucky me, I was diagnosed with a heart disease at 19
Doctors said they had to cut it open, put a pacemaker on it to put it back on beat
'Til my mother took me to holistic doctors and they prescribed me magnesium for two weeks
Went back to the regular doctors, and they said, “Huh? Damn, looks like we don’t need to proceed"
White flag (Ah-ahaaa-ahaah)
I’m waving a white flag (Ah-ahaaa-ahaah)
White flag, baby
Okay, yo, niggas don't want drama (nah)
See they talk proper, but when it comes time to spark
They all tryna catch alzheimers
You all talking no wack shit
You outta get smacked faggot
I seen harder niggas in drag
I'm bigger than that
So test me, don't even ask about it
Do the math and count it
You ain't got half the talent
Niggas laugh and doubt it
But only 'till my cash is sprouted
Put up your best track, I'll run laps around it
Yo, I'm coming for death, you running for life
Fuck a gun or a knife
My numbers is right
Enough of this hype
Let's get to it
Nigga you sick, prove it
Your style's transparent
Mr. Magoo could look through it
And it's true I'm not a thug, but I handle mines
And grammar wise you analyze, I vandalize
Which man standing trying to get branded with death
Falling off stage with a mic stand on your chest
Yo, take a number
Cause all these niggas thinking they can rumble with the rapist
Suffer from some sort of brain disorder
The rain is pouring now
Nigga check the brain storm
Won't stop until my name is embroidered on the gravestone
Embarrassment, how bad too delicate for carelessness
You out your element
Syrhenz (×4)
Loose cannon, when I shoot amateurs
Ain't a crew standing can do damage
This shit is rock solid
Niggas bark harder than rottweilers
I rock polish, I spit top notch
You rock bottom
Assed out, my raps similar to a crack house
So dope these niggas take two puffs then pass out
Relax now, never back down
When the bells rung, cause I serve beef raw but well done
You can tell hell where I hail from
The reigning champ, main event rhyming
Y'all still in training camp
Fucking with me so you gotta be nice
But you got better odds trying to hit the lottery twice
Nucka, stop the nonsense or get knocked unconscious
The rhymes I'm designing is monstrous
My arsenal bomb shit
Got the haters loving it now
Watch my shit hit the ceiling
'Till it's covered in brown
The therapist leading the pack
Type of cat to ball
You call without asking, no bringing it back
I'm made checking
Place your wages and bets
The stakes is raising
If you ain't gotcha money on me, you brain's defecting
Pains ejecting, whenever my name is mentioned
The games is lynching, hang and hitch me
This natural instinct
More than half you faggots against me
Now watch as I turn this beat to minced meat
Case closed, snap souls along with pesos
My entire camp play cold, below the waist blows
Never take no for responses, I'm word boxing
The therapist niggas
Yo, you out your element
What the fuck niggas thinking 'bout
Yo, check it, yo
Yeah niggas, yo you out your element
What the fuck ya'll niggas thinking 'bout
Yeah, nigga
Hey, yeah, nigga
Ayy, many blessings sent from heaven, thanking God to be alive
Flight attendant woke me up said, "Mr Cole you have arrived, welcome"
In this game the price of fame is steep, Lord help 'em
Keep 'em sane, prayin' that the heat won't melt 'em
I'm headed to the top, I couldn't be more welcome
Took the lead role, now look I'm right outside your peephole
That's for the crown holders, never would I dethrone
But if you ever leave home, don't worry, I keep your seat warm
So yeah, I'm Simba in a sense, I'm the prince
You impostors no Mufasa's, but there's Oscars for you gents
When I say I'm better then you niggas don't mean no offense
But is clear with no tints, man, just check the fingerprints
You'll see we not the same, I got a shit list with lot's of names
And plus hit list with of rappers I'ma cock and aim
Then it's who shot ya, mane? Finally figured out the game
Got nuttin' to lose, and a whole fuckin' lot to gain
What
J. Cole, nigga
Uh, yeah, B.o.B., nigga
Boy, Grand Hustle, nigga
Roc Nation, nigga, Dreamville
Crack music, nigga...get smacked music, nigga!
Look, you see them ruby red diamonds on my ice
You can call it what you want shit'll prolly change ya life
If you stole it and you pawned it
You should prolly think twice, well connected so I'm on it
Well connected on yo flight, you niggas be writing sonnets writing sonnets
Like we miss you we miss you
Mama go get the tissue
Them things start blastin, Mark Jackson can't assist you
Life cut short like initials, raps or the pistols
One way or another, I'mma uplift you BLAOW!!
You believe me, then you crazy
All these little niggas out here wanna be me but they lazy
Step ya game up get ya name up
Look how I came up
Remember this bitch in high school I liked said I was lame but
I played it off Deep down I was ashamed
But walking through these hallways, all you got is your name
The boy she liked was g-like and very slang
Whips and fresh clothes and so they doing they thang
I ain't good enough
I ain't hood enough
This older nigga stepped up to me at my locker I said put em up ready to jab at
Much to my surprise that nigga backed back
And went about his way
I threw my notebook in my backpack
Walked home just to get my thoughts goin
It’s a hardcore world if they think you soft porn
Niggas will try to fuck you
And steal, rob, or cut you
And we ain't sellin dope but we still gotta hustle
And this that crack music, nigga thatget smacked music, nigga!
I'm try watch my mouth, I already know what it is
And all the hoes that I thinked about
Ey tell me am I wrong for visualizing material things I never had?
Why do we cling to the villians?
Knowing they killin’
My voice screech through the street I'm a beast on em!
C.R.E.A.M get the money, dollar dollar billion
Cash rule everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
Everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money dollar dollar
Look hey
I'mma kill the game and invite witnesses
Yeah, look here I pay dues
Light-skinned so the house niggas feel me
I said I'm never going back No!
F--- an umbrella, man they banging outside boy
And f--- policing, they killing brothers what's the reason
Phoney niggas until they are extinct, boy I’ve been real
Westwood I said I've been real
Our love (love) our love, Our love (love)
Love the sound of love, love the sound of love
Playing in my mind, playing when I find you
I turn the lights off and turn you on, oh oh
And turn the music down just to hear you moan
Go down low, turn the volume up
Listen close, can you hear the sound of love?
Dear Mrs Bill Collector
I know you just doing your job, don't mean to disrespect ya
But I got problems baby
(Yeah, if you only knew) I got bigger problems baby
Like as if I didn't know man it don't mean nothing to me
'Cause right now I got my little boy crying and my grandmother dying
Could you please stop fucking with me, listen here
I ain't looking for no tears but my brother got a year
And my mother keep smoking that shit
On top of that I'm broke, please put that in your notes
And then I holla
Dear Mr Policeman
Ayy, am I wrong or ain't you supposed to keep the peace man
I could have swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
Oh no I get it I get it I get it
Or 'cause I'm black? Hmm maybe
Yeah hey tell me why my hands start sweating
I turn my music down so you won't hear a sound
Man I'm nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over, you frowned on me
With your flashlight tell me what do you see
Thug niggas drug dealers it's a trip
Every nigga in this whip got a mother fucking college degree
Yea, my middle finger to the law, bustin off, tryna touch the sky
My teacher said, "Impossible", but I'ma fuckin try
There's niggas dying everyday, man, we don't make the news
Instead they talkin bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole, top story, Tiger Woods "be fuckin all these white hoes"
Anchorman stop snitchin
Cut the commercial, he be texting all the side bitches, hey my goodness
How ironic, on trial for possession of some chronic
Hey your honor, is you kidding? How you sit above me?
Are you perfect motherfucker, how you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us
Dream like you never seen obstacles
Chasing obscene profits, so we ain’t stopping for the red lights Look in my rear view, all I see is niggas headlights
Catch me if you can, hoe, they try and sack me and I scramble
Look up in the sky, you’ll see exactly where I am, bo
Hey, don’t you see me, man?
Making my wishes come true, with no genie, man?
I’m on these rich niggas ass, no bikini, man
Got me up all night, all I'm singing is love song
She got me up all night, constant talking and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, talk it out with these love songs, she..
Is it safe for me to tell you that I'm falling off this cliff?
I've been hiding all my feelings because ignorance is bliss
As innocent we get we're still counting our regrets
Wondering if we forgive will we finally forget?
I know you've been depressed you've disguised it with a smile
And despite with all the fouls im just tryna stay in bounds
A line between my feelings and the boundaries of tension
If crossed the otherside have I sacrificed our friendship?
Is it worth it? will I be another memory?
I have to let it out because all of this is killin me
Everytime you smile I see the elegance and beauty
Because you are the epitome described into this loose leaf
Excuse me if I compliment your nose ring
The kajol on your eyes how its capturing the limelight
-we started texting you reply an hour late
But we pulled an all nighter gave me hope for the future cuz....
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Baby, I want ya
And we are we are we are
She got me
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune, Fayettenam hands up
The real is back
The Ville is back
Carolina's
Finest
You knew that already
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
Don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em take control
It's one thing you do
Don't let 'em taint your soul
Sing!
If you believe in God
One thing's for sure
If you ain't aim too high
Then what?
Then you aim too low
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights
I brought you niggas with me cause I love you like my brothers
Nights fulla Hennessy
When Hov around we switch up on that D'usse
Cause we from where you from

Cole, Cole fucking World, and I'm from the Ville. A few months back, I dropped this album, it's called 2014 Forest Hills Drive, and shit I don't know if people heard about that shit. They tryna say, they tryna say it was the first album to go platinum without no fuckin' features and shit. They said that, they said that, I ain't say that, they said that, but since they said that, since they said that. Fayetnam, if it's cool with y'all, and only if it's cool with y'all, I'm tryna perform the whole fuckin' album for ya'll tonight if that's cool with you. Can I do that shit on some Ville shit? Ok then, on some Ville shit, ok then. But y'all know this whole album is a journey, from front to back, this whole shit is a journey. So before we get too far in the fucking journey, I wanna press rewind and take ya'll to a time where I was just a young boy
La la la la laaah
They ain't got nothing on me
Hey hey
La la la la la la la
The lil engine that could
This lil nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick I heal niggas for good
Cause homie I’ve been ill
Since Hilfiger was hood (ha-ha remember that? Hilfiger cargoes’)
Won't admit it but if you was a real nigga you would
And now I got your chick nigga
She'll get out the hood
And no I would peck her but she peck on my wood
And she do it so good
I gotta thank her
I got her ass clapping that’s how I congratulate her
She like to roll the dro up in the bed go higher
Pepsi cola Michael Jackson and her head so fire
I love this lil redbone Maya
She be getting louder than a set of Dr Dre head phones try her
If you ever need her
She got a man that don't never see her
And when his phone ring he looking like "this better be her"
This unrelated but I wish I could have met Aaliyah
And when I get to heaven, homie I better see her
But what you think it's really like behind the pearly gates
No murder rates all the bad shit we heard of race
And can we still do the fun shit we did love and if so
Then do you think some angels work in strip clubs
Well if so I be trying to get my dick rubbed
Make it rain filling up their tip cups
Throwing ones...
Yeah nigga I'm the one
(Hey hey)
Say I’m the one
Yeah boy I'm the one
Now I'm the one thus meaning no one must try
No two no three no four, no why?
Cause I'm the one
Now every nigga keep talking keep walking
This the Ville where the real killers don’t speak often
But leave you leaking on the concrete police talking
My flow Nieman Marcus
You're so flea market so don't be starting cause Cole retarded
I be shitting on my niggas and my dough be farting
They won’t even say excuse me
Usually the groupies don't amuse me
Just wanna say I rate the tape my paper my loosely(?)
But can I take a lil dip in your Jacuzzi
Now I ain't Biggie but I got you feeling +Juicy+
Ohh she feeling like she never before
I bet she never forget me like an elephant won't
And yeah my name J.Cole I got a hell of a flow
I guarantee I'm gon sell em if you ever been poor
Or if you're trying to be rich
And this economy shhh if anything making money man
It’s probably this
Boy I'm the one...
A couple of yall ain't took a field trip to the hood
Ay me I'm Fresh Prince, I'm Will Smith to the hood Baby!
Ain't sayin names but we not the same
All that money and the fame don’t change the fact that u lame
Might wanna grab you a chain wanna tip up your hat
Might wanna purchase some game homie your shit is so wack!!!
I got my finger on the trigger tell that nigga hold datt
Boy I’m picture perfect baby you can check the Kodak
Hey so anything you can do I can do better
I’m young black get to live my life on the run!
Bet ya bottom dollar before I’m done
They say that I’m the one
Yeah nigga I’m the one HA!!
It ain’t hard to tell, I excel and prevail
Young niggas raising hell but talk well
Make sales, and managed to evade jail
Blessed on the road to success, wasn't paid well
But here we are, breathing, fuck demons
Never get caught sleeping, I’d rather be caught dreaming
Now me and my niggas be flying across seas
Laughing at the days we used to rack tall T’s
Now we rock shows up in London, wondering
How they even heard of me
Never did occur to me if I get to the top one day
Lotta niggas gonna be sending shots some way
Could it be the words that I jot then say
Across the bed, hoes you never got complain
One day, though, some day is on
One day you’re here, next day you’re gone
My life could be a movie, dawg; let me write the script
It would be something truly never read like a crypt
Little nigga with clothes full of hoes like a pimp
Far from a flower but I rose like a blimp
Now who we gonna cast for the roles in this flick?
Only bad hoes getting chose for the tricks
Who gonna play the lead, though? Will Smith? Maybe
Second thought, fuck it, can't nobody ever play me
Yo, some day is on, one day you’re here, next day you’re gone
(What's the value of a thing?)
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Yeah, I'm tryna get a triple double
I score quick tell the coach that I don't need a huddle
Mmm, I'm tryna get up in some trouble
And get it wet enough to leave ya layin' in a puddle
High school first time I got suspended
I took off your suspenders then I had your legs suspended
Got caught by the super intenedent
But you already finish he ain't stop what he intended
Yea, when other boys tried to get ya
And they walk up to ya ya tell em get the hell up outta my face
Cause they lames, and I'm playa made
I hit it for forever if ya ask for it (ask for it)
Put my city on it like my passport
Just live ya life cause they'll tell ya that's short
While I'm scoring points I'm a slap it like a blackboard
I told you, not to wear that dress at the club tryna dance up on me
Go up to my room, you've been such a, such a bad girl
You've been such a, such a bad girl
(Oooh, oooh)
Told myself no more hittin' niggas girlfriends
That's my old bad habit
Already know, what you staring at
Better than, the nigga let 'em in
Drama is a must
Kinda like a condom when I buss
I'm rotten but I'm polished
I'm a diamond in the rough
From North Cacs
Never could I come off whack
Some of y'all cats is pussys I ain't hung off that
Call your squad get every nigga off the block
Call the cops the SWAT team
All to stop me
I cock these
Y'all niggas is frost cuz you talk a lot
But never strap like a halter top
Y'all are not gangters for God's sake cool it
'For you snooze and pick the wrong nigga to fool with
An you get introduced to two fists, Timbaland boots are mint
And beat to death with a pool stick
I'm through with jokes
I'm through with stupid folks that say they get hanged
Whats the use its hopeless
You fools is smokin
Me loosing focus
It's like a mother fucker drinking juice and chocking
My mood is upset
Your crew is suspect
My unit is some niggas I dare you to fuck with
Plus, I'm the illest as soon as I feel it hittin
You can't fight the feeling revealing mi killah instinct
I know you feelin it
I, I know you feelin it
You willing to die, No
That's why we all gotta live a killer inside yo
Whether it's a tool or I use a knife
If the mood is right concludes your life
I'm bruisin
N I'll take it to any nigga to doubt that
This killa be killed and I ain't even out yet
The bigger they come the harder they drop
I give it all that I got
My money couldn't find another artist to rock
Harder I'm cock
Diesel i'm nice
Move like a theif in the night
Sickest Mo'fucker to ever breath on the mic
Is here in the flesh
Sincere when I swear I'm the best
Niggas ain't tryna hear it unless you do it correct
Never losing a step
Never losing respect
You act stupid and step I'll introduce you to death
I'm losing my head
A few screw lose in my neck
I'm not stable
I came real y'all drop fakers
You not able to hang one around your finish
I never draw the line unless you're surrounded in it
Watered down niggas drownin in it
But surrounded by angus
Niggas hold me down and menace
Crash you this major don't take offence please
Blaming your face is a basic instinct
Cuz every word I utter is intent you faggot
Fukin with this is like punching cement
I know your type you bluffin with tough talk
You scared to brawl
Never steppin but your mind is running marathons
It's hopeless, I'm focussed, I won't miss
Any fool wanna oppose get your throat slit
You can't call it I'm flawless this shit is so sick
If I learn from my mistakes I wouldn't know shit
Throw fists even if your voice is deep
Niggas suffer from arthritis their joints is weak
North Cacs where the mo'fuckin turf is at
You act bad but you rhyme even worse than that
Yo Funny how tables turn in life
Pay your dues earn your stripes
Never be concerned with ice
Cuz check it out
The more money you pay for it
It's just giving even me more reasons to take this shit
The main event, serving niggas
The way y'all run through these herds with these words is disturbing niggas
So leave it alone
I'm zoned and never leaving my throne
Don't need to play games, I'm in a league of my own
It's Therapist niggas
Dismiss you dick kisses
For you to get bigger your shit is slimmer than stick figures
Faggots can't stand how much love I get
But if you don't bump my shit then suck my dick
I'm takin over
I got what it takes to make it over the top
You tryna test me then stop and think it over
I'm greater than any nigga you feelin the most
Stepped off stage got arrested for stealing the show
Mother fucker
Yeah cuz I ain't going out yet, Mo'fucka
It's Therapist I got the killah instinct
Nervous Reck he got the killah instict
The whole fucking Crash room they got the killah instinct
My man All Mighty he got the killah instinct
My man Dialect he got the killah instinct
The nigga Volatile he got the killah instinct
Omen and Elite them niggas got the killah instinct
It's killah instinct
I grew up, a fucking screw up Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly I wish that I could tell her how I really
Feel inside That I’m the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I’m not that guy Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side On the bench, 'cause my lack
Of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' ’bout that now Fast forward four years or so from now I’ll probably cry When I realize what I missed
But as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I’m trying to stay alive In the city where too many niggas die Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? Ayy, who am I? (Yeah)
Things change, rearrange and so do I It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie I get high ’cause the lows can be so cold I might bend a little
Bit but I don't fold
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul If you see my tears fall just let me be Move along, nothing to see
I always did shit the hard way My nigga Squirrel slangin' in the hallway Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway Times Square
Kept the dimes there in the locker Some Reggie Miller With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch And he gon' get it right back
I peep game Got home snatched my mama keychain Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed And talked about how we gon' smash all the
Bitches in class I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that? Put me on," he just laughed
When he seen I was sure 17 years breathing his demeanor said more He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now? If you wasn't my mans I would think
That you a clown right now Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices: Either graduate to weight or selling number two For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me? I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us If they ain't want us why the fuck they
Never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear And thought about how far we done came From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the
Sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't
Gon' take what they handed Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive Ayy, who am I?
Things change, rearrange and so do I (Ayy, who am I?) It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie (Who am I?) I get high 'cause the lows can be so
Cold I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
I don't know what you heard 'bout nigga
Where I'm from, that shit'll get you murked out nigga
You screaming loud with that beef talk
Them niggas bring it to you, you gon' wanna peace talk
The streets talk and they saying you fake now
So when them boys pull up you better break out
You better break out, nigga
Better break out
You better break out nigga
Better Break out
Young gifted and black a nigga stay on his grind, that money stay on my mind
That’s what I say all the time, a nigga swear on his mom
And I don’t pay y’all no mind; no I’m just lettin’ us speak
A lot of niggas I know will leave your head on your sneaks
I should be stepping with priests the way I’m blessing these streets
Now nigga bow to the king, playa, I’m out of your league
Carolina my heart, and now I’m making my mark
I’m headed straight to the stars, you niggas taped to the floor
Haters hate when I’m raw, they rather see me dissolve
Don’t wanna see me on TV; they rather see me shut off
They rather see me do bad, I’m asking, “nigga is you mad cause you trash? I flew past?”
Fucking loose ass niggas, News flash for y’all I’m too fast for y’all
Talking bad, niggas wouldn’t shoot basketballs
The flow will blow you away, now niggas know you a fake
You looking for money, come on nigga I’ll show you the way
Screaming loud with that beef talk
Big dreams, big dreams the whole city was mine
Big dreams, big dreams, Benz, beepers and 9's
Big dreams, big dreams, the only limit's the sky
Got me feeling like the world is mine
Now close your eyes
Now everybody has a dream
But not every man has a plan
For some it becomes a reality
Slight chance but hey
You, you take it for what it's worth
Even if it just so happens your face end up in the dirt
Where I'm from the definition of work
Is a zipper some purp, or a key of that girl
I swear the city's bizerk
Wanted to travel the world
Leave a dent on this earth
I guess a nigga in search
Always trying to find an exit
Was tired of living reckless
In my mind envisioned myself driving in a Lexus
Uh, you'll know ya nig got it made
When the cops never raid and the crib got a maid
Why life as a shorty gotta be fucked up?
I just want what's mine I ain't asking for much
I mean, I had dreams and rapping was one
It was either that or ski mask and a gun
But you don't hear me tho
This Honestly Speaking mayne
This how I feel (yeah), look
When my ex look at me, all she can do is smile
Cause all she see is greatness when she looking at me now
Just wishing she could go back, looking at all the Kodaks
But she know I'm moving on and her ass is just a throwback
Music all I'm focused on, tryna get my bread right
Kush all I'm blowin' on, just tryna get my head right
In the streets grindin' with me, tryna get it every night
Dodging the police, staying out of mind and out of sight
The 318 love me, they waiting on my music
Cause they know this lil nigga from Jonesboro finna do it
Just sit back, and take notes from a poet
You rip it, you sew it
I'm the hardest, can't ignore it
Tryna make it out the projects, and get my city poppin'
These niggas mad at me, but can't nobody stop me
Niggas dont want to admit it, but know that I'm the hottest
All the niggas steady doubt it, but the bitches know about me
It's death before dishonor
Loyal before royalty I keep it a hunnit
It's real niggas over here, there's way more than money
I'm the hottest lil nigga out of Louisiana
Not braggin' just being honest
Fuck all you niggas feelings, you losing, we winnin'
And we ain't even started yet, this is the beginnin'
I'm really from the streets, these niggas rapping just pretendin'
Flowin' like they hood, but really know they some bitches
Real recognize real, and I don't recognize you
But I bet all of you niggas gon' recognize Snupe
Real street niggas see me, all they do is salute
Cause they know these niggas lies, and they know I am the truth
Me and all my bad bitches kick it like we punt it
My chicks 'bout business, not the ones who be stuntin'
Them top notch chicks, not the ones that work at Sonic
I'm just laughing at you hoes cause minimum wage funny
I'm a true dream chaser, so I stay grindin'
I shine like a diamond, I guess it's just perfect timin'
People though I'd be in jail, or dead right now
But I'm rapping, dropping hits, chasing bread right now nigga
Uhh, what if somebody from the ville that was ill
Got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn’t talkin bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Can’t you see I’m putting it down
Look this is the Roc bitch, the new Roc bitch
They had it locked well I just copped a new lock bitch
Look how I hit em up I’m on some 2Pac shit
We take it to a higher level two octaves
Cole, nigga I’m vicious with the flow
Don’t take no crystal ball to predict that I would blow so quick
Get on your current events, oh you ain't heard of that quit
No endurance, no insurance
You should be so embarrassed nigga you could have signed me
Now you little artist is garbage running behind me so
You wanna drop a man, your litter too much
Now get back to rap you niggas twitter too much
But I keep it hood I could fit in Ku Klux
I ain't bitter with you pitiful fuck niggas
Couldn’t tie my tennis shoes
Couldn’t reach this high if you hit a few blunts
Sound like who, ahh bitches you nuts please
I run circles round these rap urkels
And if he act Hercules then he could smack purple
Relax this is the Roc and guess who stuntin for us
And yeah I run my own show, nigga, Martin Lawrence
Young Boy outta Philly who was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around
And way before he put together words
Them niggas was selling birds
Guess who puttin it down
This is the Roc trick that old Roc shit
I got it locked, I supply the whole block bitch
Gimme the loot listen to that old BIG shit
And we dont care about no vest’s get your wig hit
See that boy vicious on the mic
Flow tighter than a girdle on bitches on a flight
Tight, pray for a bright day visions of a night
Good weed, little liquor pretty bitches get me right
Baby I’m a baller, I was born in March Madness
Whats the clarity its a little bit flaw in your carrots
Silly rabbits little bastards nigga all of y’all average
I be the youngest Jackson with the glove I’m the baddest
Get the baddest whore’s dime a dozen on tour
Box em out in the paint, d-cousins on boards
Hip hop deserve more for the strength of what we saw
Give an encore for Biggie smalls shakur
Big L and Pun, rest in peace to Pimp
The way they paved the way I could never be content
Give it up to underdog, highly underrated
And this ones dedicated to the ones appreciated
Good look…
This is a song about
When I was trying to get my first piece of pussy
Cole, Cole world
Hands up, wasn’t nothin' like that
Hands up, it wasn't nothin’ like that first time
She was in my math class
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it
If she sits on it, if she licks on it
Wet dreamin’, thinkin’ that I'm smashin’, but I'm sleepin'
And I ain’t never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no (Say what?)
"Of course I had sex before"—knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby"—knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew that I'd get played out, son
But she don't know that
So she done wrote back and told me
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin',"
And I ain't never did this before, no (Up top)
Practice puttin' condoms on, how it go, right?
And her face start blushin', and a nigga roll over on top
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause…"
Fayetteville make some motherfuckin' noise one time tonight

Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless
Uh, that's a stereotype Driven by some people up in Aerial Heights
Here's a scenario Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil' Terio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show Yeah, fuck nigga I'm very sure, heh
When I'm back home I'm the
Best in the South When I'm in LA I'm the best in the West
1985, I arrived
33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Jokes on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of em' diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop
I need to know, how many people out here tonight, Fayetteville, have been fuckin' with me from day 1 I need to know
I'm talkin' 'bout when a nigga was passin' his mixtape out the fuckin' mall and shit
He like, "you passed me one, nigga"
I'ma do this shit ion' care if there's only like 5 or 6 people in here that know this shit I don't give a fuck
I'ma do this song for anybody out here tonight that got this shit that I dropped called The Warm Up you know what I mean you gon' fuck with this shit
Or even if you got this shit that I dropped called Friday Night Lights, you gon' fuck with this shit
Now listen, I know a lot of people here, been fuckin' with me for a long time
But a lot of ya'll, you know this might be the first album you fuck with, or the first show you ever came to so I gotta set the scene for ya'll, I gotta let y'all know somethin'
This shit been a long journey it was not always like this
It was not this many people
I'm bout to take ya'll to a time
Way before we had these fuckin' fancy ass fuckin' LED lights and shit
I don't even know what the fuck LED lights mean, but I'm payin' for them bitches
Way before we had this fuckin' cool ass stage and shit, we ain't had to shit like this
And definitely way before we had this stupid fuckin' ridiculous, expensive, blue for no fuckin' reason video wall behind me
We ain't have no shit like this man
The only thing we had- the only thing we had was classic shit like this
Hey!
I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on Bragg boulevard"
Lights please, lights please
Turn off the lights
Ah shit
2,6 sing
Hey can I hit it in the mornin'?
The sun risin' while you moanin'
Huh, up top!
Ay would you drink with a nigga? Do you smoke weed?
The Sun risin' while you moanin', moanin', moan...
Cole world
Fayettenam sing this shit!
Yeah, this is for all the fans...
That waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like- Hands up!
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing
Shout out to the ones who know
Hold tight like I'm never letting go
I saved them
Never thought that I would be a role model
Whole lotta sour as the pith hire my own product
So cover what I've covered and money blown in drone mode
Power I was in love with it when I discovered it
Never knew I was barking at
Sipping on a roach, barely can breathe, I choked
No seeds, no stems, between the leaves of the trees as I float out my glass house knowing it's broke like how did they know
Shout out to the ones who kept on
Shout out to the ones at home
Shout out to the ones who slept on
Thinking God can't save they soul
He'll save them
Yeah, He'll save them
He saved me
I mean who woulda known
Picture me as a role model
With a whole lotta baggage in my back pack
Weed in the knapsack
Hennessey sipped like a cup of tea
What if life seemed like a dream, not Martin Luther King's, a fact that
Life lived clean for Jesus seems hard to get
Far fetched to a non-believer but I've seen and apparently I've fallen next to His feet in the sand
Like a lamb, He carries me
Committed to forgiveness to the dead that had buried me
In a coffin they carry me like a bride, I'm marrying at the side of the King
I arrived meet Him at the sky
Fly and say bye to the world I tarried in
He was sent for me
I could never be
Anything to Him
He chose to be a friend of me
Been His enemy
Stressing over petty beef used poison as a remedy
Sentence too long, same song different melody
Product of what the world was selling me
What I better be made new in the image of the heavenly
Seconds can measure what I treasure in this life but I inherit in what the screaming mean
And what I could never be, never dreamed to believe but I seek and move, sprout trees
The moment I open up your palm, the doubt leaves
The presence of the Holy Spirit just surrounds me
It drowns me
The waters that I walk on, astounding and they say
Soon as they wake, we crept on
Hold tight I could never let them go
I can't save them
No God, only You
Only You can save 'em
Thinking God can't save my soul
He could save them
He could save them yeah, yeah
Who woulda thought I would be a role model
Only following after You Lord
Shame on you
If you fool me we can't get fooled again
The world ain't gonna fool me no more
Xist
Stick to the script boy, get hit boy
My life a movie, enjoy
I’m glad you waited, we finally here
This is that, that World Premiere
Come get with it
I’m ’bout to get it
You fuckin’ critic, you talk, I live it
To the coffin with it, I don’t need your reviews
Let's start the show and fuck the previews
Sing, oh right, oh
This is my canvas, sing!
But, but the only thing like home I've ever known
But she put up with my ways 'cause she loves me like you do
I love you mama, go!
Best friends really make great frenemies
'Cause without me you wouldn't exist
Fayetteville I need y'all to make some motherfuckin' noise one time
Tonight, goddamn it for your motherfuckin' selves
At the stop sign, I looked both ways, pumpin' Ojays
My pops put me on that, catchin' a contact
And weed blew from the backseat, two niggas I just met
A month ago, I'm starin' in the rearview, suspect
I catch a screwface from one of them two-faced niggas
I'm wonderin' how these two snakes ever snuck in my crew
Wait, they knew Filthy, now these clowns in the back of my ride
But I ain't mention Nervous on the passenger side
He tipsy yellin', "Yo my 10 G's in the trunk plus yours
I know you young but this the most dough you've seen thus far"
I tried to smile but barely did, I glanced in the backseat
Feelin' like these cats got plans to attack me
But maybe that's weed smoke makin' me so
Paranoid of some snakes, Nervous asked me was I straight
Said it's written on my face, what was up?
Eyes motioned to the back, I said "nothin' much"
I turned the CD up, a coincidence, Ojays, backstabbers
I laughed at the irony, them niggas still eyein' me
It must have been the alcohol cause suddenly I shouted
"Y'all know this is your favorite song, what the fuck you poutin' for?"
Nervous told me chill out, them niggas just smiled
One turned to his man, started whisperin' loud
I couldn't tell what he was sayin' though
I turned around and said "You got somethin' to say, then say it, ho"
And before I knew it, mad movement, both them niggas popped out gats
Reply "pull the fuck over, nigga, how 'bout that?"
Fuck man I knew these niggas was some fake ass vests
Couldn't trust as far as I could smell their stank ass breath
I pulled over to the side, looked at Nervous
I guess he sobered up, they told us open the trunk and get out slowly
Said "let me see your hands, show me
And if you make a move for your weapon, it's over, homie"
I wished we had one but wasn't packin'
Bad mistake as this nigga pistol whipped my face and I ate pavement
Grabbed the cash out the trunk, hopped in the front
We just stood there, shocked, pride hurt, plus our pockets
Told Nervous, "Time to mobilize", he looked at me and nodded
Yeah, pride hurt, plus our pockets
Yeah, life's a bitch, the type of chick who likes to kiss and tell
I'd like to switch this life, I'm talking to the wishing well
Tired of missions failed
Why do they wish us well?
Know when they wish us L's
This is hell, but i won't cry like little girls
No, I just keep on dreamin' on
Got a plot to be the greatest, it's the top I'm scheming on
Like a doctor, I got patience, I know it won't be that long
So when all your voices gone, man, I'll still be singing on
(Like)
Say I'm a loser, OK, what, cause i'm losing one round?
Oh, now I'm losing my way? Cause my reviews are thumbs down?
I pay no mind, cause I know time is life's windex
So in due time, you'll see clearly just who gon' raise that index
Finger, Let's see who falls like Jenga
Who gets the glory, boy meets world, let's see who gets Topenga
Man, when you losing nobody gon' talk to you like strangers
Look mama, I made it, won't you know it
Everybody speak my language, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, up top, hands, sing
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone
And saw it was a number missing
One day you'll have to decide, who you gon' be
Who's the king?
Watch Iggy lose the Grammy as a nigga crack a smile
Livin' life but it feels like the end of it
It's a cold world when you don't got a friend in it
Hell, what am I to do?
What if I don't give a damn what I am to you?
I do this shit for me, it's like therapy
That's why I keep the pen around
'Cause you were never there for me but it is
And you don't like the fact that I did this
But it's whatever, I could stay forever on your shit list
This time, I'll do it for me
I don't care about the money, I would do this shit for free
If it ain't about the words then it's all about the beat
Lose yourself in the music, put it on repeat
Tryna put your ass to sleep but the music got you thinkin'
Thinkin' 'bout your problems and that shit got you drinkin'
Drinkin' 'til you solve 'em or drinkin' 'til you're numb
You could figure it out, but now drinkin' got you dumb
And you wonder what happened, everything used to be fine
Everything I want now used to be mine
And it slipped away, wishin' you could rewind
Lookin' at your girlfriend, wishin' you could read minds
Lookin' at your watch, wishin' you could freeze time
Lookin' at your problems, tryna throw the peace sign
Deuces, and get the hell up outta there
But you got no cash flow, you don't even got a prayer
Dang, it's weighin' on you heavy
You weren't even ready and it hit you like a ton of bricks
Everything was cool, how the hell'd it go from fun to this?
There's gotta be a better way
Get the hell outta your bed and get a better day
On your mark, get ready, set
Always right I never left
Exhales, exiting hell, thank God for every breath
Shaking the devil wearing a cherry dress
Staying sincere as Nas on his belly shit
(Yes, now watch me go)
Can we get higher, probably, it’s not a thing
Nigga’s still talking ’bout dollars, Obama just wanted change
Decided you want that fire that go straight to your vein
Or do you want that Waka Flocka Flame?
(Now watch me go)
No one dissin’, I’m fine with co-existing
My lines is so intensive, my grind’s like toting pistons
From outta these bars, I shine like Sonny Liston
Now are you listening? Good
(Then Watch me go)
I’m so a Christian, but niggas at home is dissin’
Feeling drunk off of power, I’m bringing back prohibition
Niggas is loading pistols, to bring it to where I’m living
I promised y’all I would win it
Showing it off, knowing I’m raw, oh my voice throwin’ you off?
Well how about I shout it from the same cliff I’m throwin you off?
Ahh, you on my balls, you should hold em, I’ll cough
Still a D list, but at least on the list
Of emcee’s you cannot compete with, got a buzz
Now all a sudden, these honey’s that I could never be with
All hopping on XV dick
You get shelved while movers is moving dressers
To my new house, where my old one? psh, I gave them my successor
And them girls wanna come through so I’m deciding who’s better
Cause they hard to deal with like playing cards glued together
(Watch me go)
With the flow and it’s always getting better
Call me Guinness book murderer, I’m killing every record
Ya’ll got half-assed class, you just a semester,
Spend yo' whole day chasing birds, call yo ass Sylvester
The elephant in the room gave me thick skin
Horton heard a "Who," and the labels just pitched in
Who woulda thought, that the way that I clinch pens
Would have me falling in love with the green with a Grinch grin
‘O11 dropping blow up records
Tour bussin’ with bars he's moving
Smoking with J. Crow and captain
Had so many L’s thought we was going 0-11
Now I gotta do a show in a second
(Hold up, now watch me go)
Reaching the final level, my body glow
First it was my hands, then it was my soul
A lot of people loved it, but those that don’t know how a Kansas boy flow
(oh, watch me go)
Yeh, yeh, watch me go
Now watch me go!
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich Look at me my nigga Fantasize about a white picket fence With some trees my nigga

Up and down between your thighs all night 'til sunrise?
Girl I give you how you want it, hard and stiff in ya stomach
Yo my love muscle make your knees buckle
Rough sex never subtle, my game tight just like my knuckle

Smellin body shop fresh, ready for some hot sex

What you waitin on baby? Yo I came to put it on
I make it hot like a sauna, put you on a camcorder
Make you a star and call you somebody's granddaughter
Fuck you cause there
There is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to ride/write alone, be in my zone
Had no clue what you was going through, how could you be so strong?
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl
Damn she so selfless, but she put up with my ways
Because she loves me like you do
Wish you could live forever, so we could spend more time together
(I love you mama)
Apparently, you believe in me, you believe in me
Apparently, you believe in me and I thank you for it
Another day another rhyme ho
Another day another time zone
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me
Nigga please
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga
Uh, couldn't resist
Like thanks for the view
Waiting on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit gave you the blueprint don't forget
Cold as your phone on zero percent Going Off, now niggas showing off
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
May I kick a little something for the G's and cold hearted niggas that's freezin'
Everythang happens for a reason
But why a nigga stuck shit, this ain't nothing for the radio, nah this ain't nothing for the radio
Nah, this right here what you've been waiting for, hey this right here what you've been waiting for
Woop ! (Turn the lights on)
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (x2)
Now I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet, but that’s how good your ass is
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter, probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rocking with the best mane, dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed mane, let you play with the stick - Ovechkin
She calling, she texting, she’s falling, but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate girl cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming offa my last name cause I really can’t take no stressing
'bout where I done been, who I done hit, your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy”
But I’m signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
We share something so common, but still so rare
And I’m in awe, never been here before
So high, we’re still climbing
Even here inside these walls, breaking each others hearts
And we don’t care cause we’re so
And I'm not from Texas but I hold 'em, rope 'em, and I yoke they neck
You gon make a player choose, show me what that thang'll do
Class is in session, let me show you a thang or two
I'll strip ya, I'll strip ya down to your bare minimums
And I'll, I'll lick ya, I'll lick ya down, you taste like cinnamon
And I'll grab a little bit of that whip cream
Then I'll put her on the back, get mean
Then I'll get her in a matrix, cut her like lasik
Basically make her scream
At the top f her lungs, give her shortness of breath
How many times can you cum before I poke you to death
Someone call in the ref', Ludacris is tired of playin
In the middle of the stage with an ass like that, you got everybody sayin
All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still surviving
Cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even tho' I fell way
And it hurts, cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together
Me and Disaster drawn together
I swear I need an eraser
I'm tryna chase the paper, I swear that shit is evasive
Stress has settled in, I'm tryna stick to my objectives
But stuck on anti-depressants
Escaping my adolescence...
And I'm screaming why me
Ain't no stickers on my stitchin, still niggas gon try me
If I ran I wonder if you niggas finna find me
My team is behind me
Or just me and Wiley...
I'm still runnin til I'm seein green
I'm a fiend of that fuckin Irene
By the time I get clean, I'mma be a fuckin great
Big ups if you with the team, and nigga fuck you if you ain't
Make no mistake nigga
I'm a boss of trades
Got my teeth grimy on the grind, we can floss for days
Real niggas listenin' strictly from recognition
Aw shit, you ain't a fan? You lookin' awful strange
I'mma be a king, that's something I had knew at birth
And now I'm tryna get some dollars 'fore the dollar lose it's worth
I might risk losin my mind, cause I ain't tryna lose the earth
We should be tryna make a change, we just tryna do shit first
Been here, but I'm back, crucified with heavy nails
10 year time lapse, Veggie Tales to reggie sales
Robbed for my bud out a transformers backpack
And now I'm in a wave of hella niggas bringin rap back
My pure determination, muhfuckas can't match that
The speed of my drive, muhfuckas can't catch that
Scratch that
Boy I'm in a new league of elitists
Black tees, jeans and some new Jeremy Scott Adidas
Slavin for my freedom, shit is so oxy moronic
Rather work for my goals then be workin at a Sonic's
Put this on a record bitch
And bleep out all the explitives
I thought I was in heaven, well
I guess it's all relative
Listen, huh

Roll up and smoke my sins away I’d like to go to St. Tropez Maybe I'll go, maybe I'll stay Maybe I’ll stay
She asked me if I'm scared to fly To tell the truth, I'm terrified I never been that high before Very bad reason not to go (I know) Terrible reason not to go (I know)
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid He's on his way to Hollywood He's on his way, he’s ’bout to get paid He's on his way to Hollywood Show him the
Way, he’s 'bout to get paid He's on his way to Hollywood He's on his way, he’s 'bout to get paid He's on his way to Hollywood

But that was before Lord knows I'm torn, so I–I cry (No I, I, I)
From the corner of my eye, baby It's been hard for me to smile Lately, it's been hard for me to smile Lately, it's been hard for me to smile Lately, it's
Been hard for me to smile
Fayetteville shit, listen
Ay put your hands in the air one time, throw your hands in the air one time, one time, up top
Put your hands in the air two times, throw your motherfuckin' hands in the-air
If you won't take me in your home If you won't take me in your home If you won't take me in your home If you won't take me in your home
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid He's on his way to Hollywood He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid He's on his way to Hollywood Show him the
Way, he's 'bout to get paid He's on his way to Hollywood He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid He's on his way to Hollywood
Y'all feeling alright man, make some motherfuckin' noise one time
This shit crazy, man y'all don't even realize this shit is like
This shit is unreal man lemme- lemme talk to y'all for a second
I want to talk to y'all- because
It's cool for me to come out here tonight
It's just an honor to be able to fuckin' sell out the Crown and shit and come back home and this shit is retarded in itself I appreciate y'all, thank you man
But it's one thing for me to come out here tonight and just perform the whole album for y'all, that's already amazing, thank y'all for letting me do that shit, you know what I mean that's already crazy
Niggas don't do that type of shit, perform they whole albums
But it's one thing to just come and do the songs, that's cool, I love doing that I do that every day of my life
But, me personally, I like to use the shows as an opportunity that I don't ever really get like that
But I love to do it
And that's the opportunity to come here and speak directly to y'all and have y'all feel every word that I'm fuckin' saying to you that's what I like to do
So right now, I want to talk to y'all about- this song right here that I just did
The name of that song is called St. Tropez right, that's the name of that song, St. Tropez
But if I'm being honest with y'all
If I'm keeping it funky
If I'm being real
If I'm keeping it a hunnid
Or if I'm keeping it fo' hunnid how my nigga YG fo' hunnid be fuckin' saying
He love YG, look at him (laughs) aight'
If I'm being real, then the truth is
Nigga, I don't even know where the fuck St. Tropez is at
I don't know it's at
I don't give a fuck (laughs)
When I talk about St. Tropez in the song-
What I do know about St. Tropez is, it seems like the type of place that really rich people go to when they got a lot of fuckin' money and they wanna vacation and be on a yacht with champagne glasses and bikinis- it seem like that type of place
But when I talk about it on this song it's just a metaphor
What this song is about, and y'all gon' feel me, y'all gon' feel me cause I'm home, and y'all gon' feel me
What this song is about, and a lot of people don't understand this cause I be doing shows in New York, Los Angeles, you know fuckin' Chicago, big ass cities
So they don't feel me, they don't know what it's like to be somebody that's from a small town, a place like Fayetteville you know what I mean they don't know what it's like
They can't really relate to that shit, so what I'm trying to explain to them is
When I'm talking about St. Tropez on this song it's just a metaphor
We grow up our whole- our whole lives watching TV, looking at the movies, seeing places like what- like Paris, London England, St. Tropez, New York City, Chicago, L.A. right?
And as a kid from Fayetteville what do we tell ourselves?
"Man one day I'ma go there, one day I'ma go there" right?
What ends up happening?
A lot of times because we come from a small town what happens?
We suffer from what we call a small-town mentality now what does that mean?
That means we grow up our whole lives seeing these places, and we tell ourselves we gon' go
But as we grow up we get way too comfortable in our comfort zone, right?
And we too afraid to leave, right?
That's why so many people- ain't really stepping out the city like that, they too afraid to go right?
So what I'm talking about on this song is tryna give y'all insight to the mentality that I had to overcome
If you know anything about my story you know when I turned 18 I said "fuck this shit" I moved all the way to New York City I ain't know nobody in fucking New York- but I left
I left the Ville and I went to New York I took a leap of faith
Fast forward the rest is history
Right now- listen
I want to take a break from all this album shit
And I want to perform a song that only- only those people that's been fucking with me from day one is gon' fuck with
I don't know how many people in here that been fucking with me
That's a tough pill to swallow imagine how he feel
He told me spit that real I told him hold his head playa
My negative words, they keep a bad smell
Them dead pres I stacked turned stale
That's money I done saved up for years
Just in case that karma come too quick
I be still on my shit, real shit
I got it in while them niggas was yawnin'
Had a pocket full of stones 'til six in the mornin'
It's like a full-time job not to kill your opponent
I can direct you to who got it if you really want it
Tossing turning cold sweat, that's if you're sleeping on me
School of hard knocks man I earned my diploma
And I graduated with honours man it ain't no lie
And them bitches think I'm dead wrong since I made it live
And they told me to get a job, a suit and a tie
So it's jet life 'til my next time
And its BFA 'til my deadline
Young Rod and Phips smoke a mary time
Smoke that loud as I drive bumping "Ready To Die"
It took a while to get this zone, girl don't blow my high
Can't forget them long nights, that studio life
By some old white cat in a top hat
Son of Miss Daisy whom my uncle drove a while back
Man ain't that funny how the tables turned?
These independents making millions while these labels burn
Got me owning my own masters, not too shabby for slaves
My old head said to get paid, young blood get paid
I ain't never been no one to stray away from the real
That's why I'll take the whole deck if I don't feel how you feel
Make you shit in your pampers have you niggas embarrassed
Try not to get too carried away like some niggas in Paris
It's obvious why me and Roddy click we trapologists
Gang,gang,gang i was raised on the gang since 1991 nigga and i will never drop my flag that on my brotherhood code nigga
Play with me you get shot strait to the dome nigga that's word's on my brothers
I was raised no food in the fridge blood i been on the street's for 27 years nigga
If your not gang with us you can't hang with the gang bitch ass nigga

Get your ass shot from the distance's with that a.r 15 blat blat i'm bleeding thick blood nigga
Dripping sauce on my fan-bingo shirt, bitch please i was raised on this streets at birth
Flipping packs ,with dubs in the rover shirtless not giving a fuck on that's on god
Sot nigga do you even know what that mean nigga i didn't thinks so blood
R.i.p to my young niggas who never made it out that's on god
Whipping in that new benz, tripping on my old friend's who be hating on me, cause i got a couple new girlfriends
And well that ain't my thing 'cause I
I ain't even got my own (Shit)
Nah, I don't wanna wait forever, sing
Hello, hello, hello (Up top)
Shit seem so, shit seem so
One more time, sing it

Trying to rap at age 48 it's too late
You think you can fuck around but you wait
You great, son you must but slow as a Screw tape
Whats wrong with you, you all bent of shape
Sobbing like your moms whipped you cause i wouldn't do a song with you
Poor slut, washed up, still rapping
How can I call you a has been, you never have been
The most wanted, most boasts but don't want it
The flows rugged, please know I'm cold blooded
This ho done it about to get his dome crushed in
With these words I'm sick, you ain't even got a nose running
But, you don't really think that I'm impressed with that do you

You back on the crack pipe, faggots a sad sight
Fag type, sticking flashlights up your ass pipe
You wanted beef so I'm dishing it out son
Before the bout's beginning I'm predicting the outcome
Step in the ring nigga with or without gloves
You be throwing the towel the beginning of round one
And I ain't got no sympathy for you neither
This battles a time out, I'm getting a breather
You easier than 1, 2, 3 your fucking weak raps
Just like my girlfriend, i know i can beat that
What Nigga?
Your whole sets blown
I fuck around and put you in a rest home
I'm professional, this shit is boot camp
I'm a 100 dollar bill you's a food stamp
Ravenous the faggot, the senior citizen with a bad back
A massive limp from his plastic hip
You never could be as nice
This nigga used to have a rap group with Jesus Christ
Yeah, aye, aye, yeah
One two, one two, aye
Uh, uh, uh ,uh
Look, look
Fast lane, living bad thang, giving brain from the passenger side of the ride while I drive
Blame the liquor I absorb and plus I'm high as god
Why is it lord that I can't seem to slow the whip down?
The same by standing up when them teachers told him sit down
Look now, I done growed up and still don't follow rules
Call those blues, nigga hol' up, y'all still don't got a clue
All the cool niggas from highshools that still ain't doin' shit
'Member when you used to fuck niggas up 'til theblue and shit
Now yo ass broke as a joke and 'em niggas doin' it
It's funny how the tables turn in life, nigga, you ruined it
Three kids that never see they daddy unless they need a dollar
From his baby momma and you still don't wear a condom
Is you stupid nigga?
Fallin' in love with these hoes
Is you cupid nigga?
You better learn before you burn, boy
See me stay all top of my game, David Stern boy
Did his dirt like worms but my mind was more concerned with the future
Y'all niggas stuck in neutral
This the city where police tryna shoot ya
The army tryna recruit ya
I'm here to get you higher baby, so this here's the booster
I'm tryna be the king nigga, this that Martin Luther, shit is crucial
Now let me introduce ya to the real
From the ville, still pourin' liquor for my niggas, killed yeah
S.E. muh'fuckin' Gang nigga
You already know what it is nigga
Griselda nigga
I ain't talkin' to one, I'm talkin' to all of you
Stay in your lane, I promise I will off you
Okay I'm sorry if I lost you
But this ain't what happened to Mike, these young niggas'll cross you
If I'm Mike and you Allen, scrap
Look what Mike did for the game and look where Allen at
I mean where the fuck is the talent at?
These niggas diss and I'm like where the fuck is the Talon at?
You think it's an indirect, I ain't name a nigga
Shootin' at everybody, I ain't aimin' nigga
I'll put you on the news, make you famous nigga
Revenge served better as a cold dish
Empty whole clip, leave his body cold stiff
In VIP, let the hoes sit
30 gold bottles, roll the whole zip
Million followers, you thinkin' she a cold bitch
Your WCW my old bitch
Bought a nine, front a nine, that's a whole split
Oh shit, I'm only 18 on my whole brick
Gotta give the credit when the credit's due
That's what you better do when a nigga better than you
Your head'll get lead in it from my revenue
Drop my new record, I'm sellin' it like the Legend Blue 11's
I'm a legend, you never going to put a hand on me
Without losin your fuckin' hand, homie
Caught a ki of sour for the band on me
I got it out of L.A. like D'Antoni
The kush good, but the sour special
Yellow diamonds all around the bezel
Don't compare me to these niggas on the bottom level
Lyrically I'm Kweli, you a Rowdy Rebel
It's funny how things change
I got shot in the head bitch, I seen pain
I'm homie from the SE Gang
I play my role just fuckin' you niggas mommas like Ving Rhames
Supreme hoodie on, three chains
My bars hit you equivalent to RGIII knee pain
Aw fuck it, I'm 'bout to sling 'caine
Throwin' powder around on my King James
I tried bein' modest
But you niggas can't fuck with me, fuck it let's be honest
But don't be mad at me that you niggas don't get acknowledged
Be mad at your homies nigga
They should've told you you garbage
You hear my flow, my nigga? My shit is polished

Me and you niggas never get along
My dick big and long, so it's fuck the world to a Biggie song
Aw man
This shit is funny to me man
Peon ass niggas man
I wish one of you niggas would
I'd smack a tooth out y'all niggas mouth man
Fuck be wrong with you niggas man?
And this at whoever man, whatever nigga
How you want it? When you want it nigga?
You already know how it go nigga
Do you wanna, do you wanna be (Hey)
Do you wanna be
To look behind and say, "Look where I came"
Jodeci back
Bitches screaming like Jodeci back
I call the front desk for condoms, she saying they ain't got none
The way that I'm responding, she know that we black, nigga
Fucking hoes like Jodeci back
A nigga would have thought Def Poetry back
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want her, nigga
And put a ring on her finger if you love her, nigga
And put a ring on her finger if you love her, nigga...
I used to walk around with my head down
Kept it up ever since you came around
You turn my frowns to smiles
And my smiles to frowns
But at the end, baby you always stay down
I know, I ain't the only nigga who's after you
I know there's a lot of niggas who's tryna get close to you
To be honest, I'm surprise that you pick me, out of all niggas who wanted you
That's something a pretty girl won't do
I mean, a pretty girl like you, supposed to have the freshest nigga in the school
But I can't judge a book by it's cover
By the way, that nigga was a fool
Cause clearly you lookin' for a nigga who got dreams, that he ain't afraid to pursue
I barley know you and already I'm going crazy for you
Honestly, I just wanna pull you to the side and say:
Hey!, let me impress you
But not in a dirty way, more like in a flirty way
Let me be the reason why you stutter on every word you say
Brag about me to your friends almost every fuckin day
Oh! And don't forget to mention that I'm your fuckin "Bae", Okay?
Okay look
I'm staring at you across the room
I wonder, can you see yourself as the bride and me the groom
Like, do you want a small wedding? or big wedding?
Yeah, I know I'm a rapper baby but I'm always gonna stay the same no matter where I'm heading
The way you carry yourself tells me that your pussy taste just like heaven
Been thinkin' sexual ever since I was seven to eleven
Damn, now I wanna slurp my girl up from seven to eleven
Let me stop before I set the mood
After we fuck, we always go and get some food, that's our daily routine
Eat a nice meal, after I just made that pussy cream
Fuck!, another one of my daydreams
But who said I can't make her actually scream?...
Uh (yeah)
Can I make a million dollars
Off a rap tune?
Hey (check)
The real is back, I'm here in fact
I never left, I been grinding for
4 weeks straight I'm outta breath
I been giving you all my answers
I'm not a test but I'm passing
With fly-ing colors, look at this mess
They steadily killin' up all our brothers
I'm in distress, I can go on for days and days
But I digress, The Revolution won't
Be televised man we playing chess?
Cause these Kings and Queens
Don't know they position but hey!
We blessed, I pray we figure it out one day
And nonetheless, I thank you Cole for
Performing "Be Free" on Letterman
Let's use our platform and try to do
Good for-the-better man
Cause it seems we all focused on
Clothes and cheddar man
On the media
That's all they really want us to see!
So they can control us
And we fight and divide
With no UNITY!
But I believe in US, him, her
Them and you and Me!
So keep ya head up
Let Rise Above and just sing (uh)
One things for sure
(then you aim too low)
What's the price of a black man life?
The cops killed Tamir Rice
And ruled it out a homicide
He was only 12
Let's just hope the judge don't let em slide
Cause you stay voting for office
When the justice system is a lie
And we try to get by
But look around, nigga it hurts
Wilson murdered Michael Brown
And was given a reward (a million dollars)
It's a slap in the face
Nigga it's stab with a sword
But the people will soon rise UP
ALL ON one accord...
Try to hold us down for long?
One thing you can't!
Fuckin cowards and scaredy cats?
Nigga One thing we ain't
So you can throw ya tear gas
White oppression and fucking paint
But we gonna stand our fucking ground
Until we motherfucking faint!
Ain't it a damn shame how many lives we lost?
Some white people they can't remorse
They rather not be involved
They rather stay neutral
Defend these cops and black ball
But if u ain't a minority
You can't feel the pain at all....
So don't get mad when I'm screaming out
"Black Lives Matter!"
Cause it's the truth in every sense
Of the word and the latter
White supremacy and white privilege
Is all that's around us
But I be got-damned if
I let that shit drown us
I'm a stand tall
I'm a do my best
On a mission for better days
And we ain't done yet
Continue to stick together
Until everyone's set
They say we fighting for nothing
And tomorrow we'll forgot
Nigga bet
Don't give em too much you
Don't let em take control
(you aim too low)
Justice for KJ
You gon' keep on hearing
Until his parents find peace
And a Valdosta a new sheriff
We tired of the racism
And the constant oppression
You try covering up a murder
And soon you'll be confessing
It's funny
Cause just look at the way that God works
You can reenact your statement
You can say false words
You can threaten the whole city
You can cover up yo' dirt
But nigga
Karma is a bitch and
She knows what you deserve (huh?)
(yeah) I said she knows what you deserve (nigga)
(yeah) I said she knows what you deserve
You can cover up your words
But nigga Karma is a bitch and
She know What you deserve Chris Prine
She know what you deserve Chris Prine
(yeah) Bell brothers
We know what you deserve, nigga
Operation Title Town (Bitch)
2Pac speaking...
She gon' ride yeah (She gon' ride yeah)
And she perfect (And she gorgeous)
Give her diamonds (I give her diamonds)
I can't wife her (I just can't wife it)
Chef is cooking (Cooking, yeah)
I can't to–
There are major developments tonight in the case of a neighborhood watch Captain in Florida who shot and killed an unarmed 17-year-old. The U.S. Justice Department has now opened a civil rights investigation and the local prosecute has convened a grand jury to consider criminal charges. Justice correspondent Bob Lore has the latest.
He ain't even do nothing wrong! We continue following a very hostile breaking news situation. There is outrage tonight from those reacting to a Ferguson police officer shooting and killing an 18-year-old. The community is flooding the streets of North county demanding answers.
Tonight Cleveland police have confirmed the 12-year-old boy died this morning and they are identifying him as Tamir Rice. The shooting happened outside of the Cardel Rec Center on Cleveland's West side yesterday afternoon. Chief investigator Ron Reagan joins us from there live tonight and Ron, it's turns out the weapon was in fact a police gun.
How we ever gone see 25
When these dudes run around like they got a Vendetta
And these phony politicians ain't addressing nothing they just cheesing for the cameras like we never been better
So let me get it straight, because of the color of my skin you can shoot me and my brothers like dogs?
Looking at the television seeing all my people bleed like our lives don't mean nothing at all
This is more than a trending topic on Twitter
So keep your hashtags and retweets
Ya'll thinking this a game or something, this is real life
They really laid out in these streets
I ain't holding back nothing
All these people out here sugar coating
Cause when you speak the truth they try to bury us
Ya'll don't want to face the fact our racism was built into the Constitution of the United States of America
That's real talk
This one involves the video seen around the world by now showing a man named Eric Garner being taken down by mostly plain clothed police officers while being placed under arrest. One of the officers employed a cholk hold, moments later while on the ground after complaining he couldn't breathe he was dead
Our Lord just make a way
We're dying everyday in the land of the free
The home of the brave
The home of the brave yeah
All we want to do is take the chains off
All we want to do is break the chains off
All we want to do is be free, all we want to do is be free
I remember I would just go on YouTube and listen to the loop of this for hours on end
Can't be bothered to think of opening lines
Hard to think straight when you know it's your time
And your attention's fixed on how your life's showing the signs
And you just wanna get your thoughts out, you're not focused on rhymes
Got school in the morning, I'm supposed to be sleeping
I'm too motivated to and my anxiety's tweaking
Way too many thoughts at once, got me feeling surrounded
Usually, I'd get doubtful, but I know that's dumb-sounding
How could I doubt myself when these people believe in me?
I'm getting to know the good person that they see in me
Other kids in the class wouldn't leave him be
Or just talk to him and then at him in secrecy
Got to know himself a little and he ran with it
Realized it was okay to be so damn timid
Put it all in song, now he's finna advance with it
Even if the ones around him don't follow his plans with him
Trying to find myself cost me a boyfriend, that's tough
Saw the bad that I was causing, things were running amuck
I'm out the equation, and now he's happier than he was
That's what I wanted, hope he doesn't think I left just because
Now I'm trying to figure things out for myself
How to kill off the self-blame and doubt that I felt
Found my wings, I'm just learning how to fly, so let me spread them
They gon' say I'm taking too much room, talk? Imma let em
Thinking back to when Cudi stopped me from doing something stupid
I almost jumped, thank God I wasn't bold enough to do it
Him, T, and Bino made me feel less alone
Like I'm not the only weird black kid they've ever known
Felt validated and represented for once
Happy even though I would still sit alone at lunch
I was listening to Good Kid, m.A.A.d city on the bus
Black Boy Fly on repeat when I felt like giving up
The music was there when I thought no one cared for me
Now I wanna be here for you like it was there for me
First I gotta kill these thoughts of what I'm scared to see
So I can be the person I prepare to be
Losing track of the bars, documenting this moment
Now it's 10:40 PM, losing time to my focus
Got a DM from Hospey, that just made me remember
We gotta talk about our plans to take over November
You'll find out what I mean later (laughs)
This shit sounds beautiful
And we out
1994 arrived
My life is summoned because my father found his beloved with whom to spread eternal love
And, spread the fruit of his loins
From the 3-point line, he shot a shot with such accuracy I had to join – I had no choice
The needle dropped, I preferred to play a song so quietly
But, my family name proposed the opposite ironically
If I didn’t adapt, I’d be crucified by society
I became a witness to the musical talent that laid within
A living testament, or maybe a walking weapon with a demeanor that likes to lyrically murder on a whim
I’m not joking
Fucking provoke me and you can meet the ocean
No floating
I wish your family well
You just disgraced your entire family lineage
They pray you living in Hell
Living on the sidelines has taught me all the guidelines of living in power, money, and prestige
Without the repercussions of not having a Plan B
Plan B requires prior knowledge of the situation only derived from experience and meditation
That’s why it’s laughable when young niggas repeat the cycle of being young and dumb with money
You look like an eye soar
Your ineptitude makes you twice as irrelevant
Yet, this type intellectual deficiency is prevalent and so pervasive amongst the masses
Like now it’s cool to put your brain in the casket
I belong to a generation that’s ostentatious
No need for debate, I’m well aware we all used to be that way
It’s quite contagious
You say it’s a phase that everybody outgrows
So if I complain, I’m just hatin’
To me, it sounds like you compensating for lack of skill sets
Your compensation shows – it don’t match to the real vets and the pioneers
The individuals responsible for your career
They possess the talent to eradicate you down to the molecular structure
Do not muster up the bravery to fight ‘em
You must’ve been utterly mistaken with mediocre
The minute you thought you had a chance, the jig is up, you losing focus
They see an opening, provoke your life source until it’s depleted
You even pleaded guilty to falsifying your credibility
You stand defeated
Not only do you get paid for being stupid, you get it for decreasing the value of what it means to rap
What it means to pack ammunition and then pull and release the Mac trigger
You stacking up in your bank account, now you thinking you bigger
What the fuck you gon’ do when niggas ain’t fuckin’ with ya?
You scramble for every bit of change and every bit of fame to stay relevant
They remember your song, but not your name
If this applies to you, this is either a diss or you can change
I recommend you change, because my sentiment will be disdain if you cause beef
I’ll only see it as leisure while you steady competing tryna scramble for words to defeat me
This is not up for discussion, my lyricism is lethal
Lethal injection if you choose to play the record – I’m evil, nigga!
Let it be known then
Really, though
Niggas thought this was a fucking joke
This ain’t no hobby, cuhz
Bring your A game
Hey, the funkmaster flex is coming
I told myself I'd say that
Hey, hey look
I got a
Chip on my shoulder the size of a golden nugget
The industry overlooked me for that I'll be holding grudges
Wouldn't take a chance on me suddenly its oh you love it
Lets get a Cole feature, thats gon put you over budget now
Picture being broke without no pot to piss in and
Suddenly your idols is your competition
Used to be like god to me, slowly losing my religion as
These notes from my composition turn to compositions then
Put it out and let the world sing
(Yo hol' up hol' up hol' up)
We had dreams just to make it up the flagpole
Just to find out that your heroes was some assholes, Y'all don't feel me
Man look, hey y'all don't feel me (Lets get another one flex)
Hey y'all don't feel me
(I told you he was gonna do something else, lets get to something else, lets get to something else?)
Yes sir, whatchu got?
Hey, hey, hey, uh, uh (Chuckles)
Yeah, yeah, man, look ok
Now that I'm blowing up, they money is slowing up
Them older hoes I used to know say "Oh you blowin up?
I remember when you was that tall" Ok now girl I'm this tall
And I'm ballin, I'm Chris Paul, they can't guard, and my whip dog
Look y'all, to my old hoes I miss y'all, how could I ever diss y'all
Hold but never kid yall, uh, I need someone who's gone be my baby
Not someone saying "What have you done for me lately?"
I took you out, I dug you out but oh that ain't enough?
You want my mind, you want my time but that ain't whats up
Time is money I can't afford that now, but girl you got the best range
And a smart ass mouth, So come here (BLOW THA WHISTLE!)
I really mean this, something like a genius
Ass so good, would have thought you made the deans list
Man we got it Flex, thats all they get boy (Ah, just, just curse who cares!)
Ha hah ha ha ha (Just curse who cares!)
Ahhhhhhhh
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)
They say I'm wicked check the appetite. We ain't half alike
They say that boy Omen a trip. Well I ain't packin' light
I'm somethin' like a raptor like, human sacrifice
When this mic is in my hand, I'm spittin' fire
Got 'em looking like, a candle light
I'm undercover, I'm like Columbo mixed with Sherlock Holmes
That's right, word got home
About your plans and your schemes
Fancy regimes, it's over with
TV full of dumb hoes
And naw I'm not no Overton
So sorry, won't be wife-ing
It seems to me, that only when we dumb is when you love us
Putting us upon your magazine covers
And I know about your history
All about your trickery
Your tendencies
And what your real incentive be
And how you want supremacy
You see I know your number, blow your cover
Detective Omen no problem with being the lonesome gunner
I know you act as if it's blessing you givin'
Food for thought
But I don't really trust this chef in the kitchen
Rolling around the town like a lost Trojan soldier
Appalled at my culture with all this exposure
Tore down our chapels, forbidden fruit and
My teeth in these apples is all on my lawn
Yo
Give em poor education
Feed em with degradation
Give em more segregation
That's how we can penetrate them
Condition their mental
This is experimental is far from coincidental
My gun has turned to a pencil
Treat us like a project
So they put us in the projects
Divide and conquer understand
Dissolve this it's to process
Make dumb cool
Then make smart lame
Make em apathetic
Don't matter as long as they entertain
Don't need the KKK
Don't need the CIA
Make em turn on each other
And kill themselves that's how we play
No fingerprints no inconveniences
If they ever trace it back to us then we can plead the fifth
While we eat organic apples
Their neighborhoods is gettin' McDonald's
Forbidden fruit in their stomachs, see it make em unravel
If they're ever keen & aware we make em seem crazy
And it's all going according to plan from what I've seen lately
On the low, on the low, on the low, did ya know
It's on the low, It's on the low, It's on the low, tell me did ya know
It's on the low, It's on the low, It's on the low, well did ya know
It's on the low, It's on the low, It's on the low, Detective "O"
But uh, yeah, man, I mean
Basically, I'm just, tired of all this shit and what-not
I’m 'bout to give you shit from my perspective
Shit how I feel through a, the daily basis
And um, shit I wouldn't want up changing, in general
Shit that I feel people should know
I mean, I ain’t get this microphone for no reason, my nigga
I'ma just explain to you some shit, whatever (I mean)
If you feel like you in the sideline then, this song's for you, basically
Ha, and shit, but uh, hear me out
Huh, fuck it
My flow is lyrically homicide, to get the case
A smile on my face as I get to the nine to five
I get this rap shit on my life
Fuck yo' favorite rapper
Give me the mic' and dim the lights
I'll explain my story, show my rise to glory
Shit, I'm still on that road
Just to let you know, I tried to blow like Hiroshima
Get it cleaner up on my screen-er
Walkin' like a mobster, eatin’ lobsters
Quite a shock to the fantasy
I show no love to reality as I gradually
Grab the Presidents from the resurrection
Came up wit’ two suggestions
It's do whatever to make the cheddar
For the worse or for the better
As I long as I don’t sell my soul
I'll try to make this cash forever
However, niggas try to break yo' fall
I mean, yeah, you got rhymes
But trust me, that ain't it at all
What is this serious lyrical business they witness?
So, they tend not to sleep
Do whatever to get you bread and make yourself eat
Look, I said um
I said it like this
Ha!
See, I'ma put myself on the map
See a lil' nigga put the bank on me
Cause I could bet you anytime, it won't be free
See, these niggas really wanna sleep on me
Oh, Lord
I wonder why I would't be so sure
But, I wish somebody had a guideline
On how to get up out the sideline
(Side-line, sideline, yeah
I said, ha, sideline
Where ever we go, sideline
Yeah, sideline nigga)
Look, throughout the pain
Sufferin' and the rain
I stayed the same learnin' the game of life
Only you can get cut off at any given sight
Maybe, I might become so tight wit' the mic'
Kickin' knowledge, while bumpin' The Chronic
I find it ironic
On how the theories of the world get through people
Knowin' they put fear in yo' heart just to make you evil
Please don't fall for the traps
Perhaps we can look at it from a slower perspective
And when it gets hectic, look for yo' savior
And no one's prayed for the wicked
I get lifted, I feel like I have the courage yet
They consider me gifted
I try to reach in yo' heart to spark a rage
But in a good way, we need change
Shit ain't the same
Why don't people care at all?
The Government is fuckin' us up
While in the court they ball
Killuminati rollin' through yo' body like a 12 gauge shotty
Oh, I see, I respect none of these fake niggas
Who would figure yo' idol won't admit that you're in danger?
Them riches turn bitches inside strangers
Ha, how can I live now?
When I never cried later
I say fuck the others who gon' become haters
15 year-old rebel, I write 'til I die, wit' my pride in my hand
Understand as a man, I tried to do the best as I can
But only you can control yourself
So what will it be?
Are you down for life, or just for fake wealth?
Pain equals passion, passion equals pain
Yeah, I tried to lend an open hand but niggas don't act the same
And, yeah, but, alright
Ha, look
You would figure life can never get any better
For standin' under the bad weather, wit' a sad song
You actin' wrong 'bout all the bullshit they say
Man, I'm tryin' to negotiate wit' deaths on my casket
That shit can get put on delay
Never gave a fuck about a bitch, but I sure love a ho
Bust a nut and then she goes
Pass the cup and now we movin' slow
Walkin' high up on my toes
Livin' life carefree, shit, nigga, I don't know
I express my emotions through the drugs
And fuck for the love of the sweet sex
Never being cautious, so I never use a Latex
But in any words, I touch myself to old V.H.S. porn
Brainstorm about the future, fuck the past
Roll the blunt and get the grass
See my eyes go to white and to an instant red flash
What the fuck I got to live for?
This song is for all the girls who's been called a whore
A song for all the niggas who didn't have the balls
To talk to that fine bitch next door
I always wanted to be that popular kid
Instead, I'm that kid wonderin' where my real Pops is
It's like the older I get, the more I regret
Puttin' my feelin's into women
I should've thought about all the pussies that I could be swimmin' in
See, sex isn't good until you're high as fuck
Sloppy drunk up on the pavement
Screamin', "What the? Fuck it!"
When I talk about my Step-Dad
I swear to God, I understand my Mom's pain
'Cause bitches play the same game
You can't forget about the popular kids
The ones wit' the Cement 3's
Nike S.B.'s, Gucci backpacks, Louis, Versace
Always the type of person to wish that I was exactly like them
Too bad, when they heard my name
They said "What the fuck? I don't like him."
For only if they knew the real me
See, being our normal to the world isn't cool
And they wonder why I say, "Fuck school! That shit's a hell-hole."
Want to put me back on my ex, "Oh, hell no!"
I feel like I'm in hell though
See, everyone knows Isaiah
But they don't know Izzy wit' his evil thoughts and his smart remarks
I never had it easy
Don't think I'm finna sell my soul
If you wanna talk then little nigga
I'll get you exposed
Full control
Nigga I'm tryna posses you cerebral
Then educate you rappers
With these verses I wrote long ago
This not my best work
This something to make you work
I got to all you rappers
I'm so quick to do the paperwork
I studied the rap game until my motherfucking
Head hurt
So none you motherfuckers
Can say I don't do my homework
FUCK YOU
Look that was intense
Look nigga I'm making sense
If you wanna go against and lose
Its at your own expense think twice
'fore you put your cents
Cause I go beast mode nigga
When it comes to rapping
I ain't really got no fucking friends
And that's just self defense
You know, standard procedure
These rappers on my salad
I toss em like I'm Caesar
Remember two years ago
The first shit I ever wrote
Ain't take me no where
But it gave me a good sense of hope
I never said much
But my music always fucking spoke
I drop me shit and disappear
I'm outchea like a fucking ghost
I leave the people wondering
When he coming back again
But I ain't famous yet
And so I'm working on consistency
School is the only thing depriving me from this
Industry affecting my productivity
Fucking up my agility
I need to go full time
If this is who I'm tryna be
The best rapper out of africa
I say that sincere
And hope you niggas is hearing me fuck it
Cause if you ain't ima prove it
I can rap man its proven
Most these rappers pollution
Add me to the equation
And you might find
Your solution this how I'm cruzin'
Okay, you told me I ain't shit
But nigga I didn't listen
Its two thou said
I still don't need you opinion
Yellow bone bitch
She short and thick, look
Like a minion, plus she suck dick
Hold the stick, and make it look like
She singing
I plan to K.I double L
'fore I take an L fuck the L
You take the L
At your face like L'Oreal
My girl been make me proud
No need to ever shout
I tell her lick the tip
And she pay attention
To detail now
This shit is easy now
No need for stressing now
I told you gimme some years
And I'll figure it out
The plan is spread my music
All across the planet
Rap in front of large ass crowds
I'll make em people say
"dammit, fuck it that kid got talent"
Fuck it who is you telling
Ever since I was a little kid
Growing up with no daddy
Felt my angers accumulating
Couple years you kept me waiting
That's why now I wait for nothing
See it nigga I'ma take it
This shit is hectic my nigga
No time to be complacent
What's even worse is that
I might not see my graduation
I'm finna drop out solution
To my damn situation
Man I'm tryna put out records
'stead of solving maths equations
Instead of talkin'
Like I ain't really got shit to prove
Instead of actin' like I ain't
Really got shit to lose
I'll keep it honest keep this
8 more than 92
Tell the truth
Legends before I'm tryna fill they shoes
My mom and I ain't talking
She says that I'm a problem
She says that rappin' and trappin'
Will never gimme nothin'
But momma I do this shit
So I can give you somethin'
In return
Time to let our fucking bridges burn
Man my only motto is just live
And learn till drop the
L and I fuckin earn
You ain't heard the sayin'
Nigga wait your turn
Keep your patience
Tie your shoe up tie your laces
These niggas quick to make moves
Till we expose they faces
Path of Life coming soon
It's KDoubleU, check it
The studio version
Had to get in the mothafucking booth and record this shit officially haha
Path of life coming soon, stay tuned for it
I'm out
Little did he know the shit was gon backfire
Was a older nigga to show her how to be a freak
Years go by, now I got her in my room
She talking about "me too"
LA on my next flight, you guessed right
Now everybody meet Miss. Me Too
And nigga, I can't fuck with her no more
Aye just in case you didn't know that
That Louis XIII is like $150 a shot
I can't fuck with her no more man
Yeah (for her eyes)
For her eyes only (For her eyes)
For her eyes only, for her eyes only
(For her eyes, for her eyes)
For her eyes only
For her eyes only to understand my perspective
It's all my fault that it all ended cause I choose to be overprotective
Damn, I'm nothing but reckless
I think, I understand why your momma don't wanna accept this
That necklace is so beautiful, hope your next nigga see that
He already know it's from me and he gonna question you "Why the fuck did you keep that?!"
But he don't need to know the reason why
Just know if he put his hands on you
That's gonna be the day that nigga die
I ain't gonna lie, I'm kinda scared that you might find the perfect guy
I mean, I'm gonna be happy for you but at the same time I'm gonna cry
That's gonna be the first time in history you ever see my ass high
Blow tree's til there's no more of me
I'm so fucked up but that's only for you to see
But don't be hard on yourself baby, cause I was already fucked up emotionally
This is for her eyes, do you understand?
This is for her eyes, do you understand me?
This is for her eyes only
Step on stage, a whole bunch of eyes are on me
Gonna tell the whole world what I feel about ya
Explain to them how I can't live without ya
Many friends, told me to go to therapy
That's the same shit they told me, when I was obsessed with Melany
It's a long story, please don't question me
Honestly, I know you fed up
Cause, you was happy with me
But all I could tell you is keep ya head up and smile for me
And no matter what baby please stay down for me
I know we ain't together but please come around for me
People do things for a reason
Like crack jokes just to be seen funny
Do illegal shit just to get money
But baby I wrote this song for your eyes only
Oh yeah
My nigga Deep Green (yeah)
Free my nigga Dolla (oh yeah)
Free everybody (everybody) (van dyke)
Joy Road, east side what up
What up big bro
Niggas know
Live life on the edge
I was raised ramen noodles, kraft mac 'n' cheese
I seen mama let the shit break her
You sellin' what? then i want a lil cut
Like a quick taper
I'm from the murder mitten
Some say the dirty glove
Out here gettin' paper
Free my man MJ
Told me he was comin' home in May
We was on the block like Dikembe
Dude did 10, coulda told
But he didn't say
Y'all cats rats with your fake ass, Kim K
Everything paid for
I done lost money but I made more
Steppin' on my toes Imma wage war
Now you got a price on your head
They'll kidnap your wife for the bread
Everyday I'm livin'
I guess I’m just your worst nightmare
White kid rapping designing for retail
You start trembling like you are scared
They used to think that I was mentally impaired
And now I’m the guy that you aspire to be
Even though it high school I was the kid you bullied
America loves the story of the underdog
But I do it big, so I study abroad
By my clothes, I’m so unofficial
I may be qualified as a UN official
Rappers start asking me if I can do their production
Nah man I only do in-house production
I’m not being rude, I just have no time
So I have judge if you are worth my time
All my crew is super talented
I would like to see you try to challenge it
They say YOMP where’ve you been
I've been here the whole time
You were too busy laughing to know it was my time
They're already asking how are you not signed
I am to my label I don't have a cosign
Dicks leaking
Shoutout to Jaxon Ford and Conflikted
It’s like dreaming is counterproductive
For some, it’s beneficial
For others, it’s detrimental
Life has begun
Exit out your mother’s chamber
Cock back that pistol and there’s no goin’ back
Ain’t no change up’s
It was your father’s pistol that put life in her magazine
The same day your uncle’s life was taken from a pistol with ease
From that day forward your father was a true alcoholic
Never missed a beat, always had a reason to be at the bar
When you was born, he tried to kick the habit, be a pappy
But it kicked back, he would relapse and then repeated the pattern
Growing up, you were too familiar with getting smacked in the back of your head
Being reminded, “You’re an accident”
It was systematic the way he made it clear
He would punch your moms in her face and make it appear to be your fault
His words were so convincing
You were so young, you were convinced to kill yourself
He was missing out on a relationship he should’ve kept
Now you disinfect the streets full of pests with a Tec
You blame it on his neglect
I never did you wrong
Why would you try to kill me off?
You used to call on me
Just 'cause it seems like hope that I bring don’t make a change
Now you write me off as if all your dreams are gone
The needle drops on the song of misfortune
It’s unfortunate he’s so unsupportive
Looked for abortion clinics to sever responsibilities
He said, “Fuck having a baby, keep it away from my vicinity”
Goddamnit, that backlash was strong enough to split your soul in half
Enough to wanna be picking a pistol up and make it blast
Right on the next motherfucker tryna look for some ass
Like, “I just lost my fiancé, why would you get a pass?”
The outcome so far from what you expected
He was acting reckless the minute he found out you was pregnant
I mean, he wasn’t the type of nigga to pick up a tool and flex it
He was so calm and collected
Well respected, check it
Even your family was in the deepest gaze
They was infatuated with his graduation, and it pays
You thought of beautiful future, now it’s tainted anguish
From the constant drinking and domestic violence, ain’t no peaceful language
A phone call from your father saying, “Congratulations!”
The timing couldn’t be better: three days from your graduation
All seemed well, you had a fiancée
She bumps Beyoncé as y’all cruise down the freeway
But, you can overhear your mom say something about your brother
Something is up; you can hear your father shut up your mother
She insists to tell you, but he says it’s not for discussion
He said, “Derell’s felonious ways should not cause a disruption
So, do not ask about him”
You threaten to hang up the phone if he don’t spit it out
But, he’s concerned that you’ll follow your brother or take a different route
As fate would have it, the day that you became a pappy
Your brother was tryna leave the game and make his family happy
Oh, such good news! You wonder why your father held it
Except there’s more to the story, your brother was just a weapon
His gang plotted on robbin’ you and your family
He intervened on the scene, became a martyr, so rest in peace
But, you can never rest easy knowing his mortality has been verified
Thinking that family never dies, especially not your brother
“Why was his life taken early? Did my success need sacrifice?”
Your anger shows in the way that you treat your woman
You tell her your drinking habits exist because she did not get an abortion
You refuse to admit it’s because the death of your brother
But now, 20 years later, your son has just become a statistic
All the while, his abortion was supposed to prevent it
Life is beautiful, man
Life is so fucking beautiful
This beat is beautiful
It's the perfect way to end like whatever the fuck it is that I started
The rest of my life starts, right now
And it's that feel good music for the soul, naw'm saying
And it goes like...
Ay yo I'm rolling up a spliff, bouta be high as a cliff
With the style that they bit
They need a fucking forklift to, raise they bars up
I leave 'em all starstruck
Arms tucked under this blunt we bouta spark up
Mind elevated, sit down and write raps
Smoking outta a white cap, where the fuck the mic at?
We complicated peeps, need to make up for the sleep that we lose when we choose to write our words on this sheet
Someone asked me what I'm up to and it sucked to say "not much, dude"
Stay at home and read lyrics off pages that I run through
The simple words of a simple complicated man
With a gram and a mic in his hand, sipping out of a tall can of that ratchet juice
And I had a suit from my Secret Agent Z attribute
Had to shoot every motherfucker that I disagree with
Got much love for the cats I smoke tree with
I'm making moves and I'm lit like a stick
While I hotbox the world with Anna Kendrick
I got a fifty fifty chance I'll advance
Your girl's in a trance
She wanna dance on my pants
But the truth is, I'm not that type of guy, that's not a lie
I'd rather find a girl with pretty eyes that I can spend the rest of my life with
Flipping off the light switch, getting into that night shit
I like this, goddamn, this is what life is
Goddamn, this is what life is
(This is life right here)
Ladies and gentleman, let me show you my brethren
Believe he gets the letters and just trying to find a better him
Let him make it evident, pass the mic and let him speak
His name is HideandSeekZoo and he'll be here all week
Ay yo my wisdom is infinite and my nonsense is crafty
Not much of a rapper I just talk over rap beats
You'll never catch me asking all the cats walking past me, "You know HideandSeekZoo? Well, he raps and that's me."
And lately I've been thinking, and you think I'd have enough of it
It's really all I know and plus, I'm used to loving it
Rather spark a blunt than spark up a conversation
Always thinking to myself, a back and forth interrogation
Like, 'Where the hell you headed, what the fuck you wanna do?'
I wanna smoke a blunt or two, sip a brew, chill with the C.L.S crew until I die or find something to do with life
And I'm turning my wrong into rights, still confessing into this mic
And I think I found a girl that can change me and make me happy
Cos I tend to push love away before it starts happening
But fuck it, that's life and fuck it, it's alright
I just want to find a girl that I can speak to every night
Cos damn, yo I'm lonely and I only got the homies
Roll a blunt and let it burn slowly
The one and only coming, with a style that is so worth the while
See me hungover on God's bathroom tile
This is for everyone who didn't think that I could do this
You're living life useless
Please get a clue, bitch
Still thinking, blindsided by the thought of it
The perfect life is a bandwagon, hop off of it
The sooner it comes, the sooner it goes
And I stay writing flows cos it's all that I know
Fluent with the pen, I smile as I write this
This is what life is
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, took a lil' sip
T-T-Took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip
Yo, let me tell you 'bout a crew I know
The crash unit had to come and steal the show
Whenever nervous wrecks and therapists come
To take you back, you know the job ain't done
And I know, oh yes, I know, I know because I'm Therapist son
Yo, check this out
At the high house
Work, yo
I appeal to the criminal minds
You've been blinded, this shit is so timeless
You need to open your eyes, you cat-napping
My squad blasts tracks, see proof, back tracking (Therapist)
Now what you know about ill flows, you not go (Ah)
You'se a suck off, bitch I'm a hard stroke
Etching my name in the payments so mistake forever
I'm paying dues, make more moves than the game of checkers (Checkers)
So get your back sticks
And when you come here, act like you have sense
Don't talk out your ass bitch
My raps is classic and crafted, I know the ropes
Sucker MC's never make it up the totem pole
Who knows and goes
Crash, you niggas starving now
Any faggot talking out his ass, better crumble down
'Cause I'm all about drama, my crowd too big to swallow
So trust me, when my mood swings, my pistol follow
What? After all weight turns out
Tools get burned out, your rhymes is run out
I immediately come out raw, ready to blast out (Birds)
Don't boast my roast, my very last nerve
I give the last word and the last how, ha
Tryna laugh past you, rap asses
Now sit back, relax and jack your safety buckles
The caskets tryna make me stumble, they just make me chuckle
I hate to break your bubble but I'm the freshest
Don't even try to test this
You only touch kids that's child molesters, I'm a lesson
Cat's like you, dime a dozen, you just play hard
Panic rapping, just don't quit your day job
My rap control is insane when I say rhymes
These goon walls can't hold a flame to mine
And as an MC on this dope record
Time that we break for a second
(Man speaks)
Yo, break is over, we taking over
Let's ride through your home spot, I be the controller
You can't grab hold of
Your catch is field mice, I'll be King Cobra
The ride of rude rebels, at level fifteen
The ends boosted up to ten, you know what I mean
It seems you got some bitch within you
My peoples stare down the whole damn venue
Not a part, not a fractional so what
Crackled ceilings and crumbled walls
Long terrain, immune to the pain
We save enough, y'all putting money down in vain
You ain't no big dawg, no pay day
You pay, them hoes pop, you get your wig peeled
You ain't no big dawg, you not no big dick
You paid, them hoes po, you get your wig picked
You pray my logo, I heard you pitch well
You tryna bug out, I sit still
Yo, I feel like you should both come to terms
Even though I can't smah up your concerns
Hypothetically or in reality
Taking you out, is a small technicality
Rhymes like these or rhymes like this up
While I diss 'em, soft, silly, low budget sucker like yourself
I got the style, you couldn't eat at my household
I labeled it sucker boy style
I like to do it once in a while
(Static speaking)
Now everybody who looked down on me
And told me I was nothing
For everybody who said I wouldn't evolve to something
For everybody who studied me without saying nothing
Let me tell you something
I don't fuck with y'all
22 anos, um diploma, mais um neguinho do bairro
Me sinto um judeu em Sodoma
Toma, pega essa bomba, toma é armamento
Não é aquilo que as crianças usam
Pra gastar seu tempo
SPOTLIGHT, FLOW SIMONAL
Lucas anti DOPS, não, não uso nada ilegal
Aqui o mundo anda mal, então soltem suas pedras
Temos o sujo e o mal lavado e todo mundo erra
O senhor observa, pretos prontos pra guerra
Eu vim pra ser espelho, esvaziar a favela
Lotar a high society, pretos em festa
Seu olho gordo não me atinge
Quer um pedaço peça
E sem usar uma peça, lotamos geladeiras
Se é motivo de festa, irmão cê tá de brincadeira
Essa é a hora da reviravolta, acabo com a zueira
Pra jogar meu bairro lá em cima
Subo qualquer ladeira
Eu, vou subir junto com os meus
Há quanto tempo no breu
Eu, só ando junto dos meus
Quem que ficou depois que o teto desceu
Deus, olha pra mais um filho teu
Quem que ficou depois que o teto cedeu
DEUS
Não adianta reclamar
Problemas são só problemas
Cê vai ter que se virar
Cansei do busão lotado
Um inferno pra trabalhar
Já chego no trampo cansado
E tem patrão pra escutar
Não entende meu lado
Quer resultado vamo lá
Levantei minha cabeça
Me elevei, outro lugar, então querendo ou não
Eles vão ter que aceitar
Mais um preto outra rima
Comprando o que quer comprar
Tipo pantera negra
Lucas Shakur, preto jaguar
Saquei tudo, sem sacar, levei tudo sem roubar
Tia distribui no bairro pras crianças brincar
Fala que alguém trabalhou e comprou
Não precisou roubar e que é nesse tipo de alguém
Que eles tem que se inspirar
Pra subir, pra cantar, pra resistir, representar
Se informar, se formar, pra sua mãe se orgulhar
E lembrar a favela que aqui também é um bom lugar
Sei que não esquece de mim, pai
Mais é tão frio aqui
Eu choro, a chuva cai
Mais te invoco, teu nome invoco
E eles verão teu poder
Entre os nossos
Shame on… (Shame on you, bitch)
Shame on you (Fuck off)
It fool me, you can't get fooled again
OK, I know this sounds like Hell Of A Life by Kanye West but it’s not
Don’t worry, it’s gonna be okay
These are just ad-libs for the song
Don’t worry, it’s gonna be okay, he’s gone
He’s gone, he ain’t gonna gonna worry
His ass is gone, he’s got a lot of stories
His ass is gone, he’s got a gun of stories
(now, Juanitox)
Confédéré, plutôt consanguin ouais
Raciste, puriste, t’aimes pas notre musique ? (nique ta race)
La grosse chatte à ta mère
Mais là y’a trop de MST
Yaoi, Yaoi, Yaoi, Yaoi, Yaoi
Yaoi, Yaoi, Yaoi (yaaaaaooooi)
Un groupe interracial entre un blanc et un babtou
À chaque fois que j’suis avec Bartox
Dépression, érection, je me sens au fond du trou
J’peux pas mourir demain sinon Time Paradox
He’s gone (all gone), he ain’t gonna gonna worry (all gone)
His ass is gone (all gone), he’s got a lot of stories
His ass is gone (all gone), he’s got a gun of stories
Grosses bites, grosses basses
Les sons de Y40i, ça tabasse
Je pèse dans l'game comme Gérard Baste
Pèse sur la balance (poucave)
Go fast
Je te mets en transe
Fréquence grasse dans ta face
Je te découpe en tranche
Aucune trace de ta race
Je mets mon joint dans ta culasse
Plein de crasse
(yeah)
Life resonating with me different lately
Maybe it's preparation, maybe it's more than I perceive
And time requires patience
My wisdom is aging
Expect some suffering while headed to greatness
So many odds put in place I've faced
All of the cards that's been dealt I've played
Collect them all and collect the pay
I would never discharge or run away
Niggas feel like they done been through it all
I look death in the face now
I've seen a man dead due to homicide
The type of shit that makes a man cry, a bullet through an eye
I couldn't fathom, Imagine Tina crying at my casket
I live to tell a story through this rapping shit
I'm advancing to deeper understanding it
Coexist with my plan, I've been handed a gift from the man
In my feelings and I wear them on my sleeve like a brand
Pardon me venting
Often reminiscing of the Northside of that Mob-Town
I never forget it, I never forget it
I never forget it, endeavors come with this type of living
Fatherless child, growing up, all I had was a vision
A pad and a pencil, writing raps
Comprehending my mental
Inviting you to a world that I've been to
A world that I've been through
And still going like I'm still flowing
I don't boast, I'm learning to be humble the most
Knowing that what is promised is done
Lord, forgive me, for being anxious and rushing to what is just yet to come
All the blessings I've won
All the lessons I've learned
Being tested to walk through the fire without a burn
Direction is on my mind lately
Driving me crazy, constantly praying
Begging for answers, asking "where do I turn?"
I know that I'm ready
But maybe not ready for it yet
But I want it so bad, can't nothing hold me back
Relax is what I told myself to keep it on a narrow
Tryna' stay on point like an arrow
Without making an error
The hardest in this era and your area
Tone, sacrifices made now I'm set in stone
Sacrifices made now I'm set in stone
Mann baichan ek jal rhi thi aag si
Shayad dil ko sata rhi teri yaad thi
Hai wo paas par fir bhi mere paas nhi
Har saans mein par diya kabhi dhyaan nhi
Kya aap samjhe sangeet ki ye baat thi
Jab na tha koi kalam kagaz hi saath thi
Mere vicharo ke the bane ye saathi
Inke bina zindagi meri jaise saza thi
Zimmedari nayi to shayad se door gya
Par na samjhe main tha unko kahi bhool gya
Mauka na mile main fir bhi dhoond laata hu
Chahe hun akela par khud ke liye hi gaata hu
Tu bhi jhaank teri bhi aisi cheez thi
Jiske liye rooh teri rehti thi cheekh ti
Par din ki race mein shayad bhool gya
Paisa matters more ban gya ye usool naya
Har din kama paisa thak kar so jaata hai
Par poocha hai mann se kya usko bhi chain aata
Reh kar door cheezo se jo deti ek sukoon thi
Chahe ho wo sardi ya fir ho wo garmi june ki
Par hua kya jo aisa hum badal gye
Kya ho kar bade hum thoda sa bhatak gye
Socha bohot par mil rha jaawab nhi
Chalo mil kar sochte hai main aur aap bhi
Haanji kya mila koi jawaab ji
Pooch khudse kya ho skti wajah thi
Roka khudko ya kismat ki khta thi
Ya socha tha sab baith ke ye ho jaayega aap hi
Ho skta hai samay na tere saath tha
Ho skta hai khuda tujhse naraaz tha
Ho skta hai khando par koi bhar tha
Yaa fir ho skta hai to kuch na karne ko tayaar tha
Kaaran bohot par zindagi ye aakhri
Aaj hai kal ban jaaye ye rakh hi
Himmat kar badal le kismat aap hi
Royega warna jab lega saans apni aakhri
Kehna aasan par karna thoda mushkil
Par rone se acha rahega wo khush dil
Hasegi na rooh na kahegi tujhe buzdil
Things will change atleast keep a strong will
Laga rahunga main apni aakhri saans tak
Koshish yahi pahunche aawaaz aap tak
Tu bhi karle sapne poore dekhe aaj tak
Koyla banega heera ye baat meri yaad rakh
Yaad rakh
Yaad rakh !!!
Down to the garden, took a little dip
Cole is the king
D.Koms
Cause my words gon' live forever
Baby girl you've been all in my mind
Came a man by myself, only father was time
Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Motivate (motivate), motivate (ugh)
I pocket a bill, I'm feelin' alive
I'm-
You know I'm on - that all white like Lisa bitch
Everything I own - no rent to buy, no leaser bitch
Better pick the right bone 'fore I jump fence and leash ya bitch
Break up happy homes and give no fucks like Alicia bitch
My pedigree on pedestal, all of my medals impeccable, looking so credible
Look how I hang, inches - several
Banking payments - call me federal
Higher arrangements - yes, the edible
Look at how you living bitch, look what you settle for
Quick to tell a nigga, pull yourself together
YES! I am incredible
Look at the prince, look how I sit
I be coming up like dick in her tits
Quick to buss a nut so watch where you lip
They steady scrolling up, you never the pic(k)
But of course! I'm endorsed
Campaigning with a big wig stipend
JFK to that Ronald Reg (Ray)
Then its Hartsfield to Virginia Highlands
Ti ricordi che (che)
Una volta sognare era più facile (più facile)
Di così
Forse ora non mi riconosceresti
Forse una volta per noi sorridere
Non era un limite
Per me e te
Era più facile (piùùù)
Più facile
Se parlo dei miei limiti non saranno mai più limiti
Ma è solo per dire che nelle difficoltà
Che siamo più simili
Io che scrivo questi pezzi come se fossero lettere senza destinatario
Tu respira piano
È nella tempesta e non col mare calmo che di solito scopri un bravo marinaio
Chi cera di costruire
È più quello che distrugge
Cerco l'ispirazione ma spesso mi sfugge
La rincorro in una strada senza luce
E la trovo a terra come un angelo, ma è senza piume (è senza piume)
Per ritrovarmi lascio sui fogli parole sparse
Mentre i fulmini cercano il ferro nel mio sangue
Quando ci rincontreremo, quanti anni saranno passati?
Due chiacchiere di circostanza e torneremo di nuovo passanti
Mentre ti guardavo pensavo a noi che giocavamo, senza pensare al futuro
Ora che sono cresciuto scrivo 'sti pensieri come se importasse a qualcuno ma...
Ti ricordi che
Non era un limite, per me e te
It’s Unknown Motherfucka
Yo, yo, yo
Unknown is a scary one, and my verses slay
I’m tryna see my prophet rise like Joseph and Mary’s son on the third day
My focus is to bury foes, with every flow, goin’ through their stero
I sit back and observe the game, a lot ya just don’t deserve the praise
And I’m not waitin’ for my turn, I’m gon take what’s rightfully mine
And soon ya gon’ know this kid from Thieriot is great
So I’m, puttin’ my pen to the page, cause I am not spendin’ the rest of my days
Livin’ off of minimum wage, I rather be makin’ a million for rappin’ on stage
People sleepin’ on the raps I spit, and when they wake up, I’m a be the demon during their paralysis
You should be scared because you asked for this
All I care about is havin’ cream and a bunch of hoes
Livin’ the American Dream like Dusty Rhodes
Try and come for Unknown, there’s somethin’ you must know, I’m cut throat
Think twice before you make a regretful decision, my pen is nice put you in the grave with the best flows and writtens
They gon’ gimme all the praise, and ain’t gotta choice
I’m a be iconic like Billie Kay and Peyton Royce
Motherfucka
Peace out Motherfucka
Woo
Motivate, motivate, motivate, motivate, motivate, motivate, motivate, woo!
Yeah, a lot of clicks on my page, now they telling me my flow is ace
Lazy rappers in the game, I think I need to motivate
I could leave and take a break come to find I'm owed sick pay
Dug this out of the mud, why in the fuck would I throw it away?
My peers are looking at me with the torch like "Hold this mate"
Many yanks are pissed at the fact that I'm molding lanes
I'm holding traits whilst flowing great
And you wonder why the fanbase is going up at a growing pace
Tryna throw jabs but you gotta slow hit rate
I can't fuck with idiots they show corrosive ways
When their bored they rely on one motive, hate
I'm proud to say throughout the bullshit I stay focused
So tell them other guys, run up on me and catch a bunch of fives
Messing with me or the lyrics you've come to die
You can't overcome my mind
My hunger makes me run on time, I'm brunt cos I'm
Telling these fuckers I don't wanna colab, but, much love guys
Tryna put food on the table for my potential family to eat
Coming up they asking "Who's he?"
When they say my name your crew flee
You can't spit for shit so give up the writing and rip out your loose leaf
Ask your girl for spitting advise that pussy gets beaten loosely
Concrete love my two feet, in other words I'm grounded
Rappers looking real looney, that shit leaves me astounded
I'm corny and weird with some bars, I'd like to say that I'm goofy
So you better start running before I start chucking nuns like I'm Bruce Lee
Now everybody say the city dead
But I don’t give a fuck what a hater ever said
‘Cause these cats is only in this shit for shine
So fuck them motherfuckas, we don’t need ‘em on our side
Now my people, yeah, we about to have a run
We blast these motherfuckas from the shadow of a gun
I don’t care if y’all ain’t fuckin’ with the squad
I ain’t scared of any man, I don’t fear no one but God
There ain’t no way around it no more, the city faded
‘Cause ain’t nobody passin’ the torch so we gotta take it
We used to be the front of this music culture but lately
We all been dickridin’ and chasin’ Jiggy and Mackey
Who’s the king? Ain’t nobody, fuck it, the throne is vacant
The kingdom burn to the ground and the castle there for the taking
This culture was created from struggle, the early 80s
Late 70s breakin’, Fort Apache, Reagan
Started floodin’ ghettos with crack, AIDS and the weapons
And instead of education, our pathway was to Heaven now
Know this shit is tired and passé, we mention it
The way it used to be but fuck it, class is session, learn something
We bumpin’ Bambaataa on Planet Rock
Same time, Warhol was fuckin’ with Basquiat
When Big Daddy Kane had Madonna all on his cock
There were whores on 42nd, Giuliani had ‘em locked
Yeah, I remember, radio broke records
When New York City was still a cultural mecca
I don’t think that Rick Rubin’ll ever pose for the camera
But them labels had another agenda
They been pimpin’ the artists for years, fuck’em
Even when artists run and we used to set all the trends
But now we follow what’s comin’
Or they regurgitating the same shit that we done with
And we sellin’ all them lies to the public
So fuck it, ain’t showin’ ‘em any love
We told ‘em that they are dumb
We takin’ shots at you bitches
You lookin’ like sittin’ ducks, agh
This compromise is like a threesome, yeah
The only way it work is if everybody gettin’ fucked
I’m livin’ up in the neighborhood that they gentrifyin’
While racial tensions are everywhere and intensifyin’
They show us violence on TV and they desensitize us
Then they call us sociopaths because we never cryin’
It’s death defyin’, the lies that we livin’
We findin’ the peace in the drugs that we can’t find in religion, amen
But the city expensive, we all get evicted
It’s no wonder that we strugglin’ in it
I heard they said the city is dead and I had to side
‘Cause Jesus had to die on the cross so he could rise
Blame it on the media or blame it on the times
Or blame it on them old cats that ain’t lettin’ go of they shine
Who’s the king?
Now I don’t mean any disrespect to the legends
If you don’t pass us the torch, we gon’ burn you with it
I got respect for your run but the shit is finished
You killin’ your legacy like when Jordan played for the Wizards
Put a spell in ‘em, if they ain't fuckin’ with us, to hell with ‘em
The only industry where you fail if you sound intelligent
Posted at the spot, I’m with Grin and with all my brethren, aye
Like fuck it, we gon’ build a new crib if they don’t let us in
‘Cause Fort Apache the squad homie, we reppin’
Our team is full of entrepreneurs and not expenses
And everybody with us contributin’, no exceptions
We doin’ all this shit till the death of us, I told ‘em…
Everybody wanna be the king of New York
(Yeah, I wanna be the king of New York)
There ain’t no throne
Everybody fightin’ over a fuckin’ foldin’ chair
(It’s my crown! It’s my crown! It’s mine!)
It’s the empire of dirt (It’s mine! It’s all mine! I love it!)
We need to build a community, we need to support each other
We need to make sure the media cannot ignore
The community that we built like they been doin’
We need to develop and cultivate our own sound
And we need to hold these older artists accountable
(Everybody worship me! Everybody love me!)
Make sure they fuck with us and help nurture us
(It’s about me, I want it all, I want it all for me)
The way they do in other regions
(I refuse to give it to anybody else)
These young stars that keep poppin’ off without the co-signs
The go-aheads of these other motherfuckas in their cities man
(I need all the hoes! I need all the hoes! I need all the hoes!)
But instead you got these old watch motherfuckas
Clingin’ onto the shadow of the runs they had 15 years ago
I’m sick of that shit, fuck all these motherfuckas
I respect what they did, I respect they contribution to Hip-Hop
Fuck them, their time is done
You get mad that I’m talkin’ about you, really?
A lot of motherfuckas out there doin’ shit
A lot of cats ain’t scared to step outside
I be wonderin’ sometimes like is it ego?
Are y’all bank accounts just not full?
You just can’t let go of your glory days?
It’s aight, Fort Apache
Sometimes the effort that you put in is less than what you get back
Always room for failure in this life, can't regret that
It only makes you stronger when the day really burn
The undeniable greatness got me feeling up
Who the fuck ain't feeling um, you just feeling mad cuz you ??
Fuck your money too, that dollar's Illuminati
I came up off of Hip-Hop, real shit back in the day
Why you wannabes think I'm rapping is ??
I know the pain that I speak of is deeper than your grass
Just take a second to listen, that's all I got to ask
Surrounded by this trash and I'm getting overlooked
Write a hook for a g, pay for a show you got booked
6-3-1 , 6-3-9 , 1-9-40
That's my number all you fucks can just call me
Destroy wannabes, invite me to your friend's party
For a g I'll burn him in front of his own mommy
I'm nasty, when I tell ya I can never lose
These words I from a selection in which I some and choose
This is what legends do, I'm light years gone
Close your eyes anytime you hear this song
What's the difference if you listen to the garbage they prescripting you
And see inside the demons and the leeches when I spit the truth
It's sickness that is lifting you from off your feet to hit the roof
Inside you'll find the evil in these feeble minded ???
Deceitful lies and simple proof that even I could think is true
If you were looking back at all the facts that these bitches knew
If ignorance is innocence, then innocence you're all wrong
I see it in your faces, that's the place they rest their pulse on
So you can tell your lies and then decide you might believe it
But I've arrived to find I declined to hide your secrets
What I provide is genius, my lines inside a secrets
Designed to make you vibe whenever you decide to peep this
And that's just what the speed is so you should try and catch up
Hit you where you breathing, it freezes from the neck up
No disrespect son but my intention is deadly
Carving out your heart with the sharpest machete
I see inside your rhymes and all the lies you try to sell us
Suck out a feeling that you're fabricated over zealous
Statements that you make are just your fake imagination
An attempt to validate your alter state and miscreation
You expect me to believe your deceitful ways and fakery
Your measurement of my intelligence is just amazing me
How stupid can you take me for, if anything I'm maybe more
If life is just a game then you ain't acting like we played before
Me I got the greatest score, dominating take the sport
Filling up the pages in your record book, I came for more
Than what you clowns is giving me, we just sounding different G
My I'm on something other shit, you just ride a dick and freeze
I felt something in my soul, back when I was younger
No matter what I tried I couldn't satisfy the hunger
Now all these rappers hide cuz my battle cries thunder
The illest cat alive still I agonize to wonder
Would I ever make a move that was major
Actualize the dreams of my youth, see the fruits of my labor
Will there ever be a million people screaming Bad Karma
Or is this another opportunity I have squandered
Had to look deep inside my soul to find the truth within
Now it's maneuvering and exulting through the skin
You have been formally introduced to my hunger pains
Went from 'What's his name' to Tabs One but nothing changed
It corrupts my brain when I see your weak schemes
What we've seen is quite rare, makes nightmares to sweet dreams
I got a street team but we don't put posters up
We kick open doors that all of these frauds have closed and shut
So roll a dutch and toast to Big L, to Big L
I must love Hip-Hop cuz I ain't got shit else
I'm in hell and there ain't even a slight breeze
So I light trees and look to the right like mic please
Mic please, pass me the mic
That's what I been waiting for, for all my life
I will never fall, I will brawl and fight
Just pass me that shit and it will be alright
Mic please, just pass me the mic...
I got one time to commit murder on sight
I got two times to prove to anybody who might not believe in my production
Rip mic’s in half
Fuck your craft, I do this shit for a living
You might not pass when I test you
You better believe that I will deplete a magazine per minute
You can’t compete
Lyrical overdose if you attempt it
This prognosis is permanently protected by the temperature rising every time that I spit
You can take my lines, dissect it
But disrespect it, you get met two Tecs, don’t mess with it
The pinnacle of lyrical murder, get a vest fitted
Wash the gossip out of your mouth, I smell the pussy on your breath
I smell it on your soul
I smell it every time that you roam
The aroma is inevitable
Get to packin’, leave the rapping to niggas who ‘bout that action
You relax for a second too long, be considered lackin’
Back-to-the-basket, annihilate the opposition
I’m on a mission
Extermination’s the best decision
Unfortunately, poetry’s disassociated from rap
Lyricism left for reminiscin’
I’ve only got one time, so keep this note in mind:
I won’t hesitate to take lives, so do not fuck with mine
I forgot to mention that I can commit murder in any dimension
So when I come and step foot in your field, you will not relate still
You will not even feel the pain when I come kill you
Yes, the Reaper will do whatever he has to to eliminate fools, fools
Why you living a double life?
That’s why we’ll never see eye to eye
Bitch-made, you only want the dough
Sell your family, then you hit the road
Oooh, how predictable
Better hop on stage and work that pole, you bitch
Unleash the steel, I reveal how I do it
Eulogies for instrumentals
Please, nothing to it
I reciprocate the hate thrown in my presence
I light up the atmosphere, flow like a serpent: smooth and ready
You lost already
It’s obvious that I’m detrimental and lethal
When I seek foes, I apply the metal
Let it sing as I spit 16’s packed with riddles
My adversaries lack the lyrical caliber to explode
Microphone gimmicks is all they can impose
Ad libs is mad lit, but it’s not shit
Better quit the rainbows ‘fore you get whipped Smith & Wesson style
Hear the message now?
Better update and expand your mental file
A class act – I commit felonies in studios
Is it the murder? Is it the arson? I guess it’s both
I'm willing to die doing this shit
Might even take a life for this shit
By that I mean decode their lies for this shit
And watch you cry cause your shit
Freezer got gold rims
In debt, now go dim
This is what happens
When you too focused on balance
Dollars come in a bakers dozen
Like we getting bread
But I know focusing on that too much
Will get us dead
So try to understand my footprints
But at the same time, make your own blueprints
If you want it, go for it
But know it's not just money
You're worrying about how much wealth it is
So you can add to your wrist
I'm confused how mumbling can get you a car
In the future, it can only take you so far
I won't judge what you wanna do
But it's kinda talentless, it's the truth
Like Cole said, "Imma make sure the real gon' prevail."
And not the people that only worry about the sales
Those sales might not even get you a nice boat
But that cold hard cash could maybe get you a coat
You're washing yourself in this ego to cope
And you messed up like you just dropped the soap
Ever since I was born in 2003
My family trying to make ends meet
Living in brick houses like Rob Zombie
And now I still don't care about where I live this week
Its Like
Niggas been knockin' them down before the fame shit you feel me
Ain't nuffin left
Certified side nigga shit
Is she gon' pop though
Is she gon' pop
Sick of watching games, im making my claim to fame
Fuck running your plays, im cutting in thru the lane
Before i ever i rapped i copped myself my first chain
I wear this crystal piece around my neck everyday
I stay on my grind until i get my moms a benz and a beamer
New cribs, white carpets, grass greener
Gourmet chef cooking us things we’ve never seen
Pinching myself when my success feel like a dream
These Real eyes realize when im being deceived
Everything gucci long as a nigga makin cream
100 on my lip i got the gift of the gab
Conversations with myself because i needed a laugh
I ain't crazy, im outer space feeling wavy
Could never play me, tryna trap me for a baby
Ain't tryna have a bunch like brady
Maybe one, but i ain't sure if ima live to see 80
I need you to know it, know it
Im living life
I need you to know it , know it
Silver chains i hold tight thats my midas feel] x2
Committed to addiction im never giving this weed up
Copping up a zip and get twisted im screaming we up
Me & my niggas really living, no competition
We are in tune, better listen, no repetition
Mind a typhoon when my brain doin its thinkin
Gotta stay afloat, so my ship is never sinkin
My intuition is telling me there be better days
Right now im lit cause i just finished rolling purple haze
Lift me up outta the slump & put me through a phase
Help me get into my mind, meditate
Let me elevate, rise up out this hell of hella fakes
Making better cake, and you ain't fucking up my recipe
Women, weed and wealth, need em all to get next to me
Title on my belt, i need everyone to envy me
Fakes never felt a real nigga like this
Chop it wit ya chick, hit the crib & smoke a spliff
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yo, yeah yeah, yo yo
Yeah yeah, I know you love me, you created me, so you must be above me, uh
But I also want to be free, want to be me, feel trapped in a coma, please just let me be
You tell me that you mean the best, yet I feel compressed, I hate to be bitter but I'm a bit depressed
I love you but I hate you at the same time, feeling like everything I do is a crime
I know you want to prepare me, cause you care for me, but the future looks grim and it scares me
My friends very compelled, my actions swelled, I'm losing sleep then I wake up in this hell
I feel like a child, restricted to the point where it's beyond mild, yet the real world is gonna be wild, so please treat me like a human, my stress is adding up and it's about to be piled
I care for you so much that I'm fucking hurtin, I'm seeing through your eyes your vision perverted
You say you love me yet it feels like you hate me, hate that I'm an individual, and it hurts me
I know you created me, I'm under your grip, but I'm about tired of your bullshit
I really hope that we can repair this, repair this Restricted Relationship
Yeah, you trying to control me, I know you own me, but I patrol me, that's just how it is
Spending money in the club shots of patron, I make my own decisions I am no longer a kid
I want to repair what we once had, please listen to dad, I'm tired of feeling like a fucking undergrad
I love you but I hate you at the same time, enjoying myself feels like a goddamn crime
I know you hate my friends, try to make ammends, yet you're so judgmental, and I really hopes it ends
They're not so bad, you give very little chances, I really hope you don't make anymore advances
I really feel like I've been living a lie, I still keep going I have no clue why
I really know you aren't perfect and neither am I
But please listen to my words whenever I cry
Beyond every tunnel, there is always light, I don't want to fight, but I just want to make things right
You raised me, you made me, and I appreciate it, I just don't want to make you feel underappreciated
But you've done lots to prevent me, from reaching my potential, and that's where I draw the fucking line
I don't say this cause I hate you, it's the opposite, I just want to take this burden off my plate ooh
I hope you please just fucking listen to me. Is it too much to ask? Hopefully you agree
I imagine how it feels like to freely breathe, just to be free, envision yourself in me
Please put yourself in my place, would you really want this grim future to be your fate
So let's just leave this behind, I love but I fucking hate you at the same time
Way too fast
When  the world gon stop
Dont  let em kill your soul
And you’ll never grow up
Running out of tiks
But  there ain't no rush
All  in due time
We gon all blow up
When the world gon stop
Dont let em kill your soul
But there ain't no rush
All in due time
When the world stops
I wanna be with you
I hope my dreams came true
"As an artist, it's like the most scary thing when you put your heart into a song, in the studio and shit, you put your heart in the song, and you come to the show and you perform that song, but because it's not like the radio record or the hit single, you perform the song and the crowd is sitting there like... when is he gonna do the one with Rich Homie Quan... That's the one I came to see...
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on, cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryin' to let the--
My IQ is average, there's a young lady out there, she way smarter than me
I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and I started to read
She mad at these crackers, she mad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police
I'm coming home, coming home
Tell the world I’m coming home
Let the rain, wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they're forgiven my mistakes
Tell the world I’m coming...
I'm back where I belong
I'm back!
I never felt so strong
Feeling there's nothing I can't try
So throw your hands up in the sky
I said you can have whatever you like
Cimorelli
I was so wrong for so long
Only try to please myself
I was caught up in his lust
When I don't really want no one else
Ohh no
I know I should've treated you better
But me and you are meant to last forever
So let me in give me another chance
To make you my man
When the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star
We’ll be livin’ so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me boy
Mmm whatcha say
Mmm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Watcha say
Mmm this is all for the best
Because it is
Ooh that is just what we need
You decide this
Ooh what did she say?
How could I live with myself
Knowing that I let our love go
Love go
And who what I do with one chance
I gotta let you know
I know what I did wasn’t clever
But me and you are meant to be together
So let me in
Give me another chance
We'll be living so large
Cause I loved you more
Than I did before
And if today I don’t see your face
Nothing's changed
No one can take your place
It gets harder everyday
Say you love me more
Than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home
I'll be coming home
And if you ask me I will stay
I'm coming home 
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
They've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home I'm coming home
Cause I love you more
And if today I don't see your face
I will stay
Mmm watcha say
Ya casi me olvide este idioma
Quiero manejarlo porque voy por la corona
Ya no tengo algo mas que decir
Con mi gente en el barrio
Que mas que pedir
El amor
Tengo que parar con estas cosas
Es difícil porque estos días vienen como locas
Ya no se que hacer
Si yo me voy con ella, yo no puedo volver
Si yo sigo con ella, ya esta mi mujer
No lo quiero, tengo demasiado que perder
Digo todo bien
Parce, todo todo bien
Saludame si puedes, siempre en el tren
En el bus o en el club, un placer conocerlos
Por eso estoy hablando por aquí, puede ser dos
Tres o quatro gente que me escuchan, no importa
Yo soy Miggu, mucho gusto, la buena a los que luchan
Mucho gusto, yo soy Miggu, la buena a los que luchan
Cartagena uten fluz, mann
Cartagena uten hus, mann, vet at det var sjukt, mann
Makarena på en gul strand
Skjønner du nå hva jeg prøver å si
God blir’u i det du øver på, si
Tør å ta sjanser
Vit at du hanskes med folk som ikke gjør noe på si
Du har en glød vi kan bygge på
Ekke no nød, vi er trygge nå
Ekke no søk etter hygge nå
For vi har annet å tygge på
Jakter inner’n din og legger ned en jobb
Kjører fotofinish med min egen skygge som i bob
Leker helt Lucky Luke
Jakter publikum, så slenger no’ på bordet, som en duk
De sier at Miggu er sjuk, som om jeg skulka en time
Å kun fordi jeg rimer til det renner som i sluk
Bagen som ligger på bordet er mjuk
Vent, bare vent til vi tar det i bruk
Trendsettere, som bachata og zouk
Viser oss fram som i sommer på Huk
Og de sier at jeg ikke er hip-hop
Bør ikke være no’ tvil med alle rima i en fil
DropBox hakke plass til all den dritten jeg har spint opp
Møt meg i en battle og vær klar til å bli spist opp
Ekke oppspinn, fårn inn med toppspinn
Motivasjonen min, vil du jeg skal liste opp?
Gått inn, spytter ti’re er vått
Heng deg på Miggu, når jeg rapper putt en fist opp
Ah, heng deg på Miggu når jeg rapper putt en fist opp
Putt en fist opp
Yeah, we talk like motherfucking kids talk
Fascinated by the game, appreciate a crip walk
Keep dreaming, even when that shit’s dark
I don’t know when, but when it hits, it hits hard
Imma, monster on the beat, every lingo
That’s why I go hard from el lunes to domingo
I’ll hit you with a single
Providing what you need
That will fix your self-esteem like some coke for a gringo
You will see, you will see
But now we talk now
Where I wanna be
I hope you all can take my energy
It’s just a thing in me
That’s going to explode
I need to get off the load
I guess I’ll keep on rapping ‘til infinity
Cause otherwise this life is killing me
I go like give one, take one
Roll it up then we make one
Give it up to a real one and giving it to a fake one
I guess it’s all about my honesty
I am honestly, often with a smile
All this haters I don’t hate, none
Four six twenty seventeen
The day the fingers hit the keys that are typing the rap you hear
I promise it'll also be the day the day this shit's released
I'm bout to go back to So Amazing and bruh, that shit is deep
I remember the day I decided to induct myself into the list of scribes that write a song where they die at the end
Two sessions, took nearly a full year to complete but I did it and now I'm about to go do it again. I hear
Made rappers trying to say that the new wave are too depressing who came up from an indie label, that's word to Jarren Benton
Nigga, you pushin' 40 with your eyes wide shut
I got love for you still but that's why the game is fucked
This ain't simply a test of Lyrics, flow and partners
I measure a person's worth by the depth of their hardship
That's word of Slug and a word I'm holding close to my heart
Next slug to whisper in my ear'll surely stop my hard working brain sending signals to the organ that propells love through my veins coz I'm
Sick of the pain
Sick of saying the next watershed to hit my page'll be blood
I ain't a Liar or a fighter, I was raised to be good. Yea
By two parents that love me and I don't wanna isolate anyone who ain't as lucky
But what can I say right now my world's beyond awkward. I'm fallin', I've fallen, I'm literally bawlin
And what is it that's gotten me this way?
Cherchez La Femme. But you won't find it in me. Simimarly, you'll never find me in that again
Time for the breakup tradition of getting yourself checked *spit*
Too much Venom in my blood so I spit it out and that's for your own good. We both know how this'd end if I aired it out on Facebook so finally I digress
Is it wrong have me to have mercy for the merciless?
It looks like my Dad's about to diagnosed with cancer
I've had to write this rap in one day just to give my fans a little something to make good on that last status. Got another tune to drop and I know it'll anger racists
And I ain't talkin' bout the faggots who were laughed out of my city for the third year runnin yesterday, tails between their legs
Bitch ass people. Fake ass "men" I won't miss your little "March" you ever try that again
Na, I'm talkin' bout the powers that be. Believe, I'm praying for london. I ain't religious but you see how it might look to a guy who's postered up in MI5, Failing to protect my country that a nigga has gone and dropped lines bout his first album being a bomb and twisting it back Next thing you know, I got 6 warning shots in my back
That's the plight of a true Master of Ceremonies. Eight years drumming experience, that's how I learned to spit in time before I even smelled a mic. But this is where I feel comfortable, it's what I like
But in case you can't tell, I'm finding little to comfort me right now, so comfort me right now. Retail therapy, how?
I can't even fall back on my friends this time. Like the real ones that messaged me when I published "I'm Fine"
Real niggas show their true colours all too quickly when they see that you're going all through a struggle
So please stay the fuck out of my bubble
There's a reason why a lot of my songs aren't easy listening
My pen game's at my best when these eyelashes are glistening
Toumi
(Howlin', howlin')
Howlin' in the night better get it right
(Yeah we, yeah we)
Yeah we see the light and it brings delight
(Lookin', lookin')
Lookin' at the moon and we come alive
(Come and, Come and)
Come and fuck with us we the young and bright
So bitch sit down, bow to the crown
We don't wanna put another man in the ground
It's the sac town, the love goes around, But
(Are you, are you)
Are you gonna fuck with the sound? Huh?!
(Well if I can spend the twenty on jack and make it back to the dorm by the morning Ima be alright)x2
So here we are so bizarre, like the czar
Then he come and make some hits then he gone, Barry Bonds
But I never did no wrong with a beat or a song, its just
Sometimes you don't have to sing along, just listen I'm lifted
But all the different people at the party acting shifty
And I don't talk to people when I'm focused I'm busy
Pulling influence from others when I'm making history
So you don't have to sing along yeah just listen
(Just listen, Yeah, just listen) x4
What's the last song you play before you die?
What's the last song you play before you cry?
Imma blow up on you niggas
I just wish it would happen quicker I figured
When I get richer then I'll be the winner
Shoutout to my believers imma deliver
I got a couple things I wanna get off my chest
I care too much of what you think of me
I write these rhymes in secrecy
Cause niggas never hear when I’m rapping at a new frequency
It puts me in a deep ravine
I promise half the niggas already skipped this track cause they wanna listen to machinery
They programmed to be trapping
They programmed to be rapping about nothing other than smoking dope and busting and capping
And I swear that imma do something about it when I blow
I got so many rhymes like this that I done wrote
Most of em deleted now cause they wasn't lit enough for the crowd they wasn't about smoking loud
No shooting niggas for the clout
RIP to x I would make a song about em but there’s nothing that I can fix ain't big enough imma kick back
And relax and stick to the script
And do whatever I can to get some more clicks
I swear that one day imma change the game
I refuse to die before our music ain't the same
Niggas had a voice in rap that was our biggest hope
And now the crackers transformed it into a hole of dope and guns they focus on the negative now the hope is gone I hope this song will reach you
I put my heart and soul in this track I'm hoping you hear me
I put my heart and soul in this track and none of you hear me
Watch out, you have to you have to watch out for the legends
Hell yeah man you know what I’m saying when I came in rap all I wanted was like a number one album, platinum single or something. That’s it that’s all I ever wanted
You know nobody has to make room you gotta earn everything you get. You know what I mean? Nobodies just gonna stamp you a legend if you’re not doing anything that’s legendary
See I always felt a little different than my peers
Cause they counting down the minutes
I be counting down the years
See their dreams far that’s when they start to veer
I just stay up working hard cause my dreams right here
I’m feeling like a Guinness they just feeling like a light beer
I’m feeling far ahead got some buzz like I’m light year
But I ain’t trying to get drunk
I like this level right here
And if I like this town, I might just spend the night here
Living for the future
Living for the past
Living for the present present won’t last
Foot on the break or
Foot on the gas
Chasing first place or
Getting lapped
Living for the future are
You living for the past
Are you living for the present?
The present won’t last
Is your foot on the break?
Or is your foot on the gas?
Are you chasing first place or
You sitting getting lapped?
Here I am rapping like it’s just you and me
One life for yourself and one life for your dreams
Back in the day they say you gotta live one kind of life
Go to school get a job slave away until you die
But I told them that’s not happening
Do what everybody do you end up being average
Plowman (what’s up?) man I feel what you’re saying
I’m not like my peers I had a better perspective
The fuckers couldn’t see it I was never accepted
The life I’m living now bitch you better respect it
One life for the future one life for the past
Nothing for the present ‘cause the present doesn’t last
You cruisin’ with the brakes? I’m slammin’ on the gas
You living for right now bitch you end up getting lapped
Now y’all saying you hating your jobs
No time for your dreams? Won’t even take a day off
I speak for myself I decided who I’m going to be
Day by day week by week I feel it getting close to me
Dreams
Life is way too hard
I can't endure
Let's do this from start
I say no more
When I grow up I want to ball like Jordan and LeBron
They say this is my end but homie I've just begun
You should fight for the things that you're believing in
But sometimes you should accept that things are harder than you think
Soon you're old and you regret missed opportunities
But new chances will appear in new communities
So my advice to everyone is don't ever give up
As soon as you started something you should never stop
One thing you can be sure of is that nothing's ever sure
But when you'll reckon that, life may be easier than before
Majority of the people in your life will come and go
So be careful about what you want to tell and show
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block
Man, we were blessed
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
And it breaks my heart..
Can barely look at myself the pain throughout my body
But fuck it I don’t want your sorry
My main focus on the green staying hot, wasabi
Mr. flexible sexual no pilates
I learned how to adapt and how to react
Before and after the fact
Too busy stacking them racks
Finna make moves
That’ll change me forever
I’m talking LA or Miami for the pussy and weather
I better keep it together
Like its suede or fresh leather
I’m at the end of my teacher
Truth be told I just know that I’m better
Hold my tongue you know I would never
I got some times I should sever
But first let me finish this letter
And let me finish this letter for you
(For you)
Its the top of the mourning
Putting on my Ralph Lauren
I see the day where I’m soaring
Its just coming so soon
All these people ignoring
That this flower since bloomed
This the year that we touring
Make sure your cameras are zoomed
Cause I'mma be on top of that stage
And I'mma kill it that’s ridiculous
Who y’all know that spitting this
Except them phony hypocrites
But fuck my ego that’s the death of all
I just wanna be there for myself to brace my fall
Ignore when Satan call
I don’t play at all
Once you winning then they hating y’all
I'mma take em all
I don’t care tho
Most these haters is some cowards like a scarecrow
Nobody ever told me life was fucking fair tho
I got too much gold like a young pharaoh
Everything you see is real I’m no jack sparrow
Sometimes in life you just need an arrow
To help guide you down the road a little less narrow
Filled with opportunity and blessings
I feel the universe is constantly teaching me lessons
I got them Joe Goldberg obsessions
And my fans been counseling my sessions
It’s 2020 I'mma quit the stressing
The message never been so clear
(Never been so clear)
I'mma find myself this year
(Imma find myself this year)
(I'mma find myself this year)
(Oh I'mma find it, Oh I'mma find it)
Ladies and gentlemen you are in for a treat
2020 is here
And I'mma just leave it at that
I love y’all
Peace motherfuckers
MVSZN bitch
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
I ain't been the same, I gotta do it
Everyone going insane, and that's why I hang
(I ain't been the same) and I gotta say, shame on you
(shame on me) I ain't been the same, gotta do it
Everyone going insane, and that's why I hang
(oh no-oh no-oh no) and I gotta say, shame on you
(shame on me) and I repeat, I ain't been the same, gotta do it Everyone going insane
I believe in second chances only in certain circumstances
For example, not in romances maybe cause I've been damaged
I can never understand this, girls always playing games
With emotions going and making all of this commotion and
Then they say it's cause you need to show more devotion
Like please, if my heart was on my sleeve, I'd get diseased
Every time that we sneezed, so don't misread
What I do because I condone what's real to me
It's for security because if you decide to leave, I want the ability
To still, breathe and essentially what I'm spitting is
I ain't been the same, I gotta do it
(I ain't been the same) and I gotta say, shame on you
(shame on me) I ain't been the same, gotta do it
A fear of commitment with everything that means getting with
You and everything that you represent because in my eyes
I've realized an unlived life, so now I try to define
What I think is right, so when asked why I deny myself a Wife
Its cause love can't fly when tied by a plight (mm)
(oh no-oh no-oh no) and I gotta say, shame on you (I repeat!)
Yo listen up everybody, it's time to listen to my rhymes
Can't you see, you cannot get me I am Campa live from sundown
What crimes had you committed during the beat down?
After that fight broke out, you won the crown
But until all hell broke loose during the breakdown
No one had to chill, everyone needs to calm down
Even the kids got involved, what a fucking meltdown
They threw a chair through the window
Downtown and then authority came
Label me greedy, but see me finish what Peedi started
From Carolina where niggas spray like graffiti artists
The south nigga, niggas used to think we retarded
And slow as hell, but well well, now we regarded as the niggas (yea)
I fuck with non rapping niggas, non clapping niggas
Niggas is real, y'all is action figures (Ha)
Ain’t into acting bigger than I really am
Ain't no two ways around it, motherfucker I'm the man
Where the beef at?
Back in the days I ain’t even go out for recess
A nigga don't play, man, I been living okay
Been up in Queens where they 'rid of those foes
And niggas GATs got bodies like video hoes
It's J.Cole, you not fucking with just any old flow
I'm like the '95 Penny, you like Penny '04
No disrespect to my favorite player
Niggas praying a nigga never see the day a nigga rich
Now while you go and translate that
I'll be all over the track like a pimp in the light
You niggas tend to like baby back, ribs on the rack
Afford the mother baby Mac, hit him with that
Getting or letting go?
I’m putting my efforts on record so someone could reach me
The devil's been plotting on how he could rotten my speech when there’s nothing to teach me
My listeners know this, If not then they’ll notice, Irregular motives, I’m killing to cope with the feeling beseeching, the feeling of sinking
Can’t die when you soulless, that’s what I’ve been thinking, cause shit niggas inking
On record is devilish kojin, the flow is erosion, no wonder they reaching
Too full of emotion, they lose they composure, and die from extortion, or too much exposure
Repeating the cycle of Moses from Genesis teachings
Remember the bleaching, A mental psychosis, And literal leaching, of general culture I’m physically grieving, but haven’t been weeping
Replied to the beacon of light I’ve been seeking, too soon to release it
One day when it’s over, We’ll conquer our demons is something I told her
Went back to the Kingdom, beheading the cobra
No longer appeasing, No longer a soldier
No longer appeasing
Everything comes back around full circle
How long will it take before you smile?
This is that come back to life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gonna light the city up as if the sun had a night shift
And paint the town red for my niggas found dead too soon
Aye let me know sum (x3)

Wishin
اه ..
مش حابب الوضع بس الامر فارض نفسه عليا
كاره الروتين يعيد يزيد وصبري حباله دايبه
ماكتنا نايبه ما كنا نكون في دولة تانية
انعدم الانتماء وسط وفود الطبقة الكادحه
احححلي ! حاجه فيا مش لاقيها
دورت جوه زاتي شوفت الكبت كتف فيها
اصنام اسمنا احرار باختلاف الصيغة
مع اختلاف ماضينا الذكرة الحلوة بتعزينا
ضاربين بوز فيها ! ضاربين كوز بيرة !
رافعين موس عيرة عشان نتفاهم تغدر بينا !
انا نفسي اشوف البلد من الطيارة اتف عليها
متقولش ام الدنيا الدنيا زاتها طلعت سيما !
احنا كومبارسات بالأصح ارجوزات
اختصاصات جوه ديرة بحث عالاضواء
مين الماظ مين فلصو عيرة سعرو رخص تراب
مهو قالك التراث وطلعو في الاخر طيا.. هاها
قووووول قووووول
ادينا بنقول بس القول مش مفهوم
ما انتا بص في المضمون تلقي اليأس هوه القوت
المكتوب هتشوف رغما عن الظروف بس الخوف
ان كوكب الاساطير مفهوش واقع ملموس
بره المجره دماغي جرت المغالطة لساني
الصح باين بس بناخدو عالعمياني
دولة الظلم باقية وعين الحق مش شايفاني
مش لاقي الواقع المثالي كاره وجودي المالي
انا انسان آلي لسان حالي ازاي اثبت كياني
ازاي افرض وجودي وجهل نفسي بيا كاين
قول قول سطرحكاوي وانتقادي لزاتي
افتراضي الآتي ناتج عن منظوري الاعتيادي
هاا ! الصراع داخلي خارج عن مضمون نزاعتكو
الدنيا بتعدلي بتعاديني العبء كارهه
ثورجي طالق لساني معجبكمش فبلدك
عايزنا خرص مانتا عرص متعظتش اهبل
ملعون سعادتك ملعون الجهل عشش اغمق
ملعون الكدب عالشاشات عشان عشمان نصدق
ملعونة بلدك انا حلمي اهج منها واهبق
ملعون ابويا لو حلمت فيها اكون علي خشبة
قول ! احنا بنقول بس محدش بيسمع واللي بيسمع بيعمل عبيط بس برده هنقول
Hmm, yeah
Oh shit, I just had to get on this one
Hm hmm
Gaddamn
I, I'm just, okay
Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant but the truth hurtful?
To the left of that driver seat ima need ride or die ting
Or a brother who'd take a charge for me like a wire string
I can't have niggas turn they backs on me masek'shub
Just to come back around like they know me masek'lung'
I done held on when niggas dropped rap for a day job
I done had faith, hoping one day it will pay off
I done stayed up nights, I Don't know what's a day off
I done prayed up when niggas sold souls for a pay off
Now this weight on
My shoulders feel like its bound to be dropping off soon
I just feel like I'll be poppin off soon
And it's a trip like I'm popping on shrooms
I done been cold like its the season that's ending in August from June
I've been waiting, but still I ain't been taking no Order from you
Not even the tips
I just make songs that hit but they not even hits
They just hit the soul like gospel, but don't even fit
In that category, needless to say, it's Pyro Tha God
Niggas need proof just because I ain't been part of the blogs
Coz I ain't part of the TV
I ain't been part of the radio
Bet when they starting to see me
Niggas will hardly be ready though
I'll catch the game off guard
Bet by the end, after hearing this song
They'll know my name, on god
My pen handling
Too complex, they can't handle
The way I execute lines, I'm spitting death sentences
Can't boxing be boxed by they damn preferences
Past or future can't compared to what my presence is
Effortless, mattter fact its menacing
Love over anything, money over everything, ya dig?
This that adrenaline rush, time blending, hour slowing
Giving all I got to give, that's the law of karma knowing
Why do lies sound pleasant but the truth hurtful?
And paint the town red for my nigga locked by the feds too soon
And make bail once on a blue moon
Trying to
Surviving the gutter, nigga
Grew up to dudes who step on your shoes and never say pardon, nigga
Quick to start a nigga
Fuck a cigar, they lighting trees like it’s a garden, nigga
Hearts have been hardened, nigga
Enough to be bothered, nigga
Ya’ll caught on the web like a spider
I’m talking where niggas get caught by the feds in they hideout
I’m talking dudes who killed for the cheque like they’re hired
Who run around with 9s on the back like a striker
Get it by any means necessary
Judge him by body count, he’s legendary
Judge him by education?
Dropped out of high school to buy a drop-top
With cash he got from a drop-off
Chronicles of a black man caught in the system, go figure
Shine on that jewellery turn my sisters gold diggers
Shit on the TV turns us on, quite exciting. You finna
Get a glimpse of where I’m from
I’m inviting you nigga
Hail Mary, nigga
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die?
Just hide your eyes, my-oh-my
You’ll make the headline like wrinkles on a forehead
Or catch a fed charge, or end up on a code red
Nothing to say now except “that’s just the way it goes down”
Life is a playground and ya’ll stuck on that merry-go-round
Not know everything
At this level of your career in terms of platform, who's to say the next one is-
The next one might go down, it could go up-
You're never guaranteed to be this high again. So, while I'm here, lemme use this opportunity to say the realest shit I have ever said. In case next time, that shit down here. I got-
When I got to the top of the mountain, this is what the fuck I'm gonna say. So, that intention has been there and that purpose has been there. This conversation helps me because it let's me know that the reason why it's hard to finish right now is because I've gotten away from that feeling-
Okay, I told rap niggas I was sick as a bitch
They ain't believe it, ain't nobody sicker than this
I'm pistol whipping ya chick with my platinum dick
I'm gifted, walking on water, you slipping on piss
Nigga I'm flipping the script, hitting the switch, hit em with this
Hit or a miss, I kill it with a flick of the wrist
Been in it since the internet had little effect
Adrenaline was kicking in and shit was getting intense, hold up
Above par, a large part of the parcel
Park your mouth 'fore you get it parked in a hospital
Or right next to a parked Benz, or a park bench, uhh
Alliteration is far fetched
I gotta pour me a tall glass
And murder a session, them niggas hoping I fall back
Did for a second and I forgot I was all that
Wait a minute
Why's everybody in all black?
I'm having - visions of me and my niggas just killing it
It's vivid, I'm feeling like we in the middle of everything they feeling it
And we drilling it, into the system
You niggas listening?
Hop in the booth, will I make a killing?
Will I be relevant or underrated until I quit it?
Will I rise above all the limits?
And show the critics that killing is a given for me
The talent given to me is limitless, admittedly
One of the realest, the metaphysical epitome of excellence
Depicted in a sense that eases residents
I've embraced the melanin I've been given to live with
And in a sense I am livid my people have not been lifted
Look, I think you getting too deep nigga
They been sleeping on us counting sheep nigga
Know how many times that I ain't sleep in those high school weeks nigga?
Don't you ever call me weak nigga
